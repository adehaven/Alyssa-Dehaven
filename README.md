## Data and Visualizations of Interest
In this section, I explore harry potter social network density and sentiments based on the Harry Potter fanfiction, manacled or data visualizations to represent rates of foster youth in education based on county and district in southern california 
### Example Topics:
- *policy analysis:**Analysis of whether policy and budget should be expanded to fit increase or stagnate number of youth in foster care .
- *social network density/theme:**Under a close analysis of reading NLP of a text, there can be a visualization of the theme of the story and the characters network density

### Ideas for Data to Investigate
I am interested to see if there is a budget allocation for foster youth based on county density. Also I am interested to see if there is 

### Specific Dataset Ideas:
- **Government Data:** Analysis of government data on how many enrolled foster youth there are by district and school.
- **Educational Data:** Examination of student performance metrics and their correlation with various socio-economic factors.
- **Downloaded Data:** Data made to analyze the text of the focused story. 


### Curated Dataset Ideas:
- **Kaggle Datasets:** Exploration of popular datasets on Kaggle to help compare fanfiction to orignal story.
- **Government Databases:** Utilization of publicly available government datasets like census data.
- **Academic Research:** Leveraging datasets from academic research that could provide contexts into foster youth policy.


## conclusion 
*I will be assessing varying aspects and curating data sets from the fanfiction and/or the foster youth data
