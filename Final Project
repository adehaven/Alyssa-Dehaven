# Introduction 
*In the enormous landscape of fanfiction lies the monopolization of the world of Harry Potter. With over 1 million fanfictions estimated to exist, it is a wonder of the intricacies that drive the continuation of the Harry Potter phenomenon. Within fanfiction, works of canonical and non-canonical elements vary,  therefore offering a great deal of exploration and analysis. Fanfiction enables the 'playing' with already created fictional universes as writers try to extend the fiction to come up with new tales that might or may not differ from the initial creation or the canon of the story. This paper addresses a challenging question: What are some of the differences in themes in canon versus non-canonical stories, and which variables explain the popularity of non-canonical stories?

**Research Topic and Question:

*Canonical works, as those in the official books, movie, or television series, are set by the creators themselves and normally stick to a particular outline on a narrative structure, character development, and thematic focus. Fanfics, as non-canonical stories, provide for creative deviation from that laid-down canon to let authors explore some alternative situations, characters, and themes. This study will contrast and compare the thematic elements in canon and non-canon stories, noting how these themes are treated and received differently in these two types of narratives.
The primary research question is: How are the themes different in canonical as opposed to non-canonical stories? This will look into an analysis of how such key themes like love, negativity/positivity, identity, and evaluate which are or are not represented in both types of stories. The study also hopes to understand what elements in the non-canonical stories make them so highly regarded by readers. This research will therefore help to look into those variables in fanfiction, such as originality, emotional resonance, and character development, that make them popular in order to pinpoint exactly what it is about the non-canonical narratives that is particularly endearing and relevant to the larger fan population.
Motivation behind the study of this topic:
Knowing how canon and non-canon stories are different in their themes opens up a bigger picture on the dynamics of fan engagement and creativity. This particular lens that fanfiction provides enables the exploration, reinterpretation, and reimagining of favored characters and settingsá…³quite often attending to gaps or limitations within the original canon. These different forms of fanfiction point out the differences and enlighten us on how to further appreciate the contribution it makes to the continuous evolution of fictional worlds and the many forms by which audiences relate to such stories.

**Previous Work in This Area:

*Research into the topic of fan studies, in its relation to literary analysis, has in the past scrutinized several lines of inquiry concerning fanfiction. These subjects include fanfiction's relationship with canon, the act of expanding narrative universes, and the consequences for fan communities. The available literature will be harnessed to drive home the thematic differences between canonical and non-canonical stories, as well as the different drivers for the popularity of fanfictions. Drawing from the approaches in narrative theory, genre, and digital humanities, the research intends to distinctly contribute to the nuance in understanding how fanfiction relates to, interacts with, and transforms pre-set created fictional worlds.
 More specifically, it will be an investigation of the differences in themes between the canon themed fanfiction and the non-canon themed fanfiction, with an eye toward illuminating why these stories enjoy such appeal among those who have chosen to write non-canonical material. Of course, such an analysis has the potential to delve into the intricate dynamics of relationships that hold between official narratives and fan-made material in a way that makes fanfiction symptomatic of modern literary cultures.
