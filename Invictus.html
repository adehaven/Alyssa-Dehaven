<b><br/>September 3, 1945</b>
</p><p align="center">
<em> The Start of Tom Riddle’s 7th Year… </em>
</p><p align="center">
<strong> </strong>
</p><p align="left">Tom Riddle sat at a round marble-top table, which was spread with a delectable dinner for the Slug Club. A single white rose laden with static drops of dew was suspended in the air, spinning in the center of the table. To his right sat Abraxas Malfoy. On his left, Maximillian Dolohov. He glanced counter-clockwise around the the table, his dark eyes taking stock of the faces of Avery, Rosier, Nott, Mulciber, Lestrange…  all of his knights sat in perfect order around him, fanning out from his person like appendages. He cast a perfunctory glance at the other faces in attendance, noting Minerva McGonagall and Ambrosius Flume. A useless Gryffindor and a notorious Ravenclaw kiss-ass. His eyes fell on Druella Rosier, Alphard Black and beside him, Walburga Black, who met his glance in turn with a deep blush that crept down her neck. He inclined his head politely, the corner of his mouth turning upward slightly before he blinked away from her stare. </p><p align="left">He would use her later.</p><p align="left">The first Slug Club meeting of the year went as expected. His knights performed admirably on his behalf, plying Slughorn with veiled questions and warm praise. They discussed the unfortunate incident with Hopper Clemons that occurred over the summer.</p><p align="left">“It’s too bad, really,” mourned Avery.</p><p align="left">“He was a swell chap, after all,” sighed Nott with a shake of his head.</p><p align="left">“He was a pretentious git,” Abraxas whispered to Tom, his voice low, unheard by the rest of the table. </p><p align="left">Tom gave a hint of a smirk, then muttered under his breath, “He’s a Gryffindor, what do you expect?”</p><p align="left">“Wasn’t he meant to be Head Boy?” murmured McGonagall, flicking her eyes at Tom.</p><p align="left">“Never confirmed. Has anyone heard news of his progress?” asked Mulciber, casting a guarded glance Tom’s way.</p><p align="left">“<em>Merlin</em>, but the boy is doing <em> much </em> better,” muttered Slughorn. “However, he will be recovering for another month or so, at least, at St. Mungo’s before he will be able to attend school again. Pity, really. Nasty curse. Still no idea who cast it. He was quite prodigious, I’ve been told, in both Arithmancy and Transfiguration. His father is on a solid path of accomplishment in the Ministry, he‘s got a seat on the International Confederation of Wizards. I had him over for tea last winter. Brilliant fellow, he gifted me with an aged elf-made wine, bottled in 1902...”</p><p align="left">Tom watched the Slytherin Head of House drone on, his features schooled into a polite mask as he tuned out the man’s self-absorbed drivel. He picked at his food, unable to stomach eating at the moment. His mind couldn’t rest on anything but the task at hand. It was a nervous habit of his; he grew anxious when in pursuit of his ambitions and lost his appetite. No one would ever guess it. His expression was always one of cool self-possession. But inside his own mind and body, he would always sweat a bit. His ambition, after all, was the only thing he had in the world.</p><p align="left">He took a sip of the dark, Elf-made wine that Slughorn had surreptitiously filled his goblet with. Being the Slug’s favorite student came with a few enjoyable benefits. He lifted his glass at the same time as the professor, and the teacher gave him a knowing glance and a nod, with a silent “cheers” in the air before they both imbibed generously. It reminded him of the rich muggle cognac he found in the butler’s pantry at Riddle House last year. He had said cheers then as well… to the three dead bodies littering the floor.</p><p align="left">Both the taste and the memory soothed his nerves.</p><p align="left">He twisted the black and gold ring on his finger, his thumb stroking the facets of the stone lovingly.</p><p align="left">When the dinner had concluded and the necessary mingling subsided, Tom stood and waited politely as the other students filed out of the room. Walburga approached him and looked up at him seductively, batting her long lashes over crystal blue eyes. </p><p align="left">“Are we <em> studying </em> tonight, Tom?”</p><p align="left">His black eyes bore into hers coldly from beneath his dark brows. She would likely mistake the lingering look for hunger. It was irritation. </p><p align="left">He leaned down to her (he was nearly a foot taller) and muttered, “Maybe later.” The words came out more impatiently than he intended, but he had other things weighing on him. </p><p align="left">He had <em> plans.</em> </p><p align="left">He always had plans, and those plans were all that had ever mattered to Tom.</p><p align="left">After all, what else possibly <em> could </em> matter?</p><p align="left">There was nothing and no one <em> else </em> in his life. No one <em> worthy, </em>anyway.</p><p align="left">He looked back down at the witch as she boldly dragged her fingernail down his tie. He didn’t like this display of ownership, least of all in front of Slughorn. He had the urge to cut her finger off with a slicing hex.</p><p align="left">Walburga desired him, despite his mixed blood status. They <em> all </em> did. Despite his useless muggle father. His Gaunt blood likely mitigated the paternal side of his lineage, distasteful as it was.</p><p align="left">Walburga was notoriously committed to the idea of blood purity… but Tom was the exception. He was always the exception within these halls. </p><p align="left">He hated and loved <em> always </em> being the exception. Another one of the many contradictions within the person of Tom Riddle.</p><p align="left">The duality of his nature was difficult to put any kind of definition to. His own motivations were, at times, quite elusive and confusing to himself.</p><p align="left">He was both calculating and impulsive. He was at times cold and emotionless, and at others, quite passionate.</p><p align="left">He demanded utmost trust and loyalty, while being completely incapable of bestowing trust himself. He was only loyal to himself.</p><p align="left">Despite his contradictory and confusing nature, there was one unquestionable motive that he possessed which preceded all others: the reach for power.</p><p align="left">His eyes once more raked over the witch in front of him.</p><p align="left">He had chosen her specifically because of her staunch beliefs on blood purity.</p><p align="left"><em> She </em> loved that he <em> chose </em> her.</p><p align="left"><em> He </em> loved that she tossed her <em> ideals </em> out the window to be degraded at his every whim.</p><p align="left">He couldn’t even fuck her most of the time unless he imagined doing violent things to her. He could admit that he loved the idea of coating her pure-blooded tongue with his cum. What would mommy and daddy Black say?</p><p align="left">He loved to defile and control that which he could never aspire to become.</p><p align="left">He may never be powerful because of an immaculate lineage or generational wealth. </p><p align="left">But he would be the master of his own fate.</p><p align="left">He could- No, he <em> would </em> be feared. He was already insurpassably more magically powerful than any of his contemporaries. Those same pure-bloods would carry out his wishes and heel at his command like a pack of dogs. He would let nothing stand in his way.</p><p align="left">He would be unyielding. </p><p align="left">Immortal.</p><p align="left">
<em> Invictus. </em>
</p><p align="left">The other students had left. Slughorn was vanishing the remnants of the dinner from the table with his wand. He wondered why he didn’t just leave it for the house elves, but kept the comment to himself.</p><p align="left">Now was his chance. He jerked his head toward the door, indicating that she should leave him alone with the Professor.</p><p align="left">Walburga pursed her lips.</p><p align="left">“At your <em> leisure </em> , my <em> Lord </em>,” she mewled as she exited the office.</p><p align="left">The muscles in his jaw ticked in irritation.</p><p align="left">He pursued women only as pawns in his schemes. He learned early on that most women couldn’t stomach his peculiar tastes. Women had never fascinated him as they did his peers. Neither did men, for that matter. But women in particular, he’d found, had strange motives. He only liked them when he was forcing them to serve his purposes.</p><p align="left">He supposed that was also true of men. But men, he could better comprehend.</p><p align="left">Women always fell for his charm and his good looks. He hated that. It reminded him of how his mother had fallen in love with his devastatingly handsome, albeit useless muggle father. Tom didn’t want to be desired because he was handsome. He wanted to be feared because he’d achieved what no wizard had ever been able to achieve. He wanted to be the greatest wizard alive, purely by way of his own undeniable power and influence. </p><p align="left">Still, his handsomeness was a tool that he had no issue leaning upon when necessary.</p><p align="left">
<em> Perhaps the one useful gift you gave me, Father. Thanks for that, I suppose. </em>
</p><p align="left">Walburga wanted to be the one he turned to for <em> those </em> things. Sex and intimacy, or what she imagined intimacy was, anyway. She wanted to be able to brag to the other slytherin girls about how she’d snagged him, Salazar’s heir. The devastating <em> Tom Riddle </em>. She wanted to tell them how he was in bed. How he’d looked into her eyes passionately as he came. </p><p align="left">When, in actuality, he’d stuffed his slytherin tie in her irritating mouth and fucked her roughly with his wand against her throat, cutting off her air supply, mocking her as a half-blood’s whore.</p><p align="left">He was sure that deep down, she enjoyed it; not that he cared. However, that wasn’t what she wanted from him. No, she wanted more than their little trysts. He chuckled internally.</p><p align="left">As if her pureblood parents would allow her to marry a half-blood. Even being Salazar’s <em> heir </em> didn’t rectify that little dilemma.</p><p align="left">Good thing he would rather jump in a lake of fiendfyre with his horcruxes than marry her.</p><p align="left">…or marry <em> anyone </em>, for that matter.</p><p align="left">Sex was always the last thing on his mind; merely an afterthought, an outlet for the tension he carried so tightly woven through his person. Dark magic coursed through his body, and it had its own way of invigorating him and at the same time, giving him terrible muscle aches.</p><p align="left">It resembled the irritation and anxiety one experiences when feening for muggle drugs. The dark energy that crackled in his aura pushed him to do more.</p><p align="left">Seek more.</p><p align="left"><em> Be </em> more.</p><p align="left">“All right there, Tom?” </p><p align="left">“Of course, Professor. Never been better.” Tom flicked his wand, effectively banishing the rest of the mess off the table before shoving his yew wand, along with his hands, in his pockets. He had mastered the art of casual charm, which allowed people to feel at ease in his presence at moments that he desperately needed them to be. He also knew how to strike deftly at the proper instant, much like a serpent, instilling terror into his enemies.</p><p align="left">He hoped the professor didn’t notice that in that same wrist movement, he also vanished the elf-made wine to a secure location. He was quite partial to it.</p><p align="left">The professor smiled warmly and held out his hands. “But there, you’ve done the job for me! Thank you, Tom. Ah, and congratulations on making Head Boy, by the way. I always knew you’d be chosen, love seeing a student from my house making headway. <em> As you should</em>. How was your summer, Tom?” He slapped a hand down on Tom’s shoulder congenially.</p><p align="left">Tom’s lips quirked. “It was rather dull and studious, I’m afraid. Not particularly eventful, sir. I spent the last few weeks at Malfoy Manor…”</p><p align="left">Slughorn’s eyes glittered at the mention of the wealthy and ancient wizarding family.</p><p align="left">“... and I was reading up on celestial and elemental magic. Primarily alchemy, sir.”</p><p align="left">Slughorn’s eyes seemed more guarded suddenly. “Do you intend on taking the elective class on alchemy?”</p><p align="left">“I do. I had assumed Dumbledore would be teaching the class, but I’m delighted to hear you’ll be teaching it instead.” </p><p align="left">“Well, I’m equally as delighted to hear you’ll be in the class. It will make it all that more enjoyable. Did you find anything worthwhile in your reading?”</p><p align="left">He schooled his features into a blank mask. “The Malfoys have a rather extensive library. I was reading spellbooks and alchemical research by John Dee, when I happened across the personal journal of Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa. I’ve been fascinated with the German alchemists for quite a while now. I happened across a line regarding the fabric of time.”</p><p align="left">Slughorn’s eyes narrowed and he appeared to be quite preoccupied with picking at the lint on his robes. “Yes, yes, what about it, Tom?”</p><p align="left">“Forgive me, my abilities at translation are a bit poor, but what he seemed to be referencing in his writings was a laceration of some sort. A tear in the fabric of time.” A flash of red shone in his eyes and then disappeared, like a lightning bolt. Slughorn didn’t appear to notice; he was too distracted by the overabundant lint on his grey robes.</p><p align="left">“Hmm, a laceration, yes, I see. Well, these things have been studied but no real data or findings are available. As I’m sure you know, time travel is quite heavily regulated by the ministry, as it can be quite dangerous. The few known instances of any sort of meddling or experimenting with time have resulted in disastrous consequences. Quite the death toll. Are you aware of the case of Eloise Mintumble?”</p><p align="left">“I am, sir.”</p><p align="left">“Poor girl got sent back to 1402! Killed twenty-five people, all descendants. Just went poof, up into smoke. Did irrevocable damage to the timeline. Yes, time travel is a risky business. Very few have attempted it, and for <em> good </em> reason.”</p><p align="left">“Quite right, sir. I sincerely agree. In any case, I do find it a fearfully fascinating subject. His writings mentioned… an object. Called a Tempaestus.”</p><p align="left">Slughorn’s brows drew forward. “What did you say, dear boy?”</p><p align="left">“An object. A Tempaestus. There wasn’t really much of an explanation as to the nature of the object. Contextually, it seemed to be… some sort of enchanted portkey.”</p><p align="left">“I’ll be. I’ve never heard of such a thing. Enchanted to do what, exactly?”</p><p align="left">“I’m regrettably ignorant of the topic, sir. I rather hoped you had the knowledge.” </p><p align="left">“I’m afraid not, my boy.” </p><p align="left">Riddle’s jaw tensed. “I wonder if Dumbledore would know. Perhaps you should ask him. For academic reasons, of course. The object… it’s purpose seemed linked to the ability to draw an individual to a certain geographical location and perhaps, even a precise point in time. Although, a rip in the fabric of time is required to produce such an object… from what I’ve gathered, that is.”</p><p align="left">“To rip open the fabric of time is a dangerous endeavor! That requires dark magic. One could be killed. Permanent damage to the timeline could be done!” He peered down at Tom with a suspicious and fearful glint in his eyes.</p><p align="left">Tom smiled coolly back at him. “We certainly wouldn’t want that, would we, sir?”</p><p align="left">

<em> Four months after Dumbledore’s Death… </em>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“Bella.”</p><p align="left">Bellatrix glided forward, her heels clicking on the marble floor. She bent low before the Dark Lord. “Y-yes, my Lord?”</p><p align="left">“Come with me,” he rasped in his high-pitched drawl.</p><p align="left">“As you wish, my Lord.” Bellatrix followed her Lord down the hallway of the East Wing of Malfoy Manor, into his private chambers.</p><p align="left">He swept across the room, his dark green robes fluttering. She stayed very still, watching as he picked up a small black object from a desk by the fireplace. </p><p align="left">When his crimson eyes turned on her, she grew weak with longing.</p><p align="left">He was not the same Dark Lord that she’d known prior to her stint in Azkaban. He had been much more handsome before the disaster at the Potter’s cottage. His voice had been deeper, slightly more human. His skin, less translucent, without the dark blue veins and rotting teeth.</p><p align="left">But his eyes, they were the same. They had made her shiver then as they did now. And his power, well, it was still unmatched. His magic sometimes wrapped around her like a shadowy cloak.</p><p align="left">Bella had never been more obsessed with him than she was now.</p><p align="left">“Do you know what this is?” he hissed.</p><p align="left">She gazed at the object in his hands. It appeared to be a weathered, rectangular box with a golden latch, about five inches long. </p><p align="left">“I confess, I do not, my Lord. Only if you graciously deign to bestow upon me the knowledge.” Her eyes glinted hungrily, coveting his intimation. </p><p align="left">Lord Voldemort took a deep breath as his spindly fingers caressed the case. “This… is a very valuable object,” he whispered. “It is as important to me, as the cup I entrusted to your care. It has taken me some time to track down its whereabouts. It cannot be reproduced or recreated. It is one of a kind. Do not, under any circumstances, open this case. Do not speak to anyone about this.”</p><p align="left">“It will be as you command, my Lord. I am your humble servant.” Her smile was unhinged. “All… <em> yours </em>.”</p><p align="left">His thin lips turned up in a smirk. “Your family has always served me well throughout the years, Bella.” Then he scowled. “Excepting a few blood-traitors, here and there, among your line.”</p><p align="left">Bella was quick to hedge, “I’ve done away with those I was able to, my Lord. I killed Sirius Black myself.”</p><p align="left">“Yes,” he hissed. “You have been most loyal to hunt down those who have defied me, blood or no. It is why you are my most valuable, most competent servant.”</p><p align="left">She trembled beneath the praise. </p><p align="left">“This object, Bella. It is only to be used in the most dire of circumstances. You know that I am undefeatable. Dumbledore, the old fool, is dead. There is no one left to challenge me. Harry Potter is nothing but a boy, and soon the world will know as much. However,” he drawled. “I read a book once, as a boy, called The Art of War. I don’t imagine you are familiar with it.”</p><p align="left">“No, my Lord.” Her eyes were wide, glistening in rapt attention. He had rarely spoken so candidly with her.</p><p align="left">He gave a rasping chuckle. “Of course not. In any case, a great wizard prepares for every outcome, and this,” he lifted the leather box to her eye level. “This is merely a preparation. Do not be alarmed. My immortality is infallible. There are none in existence who could decipher the depths of my power. I have been quite thorough in my life’s work, however, if all else should fail, for any reason, you are to use this object to return to me.”</p><p align="left">“Return, my Lord?”</p><p align="left">“This tool will allow me to effectively… alter events that have already occurred. In fact, I made a grave error in entrusting this object to the wrong hands years ago. But no matter. I trust that you will see to it that this invaluable possession is kept safe. You are the keeper of time. Keep it safe, Bella.” </p><p align="left">Lord Voldemort hated trusting others with his fate more than anything, but he’d always known women to stay true to certain emotional loyalties, and he knew without a doubt that he had Bella’s unwavering devotion. She had already proven herself much more loyal than Malfoy or Macnair, or any number of his other Death Eaters.</p><p align="left">He grasped her hand and placed the case in her open palm. She quivered at his touch. Then, as a reward for her service, he leaned down and pressed his thin, papery lips to the corner of her mouth briefly. Her eyes fluttered shut and her hand rose to graze the place where his lips had just been. She waited, too rapt to even breathe, as his eyes wandered over her, before he motioned for her to go.</p><p align="left">“I will guard it with my life, my Lord.”</p><p align="left">“See that you do. And Bella,” he called. </p><p align="left">She had wandlessly opened the door, but turned reverently. </p><p align="left">“I will be leaving for Austria on the morrow. Do not tell anyone of my whereabouts. I will be leaving you in charge of operations while I am absent.”</p><p align="left">She dipped her head. “Yes, my Lord… But what will you do in Austria?”</p><p align="left">He had turned his back on her to gaze through the floor to ceiling window, ghostly fingers turning his bone white wand over again and again in his hands. “Nothing to concern yourself with. Simply another preparation. Now, leave me.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left"> </p>

<em> One month after the Battle of Hogwarts… </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Hermione sat in her bedroom, gazing at the photos of her parents on the wall. A month had passed since the Battle of Hogwarts, and she was still hesitant to seek out her parents and restore their memories. She knew it was high time to bring them back to Britain, but she still felt she needed time to readjust. </p><p>It still didn’t feel real. Voldemort was dead.</p><p>Every night she woke in sweats, battling nightmares. She saw their faces. Dolohov. Bellatrix. Greyback. She sensed Nagini stalking her, she could hear its scales dragging along the floor, its heavy girth an immense rope of muscle that could grind her bones to dust.</p><p>Fred. Remus. Tonks. Lavender. All <em> gone </em>. They’d been so permanently disconnected from this world in such a short window of time, that it was surreal. Her head spun.</p><p>Was this PTSD? Perhaps she should see a mind healer. Mrs. Weasley had recommended it.</p><p>Hermione had lived in deafening silence since the battle.</p><p>She was being haunted. Not by the dead, but by Voldemort’s ghost. Somehow, the voice that had so deftly penetrated her mind while she wore the locket horcrux all those months, had never quite left her.</p><p>Dark magic leaves <em> traces </em>.</p><p>He whispered to her at night, playing on her fears, poisoning her with her own regrets. </p><p>If she had only been wiser, cleverer. If she had only resorted to using dark magic, perhaps she could’ve better protected her friends.</p><p>So many lives lost. </p><p>She almost lost Harry.</p><p>She ran quickly to the bathroom and emptied the contents of her stomach into the toilet.</p><p>She was barely eating as it was.</p><p>No, she couldn’t bring her parents back home. Not yet. </p><p>Because she wasn’t quite convinced the world was safe yet, and  because she couldn’t let them see her like this.</p><p>She needed to <em> heal </em> first. They deserved to return to a daughter who was whole. It wouldn’t be fair to make them regret sending her to Hogwarts, to regret allowing her to enter such a dangerous world.</p><p><em> They deserve better </em>, the sinister voice whispered.</p><p>“You’re dead,” she muttered to the air. “<em> Morte </em>. Fuck off.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>The meeting at the ministry had gone better than expected. Draco’s mother was there, and it was confirmed that Draco’s trial was set for sometime next month, and Harry assured her that he intended to testify on his behalf. She had actually <em> hugged </em> Harry, which was unexpected.</p><p>“You saved my life,” Harry said quietly. “You defied Voldemort. You were brave. That deserves my testimony.”</p><p>Narcissa Malfoy had informed the Order that the ministry had completed its inventory of the leftover contents of Bellatrix Lestrange’s vault. All dark objects and instruments were removed and the contents had been bequeathed to her closest living relatives, Narcissa and Draco. Hermione held her breath, not sure if she should reveal that she had taken an object from the vault when they’d broken into it that summer. While Harry had been seeking the horcrux, an object had slid down the pile of treasure and fallen right in front of her. She could sense a strange magic emanating from the object, and when she touched it, it didn’t replicate like the other contents of the vault. That, coupled with the intriguing magic of the enchantments on the object, caused her to scoop it up and shove it into her beaded bag.</p><p>She hadn’t touched it since, but she didn’t want to reveal that it was in her possession, either.</p><p>Narcissa communicated that it was Draco’s intention to use the gold to set up funds for the victim’s families, as well as a hefty donation to Hogwarts for the rebuilding of the castle. </p><p>Well, that certainly would improve his standing in the eyes of the ministry, and his reputation with Britain’s wizarding population as a whole. <em> Not an unwise move on his part, </em> she thought.</p><p>To her surprise, Narcissa had also left an enormous sum in her name, as well as Harry’s and Ron’s. Another large donation went to the joke shop, in Fred’s honor.</p><p>She didn’t want Bellatrix’s money. But it did cross her mind that if she could do some good with it, it would perhaps make her feel a tiny bit better. The vindictive side of Hermione wanted to spend the dead woman’s gold on something to aid the cause of muggleborns. Perhaps even start her own foundation.</p><p>Guilt, it was a strange thing. She was familiar with it, despite being on the right side of it all.</p><p>She couldn’t imagine what Draco must be experiencing in the aftermath of it all.</p><p>Darius Eldridge, a ministry treasury official, questioned her on whether the funds should be added to her Gringott’s vault, or distributed to her person. </p><p>She was able, with some difficulty, to fit all the chests into her beaded bag.</p><p>After her experience with the goblins and Gringotts in general, she opted to keep her galleons and personal belongings close. She was quite unimpressed by the security measures at Gringotts, as well as their mistreatment of the dragon and other creatures in the depths of the bank. Another issue that would need reform, when the time came.</p><p>She would be rid of the gold soon enough; she just had to decide what course of action to take with it.</p><p>When all matters of business and every round of questioning had been concluded, Hermione stood to leave.<br/>
<br/>
“Mione,” Ron called. “Wait up, yeah?”</p><p>She stiffened, but couldn’t comprehend why. “Hello, Ronald.” Her smile was timid.</p><p>His face grew red. “Right, it’s good to see you. Haven’t seen you around the Burrow lately, but everybody misses you there.”</p><p>She nodded, chagrined. “I know. And I miss everyone terribly. I’ve just been… sorting things out. At home, you know.”</p><p>She felt so many things that needed to be said between them, but words failed her. Everything felt flat, numb. Tainted.</p><p>“Right,” he said, a sad lilt to his voice. “You want to head to The Leaky Cauldron with us? Ginny will be there.” Harry was now walking over to stand awkwardly nearby, attempting to allow them their privacy. </p><p>“Oh, I don’t know, Ron…” She couldn’t think of a reason not to go, but the thought of going filled her with apprehension.</p><p>“C’mon, Hermione. We’re your friends.” He gave her an understanding smile. “It’s good for you. It’s good for all of us. We need to stay together.”</p><p>She smiled. He was right, after all. His use of the word “friends” put her at ease. </p><p>She wasn’t ready to broach the topic of “us” with him.</p><p>So much had happened, and Hermione hadn’t yet fully processed any of the grief or the emotions. In fact, she had barely just begun to. </p><p>While she was on the run with Harry, passing the locket back and forth between them, she used to imagine what the world would feel like when it was all over. If they succeeded in killing Voldemort, and the Death Eaters were disbanded, imprisoned, or forced into hiding, what would that feel like? She used to imagine it would feel like relief, like warmth and sunshine had finally broken forth into her life. She imagined how happy she would be to finally have peace. </p><p>Certain visions had kept Voldemort’s voice from taking over at night. A cottage on the outskirts of the city, with a little garden and a library. Ron, finally confessing his feelings to her. The two of them holding hands in front of a crackling fire. Finally being able to take her NEWTS. Would she become an auror? A researcher? A philanthropist? </p><p>Now she, Harry, and Ron were war heroes. Any path she decided to take would be wide open to her. Ron was patiently waiting for her to overcome her fear. They had <em> won </em>. Voldemort was gone. </p><p>So why did she still feel his shadow looming over her life?</p><p>She felt anger. Rage.</p><p>She didn’t want a little cottage or a garden. Not anymore.</p><p>She wanted to learn. To study. To duel. To <em> fight </em>.</p><p>She wanted to ensure that no other dark wizard could ever destroy her world ever again.</p><p>She wanted to prevent other young muggleborns from being tortured and killed. She wanted to change the culture. She felt her protective nature rising up, but the darkness of it frightened her.</p><p>Her girlhood crush, dreams of her and Ron, it was all right within reach and yet felt so far away now.</p><p>Should she become an auror? Should she teach at Hogwarts? How could she make a difference?</p><p><em> If you were stronger </em>, the voice whispered. </p><p><em> Fuck off </em>, she thought back.</p><p><em> To defeat dark wizards, you must think like a dark wizard </em>, it breathed.</p><p><em> We defeated you </em>, she snapped back internally.</p><p>The voice fell silent.</p><p>For the time being.</p><p>“Sure, Ron,” she exhaled. “That would be great. Let’s go.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Hermione sat across from Harry and Ginny at The Leaky Cauldron. Ron sat beside her, his bicep brushing against hers gently. Hermione felt it was on purpose.</p><p>It was late. They had all imbibed more than a fair share of Butterbeer and Firewhiskey and the alcohol had seemed to lessen the tension. Their camaraderie almost felt as it had before the war. Almost.</p><p>“So you’re planning to help with the joke shop, then?” she asked Ron.</p><p>“Yeah,” he muttered, glancing at her. “I thought it was the best way to honor Fred’s memory. And I know George won’t be able to manage without me. I think… I think it will be good for me. I know I always said I wanted to be an auror, but… I think I’ve had enough of chasing dark wizards and death eaters to last me awhile.”</p><p>She nodded, understanding. She couldn’t really relate, as the war had only sharpened her taste for hunting down evil wizards, but she recognized that Ron was going through his <em> own </em> process. </p><p>“I think I might want to be an auror,” she said hesitantly. Harry looked at her with surprise, but also with excitement. “Of course, I plan to go back to school and take my NEWTS.”</p><p>Harry laughed. “Voldemort didn’t know what he had coming when he stood between Hermione and her NEWTS.”</p><p>They all laughed. Then it was quiet.</p><p>Harry spoke up. “I was surprised by Draco and Narcissa today.”</p><p>Ron scoffed, rolling his eyes. “Please. They’re only adjusting to the shift of power. They’ll be political and social pariahs if they don’t do something to ‘right their wrongs.’ All they care about is how they’ll look to the public.”</p><p>Harry shook his head. “I know. It’s true. But still, they didn’t have to do it. Maybe if we believe people can change, and leave room for it, others will follow suit.”</p><p>Hermione nodded, her eyes glistening. “I do want to believe we can create a better world for the next group of witches and wizards. I think you’re right Harry. It’s time to let go of prejudices and believe the best of people.”</p><p>“<em> Believing </em> won’t cause people to change, though,” Ron said bitterly.</p><p>“It doesn’t mean we have to trust them, Ron,” Harry replied. “But the right thing to do would be to reach across the divide. Extend an olive branch, so to speak. For the benefit of all wizardkind.”</p><p>Hermione smiled. “You talk like someone who could run for Minister one day.” Hermione knew that Harry possessed all of the leadership qualities necessary to do the job, and do it well. In that moment, all of the turmoil subsided, and she was simply proud of her best friend.</p><p>“Be what’s expected, wouldn’t it? The Chosen One, running for Minister.” There was a bite in Ron’s tone.</p><p>Harry ignored Ron’s acidic comment, quirking an eyebrow at Hermione. “I think we all know that if any of us could become Minister for Magic, it would you, Hermione.”</p><p>She blushed. “Oh, bollocks.”</p><p>Ginny broke in excitedly. “What are you going to do with the money, Hermione? A bit gratifying isn’t it, knowing you can spend all of Bellatrix’s gold?”</p><p>“Oh.” Hermione. shook her head. “I don’t know. Probably set up a foundation or something. Perhaps, something to help muggleborns acclimate to our world, or pursue house-elf legislation. I haven’t quite thought about it. I’m just as shocked as you by the whole thing.”</p><p>They didn’t talk about the war, or the battle, or Voldemort.</p><p>“I miss Dumbledore,” Harry said quietly.</p><p>Hermione and Ron said nothing. </p><p>She had, in fact, been thinking about Dumbledore quite a bit. He had been the most powerful wizard alive for many years, next to Voldemort himself. He had struck fear into the hearts of dark wizards and death eaters. Who would replace him?</p><p><em> It could be you </em>, the voice whispered.</p><p>‘You’re right,’ she thought. ‘It could be me. I could become a powerful <em> light </em> witch, and destroy wizards like you.’</p><p>The voice said nothing.</p><p>“Harry… do you recall those months of wearing the locket?” She waited until he nodded. </p><p>“I know we haven’t er, spoken of this before, but… Do you still hear it? The voice?” She looked a bit sheepish.</p><p>Harry seemed surprised. “I- Well… No. I haven’t. Not since we destroyed it.”</p><p>“Oh.” She deflated visibly. Ron and Harry appeared concerned.</p><p>“Do you? Still hear it?” asked Ron.</p><p>She swallowed thickly. “Er- only sometimes. It’s not a big deal, really. I suppose it's all in my head. Perhaps I should follow your mum’s advice and see a mind healer.”</p><p>The boys nodded, seeming a slight bit worried, but they hid it well.</p><p>When the night was over, Harry saw Ginny off through the floo. As Ron and Hermione stood by waiting, an older woman approached them. Her dark grey hair fell in ringlets of varying silver hues, and her eyes were a light seafoam green. She stood staring at Hermione for a few moments, observing her with glazed over eyes until Ron began to shift nervously.</p><p>“Can I help you?” Hermione asked politely.</p><p>The woman seemed to be broken out of deep thought, and when she spoke, her french accent was heavy. “I- forgive me, but… z’ere’s <em> something </em> in your aura that drew me to you. I fear fate is weighing heavily on you zis cycle.”</p><p>Hermione’s eyes narrowed suspiciously. She had the awful feeling that this woman was a charlatan. Many <em> supposed </em> seers had a certain line they would use to approach passersby, attempting to draw them into a paid reading. Still, many of those fake psychics were found skulking around Knockturn Alley, and weren’t welcome at these types of establishments. </p><p>The woman was dressed quite expensively, Hermione noted with surprise, with rich velvet robes and exquisite jewelry, appearing to be quite affluent. That, also, could be a part of a ruse.</p><p>“I’m sorry, you’ll have to forgive me, but I don’t believe in fate, <em> nor </em> the barbaric practice of divination.” Hermione tried her best not to seem haughty, but she couldn’t help herself from sounding snide. Divination, after all, was complete bollocks.</p><p>“Yes, but <em> fate </em> , it seems, believes in <em> you, </em>my dear.”</p><p>“Rubbish.” Hermione had had enough. Her temper flared brightly, heating her cheeks.</p><p>The woman gave an eerie smile, her green eyes lit with viridian flames. Hermione’s mouth, which had been pursed indignantly, suddenly fell open. At that moment, she <em> swore </em> she saw a face reflected in the woman’s eyes. It was not hers or Ron’s, and it caused a shiver to crawl up her spine.</p><p>“Who are you?” Hermione asked, brow furrowed. Unbidden, her skin began to prickle, brushed by what felt like the light touch of fingertips, but she recognized it as an unfamiliar brand of magic.</p><p>The woman smiled softly, her eyes still transfixed upon Hermione’s.</p><p>“My name is Madame Violette. I am, as you’ve guessed, a seer. Ze stars led me here tonight, but for what purpose, I could not see. But perhaps… Your aura is pulling me to you, child. Would you permit me to examine your cards?”</p><p>Hermione looked at her in absolute horror. Ron glanced from her to the woman, and then back. “My <em> what </em>?”</p><p>The woman smiled again, and pulled a deck of tarot cards from her robes. “No charge. You have peaked my curiosity. I feel zat zis moment in time is significant. I feel zat… I may have <em> known </em> you, child. Perhaps, in another life.”</p><p>Hermione’s lip curled in disgust, but she quickly schooled her features back into prim dislike. She preferred facts, books, equations, and<em> proven </em> theories. All this vague prattle about <em> intuition </em> and past lives really set her teeth on edge. In any case, something about the woman made Hermione curious. If anything, she would like to prove the woman a complete fraud. She exhaled impatiently. “Oh, all right. But I haven’t got long.” </p><p>She sat across from Madame Violette at a nearby table as she began to shuffle the cards. Ron stood by awkwardly, as did Harry, having already seen Ginny off. Ron whispered to Harry, ostensibly explaining the proceedings, and Harry fixed Hermione with an unreadable expression.</p><p>The woman indicated that Hermione should shuffle them as well. She did as the woman instructed, then rolled her eyes as she placed the deck back on the table.</p><p>“Draw your first card,” the woman instructed as she withdrew an eyeglass and lifted it to her right eye, squinting. The woman’s jeweled rings sparkled in the low light of the pub.</p><p>Hermione slid a card off the deck and handed it to the woman. She placed it in the center of the table. </p><p>The card bore the image of a woman standing, appearing forlorn. “Ze five of cups. Zis card represents your current state of being. It represents sadness, loss, loneliness, and despair. It indicates much regret.”</p><p>Hermione’s jaw tensed and she lifted her chin, avoiding the eyes of her two best friends. She quickly selected another card, eager to move on.</p><p>“Zis card represents your recent past. You have drawn ze five of swords,” she waved at the card, a drawing of a man with a sword gazing over a battlefield. Turbulent dark clouds filled the skies. “Zis card symbolizes a battle in which z’ere are no true winners. It can indicate self-sabotage, failure, aggression, and violence. Its reversal indicates moving on, or ze desire for change.” The woman appeared pensive. “Please, draw your next card.”</p><p>The third card depicted a man standing among many wooden wands. </p><p>“<em>Très</em> <em>intéressant</em>. The nine of wands. My dear, you are someone who has undergone many trials, but through determination and will, you were able to overcome them. This card represents your broader past.”</p><p>Hermione glanced at the woman. So far, despite her adverse feelings toward divination, the cards weren’t too far off base. It was all rubbish, of course, but she had more of an interest in Madame Violette herself, than the cards. She drew a fourth card. </p><p>Madame Violette’s brows drew forth sharply. The card she had drawn was the Death card. She had a flashback of Professor Trelawney’s class, and imagined herself mocking her discernment of <em> The Grim </em>. “Zis card represents what challenges you. It does not necessarily represent death itself, so much as it indicates change, or ze ending of a cycle, and ze beginning of something new. It seems you are resistant to zis change. You fight against it.”</p><p>Hermione huffed, ready for this to be over. She reached for the pile. “Next card, please.”</p><p>Madame Violette eyed her surreptitiously. “For zis next reading you will choose <em> trois </em> cards.” She held up three fingers.</p><p>Hermione hurriedly flipped three cards onto the table. </p><p>The woman’s face flickered with alarm for a flash, but Hermione caught it. After a few moments, the woman spoke. “Zeez cards represent your near future. First, we have ze Tower... You will soon experience a violent upheaval, and unexpected change… Even, possibly, chaos and destruction.” The woman looked quite disconcerted. “Next, we have ze five of wands. Z’ere will be conflict, and competition in your future. You’ve also drawn ze five of swords. Zis symbolizes unbridled ambition, and ze desire to win at all costs, by any means necessary.”</p><p>Hermione was now somewhat invested, despite herself. She knew enough about tarot to know that drawing The Tower was concerning at best. The card glared at her, lightning striking the tower fearsomely. Hadn’t chaos already happened to her? Hadn’t her life already been violently upturned many times over? Brows furrowed, she drew her next card. She flicked her eyes to Madame Violette’s, and briefly caught a hint of the strange face again in the reflection. Again, it was not her own face, but the image disappeared too quickly for her to make it out.</p><p>“Zis card represents how you see yourself. Ze ten of wands represents burden. You take on much responsibility and ‘ardship, in a self-sacrificing way. Please, draw two more cards.”</p><p>Hermione agreed that she did take on a lot of responsibility. Perhaps, <em> too </em> much at times. She flipped two more cards. </p><p>“Zeez cards represent how others see you. The ace of swords represents intellect and mental sharpness. You’ve also drawn ze strength card, which stands for bravery and compassion. Draw two more cards.”</p><p>Hermione was beginning to feel dizzy under this onslaught. Everything Madame Violette read in the cards was surprisingly accurate thus far, although she was hesitant to admit it. She flipped the next two cards.</p><p>“Zeez cards represent your hopes and fears. Ze’ trois of cups… you long for community, friendship, and happiness, but you also fear being stifled, or forced to conform to ze’ standards of others. Of course, here is ze’ six of wands. You desire success, recognition, reward, and victory, but fear disgrace, disloyalty, and treachery. In essence, you fear to trust others.”</p><p>Hermione’s heart was beating rather swiftly. It felt as though her inner turmoils were all being laid out on a table for dissection. She swallowed, willing this reading to be finished as soon as possible.</p><p>Madame Violette watched her with ghostly green eyes, and her perusal made Hermione shift uncomfortably in her seat. “Now, my dear, we will draw ze’ final three cards. Choose carefully, but leave z’em facing down.”</p><p>Hermione began to sweat without warning. <em> Foolishness </em> , she chastised herself. <em> Utter stupidity, this is. There’s nothing to fear from a bloody deck of cards. These cards could apply to anyone. </em></p><p>Her hands shook as she slid three cards from the pile in succession. She laid them face downward on the table. Madame Violette took the first between her long, dark nails. “Zeez three cards represent your distant future. Ze’ order with which you have drawn each card, represents a phase of a journey. Z’is card represents ze onset.” She flipped the first card to reveal the image of two skeletons, intertwined in each other’s arms. “You have drawn ze’ <em> lovers </em>. Z’is represents a relationship, a temptation, or a choice to make between possible lovers.”</p><p>It took all of Hermione’s will to divert her gaze from Ron. Her cheeks turned bright pink as the older woman flipped the next card. “Mon dieu! You’ve drawn ze two of cups. Z’is symbolizes indecision, not knowing which path or choice to take. A conflicted heart. Even... confusion. But even more than that, cherie… The combination of ze lovers and ze two of cups more often than not indicates… soulmates.” </p><p>Hermione was sure her face was beet red at this point. “Soulmates? How absurd. Soulmates do not exist. They’re… but they’re a fairytale!”</p><p>The woman did not smile. “I’m afraid not, <em> cherie </em>. Your soulmate carries a connection between your human soul and your own magical core. For a witch or a wizard, the soulmate is a deep magical bond. Not every magical being will find z’ere soulmate. However, when two halves of a soul reunite, zey are, in essence, reborn through the other’s magic. Made complete.”</p><p>Madame Violette flipped the last card. A bell tinkled somewhere afar off, indicating the pub was about to close. Hermione looked at the card. </p><p>The woman’s eyebrow lifted sharply. “Judgement. This card symbolizes the end of a period of time in your life, and the beginning of a dynamic new era, often characterized by re-evaluating our beliefs, ourselves, our morals. It represents renewal, transition, even reincarnation. Essentially, a complete metamorphosis into our higher self.”</p><p>Hermione set her jaw when looking back at the woman. “So, <em> Madame </em> Violette, what is you <em> expert </em> opinion? Hmm?”</p><p>The older woman’s face was guarded. “Well, I will admit zat I have never seen zis combination of cards drawn altogether. Particularly, zeez three.” She pointed to the last three cards drawn. The Lovers, the two of cups, and Judgement. “But if I may interpret, based on my depth of knowledge, and what my guide is telling me…”</p><p>Hermione swallowed, eyes narrowing. <em> Guides </em> and <em> expertise </em> in divination, <em> please </em> ! Still, her heart beat swiftly in the presence of this older witch. Something told her that this woman was no fraud. In fact, aside from this divination <em> nonsense </em>, she felt that the woman may be an immensely powerful witch.</p><p>The woman continued, “I foresee you will meet someone. I believe it is someone z’at you know, but not someone you are close to. Z’is person… they are an enemy. The cards speak of much conflict in your future. The path is obscure and treacherous.”</p><p>Hermione’s brows drew forth sharply. “An enemy?” She allowed herself to make eye contact with both Ron and Harry. They looked shocked and slightly disgusted. Ron’s face was red with barely concealed rage.</p><p>The witch nodded. “Your feelings for z’is person will lead to much confusion and conflict. However… in the end, you will be re-born from the ashes of such a love.” She smiled warmly. “Z’ere is a swedish proverb… ‘Love is the fire of life. It either consumes, or it purifies.’ Will you let it purify you, Hermione? Or, will you be consumed?”</p><p>Hermione stared at her in shock, trying to recall if she had ever given this witch her name. Madame Violette’s eyes twinkled, but before Hermione had a chance to speak, the woman vanished into thin air, without the resounding crack of apparition. </p><p>“Whoah,” Ron belted out. “What the bloody hell was that?”</p><p>Hermione was dumbstruck, pinned to her chair. “I- Did you hear me- But of <em> course </em>, I didn’t tell her my name, did I?”</p><p>Ron shook his head. </p><p>‘How perfectly odd!” Hermione exclaimed.</p><p>Ron looked around suspiciously. “Do you suppose she’s still here somewhere?”</p><p>Harry shook his head, glancing at Hermione in shock. “No, I don’t… I don’t think she ever was here.”</p><p>“What do you mean, mate?” </p><p>Harry shook his head.</p><p>“I think it’s time to go,” said Hermione uncomfortably. Against her better judgement, she collected the cards the woman had left behind, determining to study the implications of the reading at length, because despite divination being a frightfully wooly discipline, Hermione was nothing if not thorough. <em> Besides </em> , she thought, <em> I have been wrong before. Not often, but it has happened a time or two. We must account for that variable in every circumstance. </em></p><p>She said goodbye to Ron and Harry, leaving them behind, staring at one another in bemusement as she apparated away. </p><p> </p><p> </p>

</p><p> </p><p>Tom opened his eyes.</p><p>It took a moment for those black eyes, irises flecked with crimson, to adjust to the darkness of his flat. He’d had a similar dream for the tenth night in a row.</p><p>It was always the same, but always different.</p><p>Ten nights ago, he had created the Tempaestus and ripped open the fabric of time with an ancient ritual dating back to the Babylonian Magi. When the tear occurred, he saw lightning and shadow and flame, he felt the disturbance in the continuum and the terrifying gravity of ages past. He felt the ground beneath his feet groan and a terrible rumbling, and then… a <em> voice </em>.</p><p>A girl’s laughter.</p><p>It was warm and high-pitched, but it held the promise of conflict. It <em> mocked </em> him.</p><p>What strange dimension had he touched on to create the instrument?</p><p>He had rooted himself in his time with a powerful grounding spell, and then sealed the tear inside the object itself with a rather difficult incantation. Performing that ritual was one of the few times he had feared he would royally <em> fuck up </em>.</p><p>But for all its difficulty, he seemed to have cast the spell correctly. The object glowed blue when he commanded the enchantment to reveal itself, and the gold insignia was revealed with a quick wandless casting of <em> aparecium </em>.</p><p>It was a dark, sacred thrill that few others would ever experience in life. He was pleased with himself for daring to push the boundaries of his magic so far. </p><p>Until he began to have these ominous dreams.</p><p>This night, his dream had been quite strange. He’d seen a beautiful white swan, floating on the swells of a wind-blown lake. Then, a green snake slithering across the top of the water toward the swan, poised to strike. </p><p>Then… that <em> voice </em>. Arresting laughter came from the mouth of the swan, and then it swallowed the snake whole. </p><p>He’d realized too late that he was the snake.</p><p>It alarmed him more than he cared to admit.</p><p>Every night, the dream was different.</p><p>Yet every night, the voice was the same. The tinkling laughter haunted him.</p><p>He closed his eyes as he laid his head back on his pillow, the teasing voice still ringing in his head torturously.</p><p><br/>

</p><p> </p><p>Hermione was tearing her hair out. She’d combed ten different tomes on divination. She’d exhausted her own barely touched books on Divination: Unfogging the Future, Xylomancy, The Predictions of Tycho Dodonus, Death Omens, and Broken Balls. She’d found nothing useful regarding the art of Tarot, soulmate magic, nor the specific reading she had gotten. She had also sent several owls to her french contacts inquiring about a Madame Violette, and unfortunately, no one had any knowledge or acquaintance with such a witch.</p><p>Quite frustrated at this point, she apparated to Diagon Alley and made her way to Flourish and Blotts. She missed this place terribly, and it reminded her that she would soon be shopping for supplies for her final year at Hogwarts, where she would <em> finally </em> be able to take her NEWTS. After a good hour of perusing the shelves, she left with an armful of books, including <em> Divination for Dunces </em> , <em> Tarot Tips and Tricks </em> , <em> A Seers Guide to Second Sight </em> , <em> Perfecting Prophecy </em> , and <em> Wilmina Hargrove’s Handbook for Psychics, Mediums, and Seers.  </em></p><p>For the following week, she holed herself up in her parent’s study, cross-referencing every book in her possession. By the end of the week, she had a tidy little bundle of notes, listing each card, it’s every possible meaning and interpretation, and the potential relational symbolisms between the clusters of cards. She also learned, to her surprise, that the spread Madame Violette had employed to read her cards was an unknown pattern. There were no known spreads like it, which Hermione found frustrating. </p><p><em> Alright </em> , she thought. <em> No big deal. I already know that tarot readings are complete rubbish. No surprise there. Worst comes to worst, I appear to have a monumental crisis in my near future. Smashing. Then, some sort of competition or rivalry, whatever that means. Love. Confusion. Indecision. An enemy who becomes my soulmate, apparently. No big deal. </em></p><p>She thought of Ron. Madame Violette had said her <em> supposed </em> future lover was someone she’d known, but not been close to. An <em> enemy </em>, for Merlin’s sake.</p><p>The only person she counted as a true enemy, besides dead-and-rotting-in-a-black-corner-of-hell Voldemort himself, was Draco Malfoy.</p><p>He did appear to be making efforts to change.</p><p>But did she really consider him an enemy? Well, she certainly had in the past. Certainly. He had tried to <em> kill </em> Albus Dumbledore…</p><p>He was also a former Death Eater. He still bore remnants of the Dark Mark. </p><p>But did she see Draco that way? No. Absolutely not. Her brows furrowed and she chewed her nails in thought. She had considered him somewhat handsome, despite her intense dislike of him as a person. But how much stock was she willing to put into these predictions? She had always professed herself to be a skeptic of divination.</p><p>But she was also characteristically an overthinker…</p><p>No. She would simply not entertain this dreary psychic prediction. If the witch did, in fact, possess any kind of real psychic gift, then the reading would happen on its own, without needing any help or analysis on her part.</p><p>She snapped her book shut, feeling much better about everything.</p><p>She spent the rest of the afternoon being decidedly productive. She checked in with her contact in Australia, who assured her that her parents were well. She’d decided that until each and every Death Eater sympathizer who’d disappeared into hiding were caught, she would leave her parents be. They’d been set up with their own practice (she hadn’t been sure how long the war would last) and she knew they were happy and safe. Hopefully it wouldn’t take the Department of Magical Law Enforcement long to round up the last offenders. By then, hopefully, she would be better acclimated to the new post-war reality. She may even have finished her NEWTS!</p>

</p><p>
<em> Harry was dead. She couldn’t believe it. He lay lifeless in Hagrid’s arms. The tangible feeling of dread and fear engulfed the resistance soldiers around her.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> She stared and stared at Harry’s body. Death Eaters jeered at them, laughing. She met Bellatrix’s unhinged leer, her lip curling in disgust as Bella’s maniacal laugh filled the air. Voldemort held up his hand, waving them into silence. Antonin Dolohov gazed at her with narrowed eyes, then threw her a wink. She nearly vomited. </em>
</p><p>
<em> The dead lay all around, scattered throughout the courtyard.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Ron began yelling and hurling curses at Voldemort. The others followed. Professor McGonnagal wept only feet away from Hermione.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Her eyes left Harry’s body for the first time. Voldemort was staring at her, his pupils mere slits, red eyes glowing like some demon from her worst childhood nightmares. Their eyes connected, and though she expected bile to rise up in her throat, she felt something else. Fear? Yes. Immeasurable fear.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> But there was something else. Was it compassion? Was it familiarity? </em>
</p><p>
<em> Voldemort crossed the courtyard, his bone white wand held high. He sped toward her at alarming speed; was he flying? He seemed to be floating. He gripped her arm and she pulled away, fighting, but his strength was unmatched, his wraith-like body empowered by the dark magic bolstering his fractured soul. </em>
</p><p>
<em> He yanked her against him; he smelled like death. “No!” She yelled. “Let me go! Coward!” </em>
</p><p>
<em> He laughed, a high-pitched, rasping sound. It crawled over her skin like a thousand tiny slithering serpents. She struggled against his bruising grasp to no avail.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Let her go!” shouted Ron. “That’s my girlfriend!” </em>
</p><p>
<em> Voldemort’s laugh was beginning to morph into something else, darker, deeper. A smooth, gravelly chuckle. He leaned closer, pulling her against him until his barely there lips were against her ear. “The weasel claims you’re his, but we both know better, don’t we?” </em>
</p><p><em> The faint scent of Amortentia engulfed Hermione in a swathe of intoxicating feelings. It drew her toward Voldemort. “What are you doing to me?” she asked, alarmed. “Let me go. </em> <b> <em>Harry</em> </b> <em> !!!” </em></p><p>
<em> “Harry won’t save you.” His voice was definitely deeper, with an enchanting cadence to it. “Come to me, Hermione.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> She shook her head, tears forming. “How could you?” she whispered in distress. “How could you?” She whispered it over and over, gazing up at Voldemort’s frightening features, as if she didn’t recognize the horrifying face before her.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Together, you and I,” he breathed, voice dark and ethereal now, as if she’d heard it in an old movie. “We will do great and terrible things, Hermione.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> She shook her head again, pushing against his chest with her hand, which now felt warm and hard and real under her palm, rather than thin, cold, and skeletal. “No! Let me go! HARRY!!”</em>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Hermione sat up with a scream, chest heaving as she struggled to take in breath. She shuddered, her skin crawling with the after effects of the dream. Her eyes darted around frantically, as if to ensure her that she was indeed, in her home, safe and alone. </p><p><em> He’s here </em> , she thought. <em> I can feel him </em>.</p><p>But the voice that had plagued her for the past month was silent.</p><p>What sort of monstrous creature was Voldemort, that he was able to haunt her even after being destroyed so many times over? </p><p>A sob built in her chest, rising to the surface to spill from her throat in a guttural cry. Her fingers threaded through her hair, threatening to tear it from her scalp. </p><p>She couldn’t shake the image of Harry lying in Hagrid’s arms.</p><p>“He wasn’t dead, Mione. Everything worked out, in the end. We won. That’s what matters,” Ron had said to her once, after the Battle.</p><p>But what if he had died? What if everything <em> didn’t </em> work out? So many people had died right before her eyes. What if one of them had been Harry?</p><p>She felt the cold grip of Voldemort’s bony fingers on her arm still. To her horror, she looked down at her arm and saw the blooming of light purple marks wrapping around her skin in the beginnings of a bruise.</p><p>Like fingers...</p><p>Her eyes widened and her breath halted. For the second time since they’d broken into Gringotts, she thought of the object she’d stolen from Bellatrix Lestrange’s vault. </p><p>She’s felt the presence of dark magic surrounding it when it fell down the pile of treasure and landed right in front of her… as if it had come to her. When she’d touched it, it hadn’t replicated like the other contents of the vault. It couldn’t be a horcrux… that would be impossible. </p><p>But it reeked of <em> him </em>.</p><p>She knew the frequency of his magical signatures from the amount of time she’d spent carrying his horcrux.</p><p>Was that object the reason for the voice she couldn’t shake? Was it responsible for her nightmares?</p><p>She felt the sting of self-loathing. She’d kept it, when she should have turned it into the ministry. It was potentially a very dangerous object. </p><p>But somewhere, in the shadowy recesses of her mind, she’d wanted to keep it. Why? As a memento? Something to remind her of the brave acts she’d undertaken to defeat the most powerful dark wizard of the century? Or perhaps, some very sick and twisted part of her admired Voldemort’s power. She had not admitted it to anyone, but despite his sick and disturbing ideologies and lack of human feeling and remorse, he was still capable of such feats of power and magic that she’d <em> never </em> heard of <em> any </em> wizard being able to master. </p><p>It’s <em> dark </em> magic, she reminded herself. It corrupts the wielder.</p><p>And that was just it, wasn’t it? Voldemort had destroyed himself. Once, he’d merely been a boy. An orphan. Handsome and charming, according to Harry. The Voldemort she had encountered at the Battle was just an example of the product of dark magic and how irreversibly it can alter an individual’s mind and soul.</p><p>He had split his soul multiple times through murder and horrifying ritualistic magic. He had tortured people she loved. Killed them. He’d been absolutely mad, in the end.</p><p>She shivered, remembering the dream. It disturbed her deeply. It was almost as if he had <em> known </em> her.</p><p>Perhaps she had better rid herself of the object. </p><p>But first, she wanted to discover its secrets.</p><p><em> For academia’s sake, of course </em>, she told herself.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p align="center"><em> 10:14pm, </em>   <b>August 28, 1998</b>  <br/>

</p><p>Hermione smoothed her hands down her red dress as she walked back into her childhood home. The hour was late, and she’d just returned from the Burrow where the Weasleys had thrown her an early birthday party. She would be leaving for Hogwarts in just two days, the only one of her trio of friends who would be attending their final year, so they’d opted to throw her 19th birthday party early.</p><p>She ran her fingertips absently over the thin gold chain around her neck, the dainty phoenix charm cold against her skin. It had been Ron’s birthday gift to her, and she could still feel his fingers against her skin where he’d clasped it around her neck. </p><p>“To remind you that good always wins, Hermione.” He’d muttered in her ear, low enough so the others couldn’t hear. “Don’t forget, yeah? Don’t let the memories drown you.”</p><p>It was the most attentive and thoughtful thing Ron had ever done for her. He was really making a valiant effort despite years of dancing around her, and Hermione gave a wry look to herself in the mirror as she stroked the necklace. She was aware that her friends were worried about her. The war had done a number on all of them, but she was faring the worst of them all.</p><p>Curse her overactive mind.</p><p><em> But good doesn’t always win, does it, Hermione? </em>The voice taunted her.</p><p>It had crossed her mind many times since the Battle that they’d been incredibly lucky. Everything <em> had </em> worked out against almost impossible odds… that seemed to point to some kind of interference by fate, or some higher power, didn’t it? Perhaps light <em> did </em> triumph over dark…</p><p>But her analytical and skeptical mind couldn’t help but think they’d simply been lucky. She didn’t believe in fate.</p><p>She couldn’t allow herself or her loved ones ever to be vulnerable again. </p><p>She wanted to be <em> powerful </em> . She wanted dark wizards like Voldemort, like the vile and disgusting Antonin Dolohov to <em> fear </em> her.</p><p>There was a dark side to Hermione, a vindictive side that she’d warred with all her life. But now, in the aftermath of the war, it festered.</p><p>Her dream haunted her. Voldemort’s voice, so deep and different than it had been in her memories, whispering… </p><p>
<em> We will do great and terrible things together, Hermione. </em>
</p><p>Why was she having these dreams? Why was she still hearing the voice of the horcrux? It had ceased speaking after Ron destroyed the locket, just as it had done for Harry. Why was she hearing it again?</p><p>It simply had to be coming from the object she had stolen from Bellatrix’s vault. </p><p>She should have turned it into the ministry months ago.</p><p>She <em> would </em> , of course. Turn it in. But if she handed it over now, she would never discover <em> what </em> exactly it was, the kind of peculiar magic it contained. Voldemort may have been a raving, murderous lunatic, but his magical ability was also unsurpassed, and she was hesitant to throw away the opportunity to study a piece of magic that she may never again encounter in her lifetime.</p><p>She made her way into her bedroom and took her beaded bag off her wrist. She had used a shrinking charm to attach it to her bracelet like a charm. She engorged it and reached inside, digging around for a few minutes before she finally felt the leather case against her palm.</p><p>She took it out and set it on her bed. She reshrunk her bag and reattached it to her wrist as she gazed at the object. This was the first time she had touched it since the day they’d broken into Gringotts. Ever since, she’d felt it calling to her, always aware of its presence in her bag. She’d almost come to savor its presence, her own dark little secret. </p><p>“That’s <em> not </em> a good sign, Hermione,” she admonished herself. In the back of her mind, she knew it could contain potentially very dangerous magic, particularly to someone who wasn’t aware of its properties.</p><p>If Dumbledore were still alive, she could trust him to examine the object with her.</p><p>She no longer trusted the Ministry. Did she really want to work for or confide in a governmental body with such a horrendously awful track record? She was still torn.</p><p>Gingerly, as if she expected it to turn into a snake and bite her, she ran her fingers over the aged black leather. </p><p>She gasped. At her touch, a glowing, golden inscription began to materialize on the surface of the leather. There were runes magically etched into the lid of the box, and then below the runes, the letters “T.M.R.”</p><p>Her heart began to beat very swiftly. This confirmed what she feared.</p><p><em> Tom Marvolo Riddle </em>.</p><p>But why would he use those initials? From what she had been told, he hated his given name, as it reminded him of his muggle roots and the father who abandoned him.</p><p>Unless…</p><p>This object could have belonged to his father?</p><p>“That’s entirely possible,” she muttered to herself, reverting back to her childhood habit of talking to herself aloud. </p><p>She examined the runes. Some were recognizable, as she’d studied ancient runes in depth for years, but others looked positively primeval, like some archaic kind of cuneiform.</p><p>“That doesn’t bode well at all,” she whispered. </p><p>She recognized one of the runes as <em> Eihwaz </em>, whose practical meaning was “yew” but which also represented eternal life.</p><p><em> Immortality </em>.</p><p><em> How typical of Voldemort, </em>she thought with a wry smile. The man really did have a one-track mind. She secretly prayed this item didn’t somehow pull him back from the afterlife.</p><p><em> There is no bringing back the dead</em>, she reminded herself. <em> Even the resurrection stone couldn’t do that. I’m safe. </em></p><p>She waved her wand, muttering detection spells. There appeared to be no dark curses upon the object, save an obscure enchantment that radiated with a bright, incandescent blue glow. Aside from that, she could decipher nothing about the magic housed within it.</p><p>She flicked the golden latch and opened the box, revealing a tiny scroll and an antique black and gold fountain pen, perched on a bed of velvet. </p><p>“How odd,” she whispered reverently. She felt Voldemort’s sinister magical signature upon the item, but it was rather light and unobtrusive, nothing like the hypnotic dark energy that imbued his horcruxes.</p><p><em> That’s because there’s not a jagged piece of his soul attached to it,</em> she thought with a shiver.</p><p>She knew Voldemort to be suspicious and overcautious, so she cast detection spells over the contents of the box, just to be safe. </p><p>Finally, curiosity got the better of her. She carefully picked up the miniature scroll and unrolled it. The parchment was blank.</p><p>She tapped her wand to the scroll. “Revelio.”</p><p>Nothing appeared. Hermione frowned deeply.</p><p>She tapped the parchment again. “Aparecium.”</p><p>After a moment, something began to take form, spidery black letters sprawling across the parchment. In spiky letters, the word “invictus” was penned. Beneath the word (<em> or spell? </em>) was a rough sketch of the dark mark. </p><p> </p><p>
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/1ZCKdRs/Invictus.png" alt />
</p><p> </p><p>Hermione swallowed. This was, in all likelihood, written and drawn by Voldemort himself. She stared at the letters, willing them to give her some insight into the nature of the spell, its purpose, or Voldemort’s intent in writing it.</p><p>Her eyes wandered to the pen, laying in the case as a skeleton would rest in a coffin. Did he write it with this pen? </p><p>Why did the word <em> invictus </em> sound so familiar to her? She recognized it to be Latin, but it had a familiar ring to it… as if she’d heard it before, but couldn’t recall where.</p><p>She went to her bookcase and pulled out her spellbook. Over the past two months, she had exhaustively organized and compiled all known spells into a kind of reference book. She’d enchanted it to be indexed and easily searchable by spell or keywords. Truthfully, if she were to create an official prototype and then reproduce it, she could likely make quite a bit of coin. It was ever so useful, and she was surprised no other witch or wizard created anything similar to it yet.</p><p>She tapped her wand to the open book and commanded it to search by muttering, “Invictus reperio.”</p><p>The pages glowed and flipped by in rapid succession before the book slammed shut, indicating that there was no such spell. Curious.</p><p>A bit apprehensively, she searched her Latin dictionary.<br/>
<br/>
</p><p><b>invictus</b>  /inˈu̯ik.tus/, [ɪnˈu̯ɪkt̪ʊs̠]</p><ol>
<li>unconquered, unsubdued</li>
<li>invincible, undisputed, undefeated<br/>
<br/>
</li>
</ol><p>
<em> Unconquerable.  </em>
</p><p>She grinned. Voldemort was an arrogant sod, wasn’t he? To think himself invincible and yet still be defeated by three teenagers.</p><p>Her mind ran through all of the possible uses of this spell.</p><p>It <em>could</em> potentially brand her with the dark mark. That would be awful. But yet, she knew the Dark Mark had utilized a variation of the Protean charm, so she doubted that was the case.</p><p>Could it summon someone? Perhaps it was a kind of necromancy?</p><p>That would explain why she was having strange dreams and hearing voices.</p><p>She picked up the pen. It seemed rather harmless, truthfully. Against her better judgement, she plucked a blank sheet of paper out of her parent's printer. She had to know if the pen was enchanted to respond to her as his journal had been.</p><p>She wrote her name, and to her surprise, the ink in the antique pen was still flowing freely. An inkpen of this type should have dried up by now.</p><p>Nothing happened.</p><p>She was beginning to think the pen must have held some sort of sentimental value to Tom Riddle. <em> It probably isn’t even a spell, </em> she thought. The scroll was likely some doodle of his, a prototype of the dark mark scribbled absentmindedly as he studied for an exam. She chuckled under her breath, imagining a youthful Voldemort, drawing skulls, snakes, and anagrams in his spare parchment during study time.</p><p>Just your regular mundane, teenage, murderous, psychopathic hobbies.</p><p>She gripped the pen, having one more inspired thought prior to abandoning the endeavor completely.</p><p>She scrawled the word <em> invictus </em> across the copier paper with the pen, then sat back and yawned deeply. It had been a long day, and it was well after midnight now. She might as well get some sleep. She had to finish packing for Hogwarts tomorrow, after all. She waved her wand, casting a quick charm to dim the lights.</p><p>Just as she was preparing to return the pen to the case, she caught sight of her messy, hastily scratched handwriting as it suddenly disappeared from the thin sheet of paper.</p><p>Her eyes widened. </p><p>Where had it gone? </p><p>After several moments, the word shone across the paper in a bright blue glow, the same color as the enchantment on the case.</p><p>Then it disappeared again.</p><p>Her brow furrowed, watching with rapt attention as her heart thundered rapidly in her chest.</p><p>
<em>What had she done?</em>
</p><p>Then, she was sucked out of her chair by a what felt like a giant vacuum. She heard a loud <em> WHOOSH </em>and the loud crack of thunder, and then her bedroom faded, to be replaced by nothing but greyness and shadow.</p><p>There was wind all around her, whipping her clothes and tearing at her hair. Everything appeared blurry and hazy, obscured behind a murky veil of darkness.</p><p>“Where am I?” she shouted, but her voice was muffled as if she were speaking through a box fan. “Help!”</p><p>But there was nothing but shadow. She tried to move, to run, but she was suspended in midair, on an alternate plane where the laws of gravity were nonexistent. </p><p>Fear suddenly gripped her. What if she was trapped here? What if she had been lured and ensnared into the object, like a genie in a lamp?</p><p>She had no idea how long she had been there but she felt that hours had gone by, in this purgatory. She screamed and yelled until her voice was hoarse, to no avail. </p><p>Not even Voldemort’s voice spoke to her here.</p><p>Hermione bent her head between her knees as the winds tore at her red dress and her bare skin, and she wept. </p><p>The tears that fell were as desolate as the plane of existence in which she was caught; she seemed to be purging out the poison of the war, siphoning out the toxic emotions that had built up in her system. The tears were black at first as they slid down her cheeks, marring her smooth skin until they at last ran clear, and she wondered if she was indeed hallucinating. After several hours, she fell into a deep sleep.<br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p>When Hermione awoke, nothing had changed. She watched as the shadows around her shifted from black, to gray, to light, and then back to black. She heard voices, laughter, cries. There were sounds of construction, of cars, of gunshots. The din was all around but also echoed from far away. </p><p>Hermione was on the verge of hyperventilating. She instructed herself to breathe deeply so as not to panic. She <em> definitely </em>should have seen a mind healer like Mrs. Weasley suggested.</p><p>Was she going insane? She shook her head, truly embarrassed at her actions. She, <em>the brightest witch of her age</em>, had stupidly walked into a trap. She had acted entirely uncharacteristic of herself. Old Hermione would have turned the object over to the ministry <em>immediately</em>. Old Hermione <em>never</em> would have frivolously toyed with a dark object created by Voldemort himself. How <em>stupid</em> could she be, really? This new reckless version of herself was surely going to get her killed.</p><p>Perhaps she was simply in a subconscious state of mind, and someone would find her body soon, and hopefully wake her up. Yes, that must be the case. Ron or Harry would come for her. She began casting spells, attempting to break whatever curse she was under.</p><p>She recalled the card Madame Violette had drawn: the tower. Chaos and violent upheaval. That sounded pretty poignant right about now, huh? </p><p>Hours passed as she cast every spell and counter-curse she could think of. Nothing succeeded. She thanked whatever gods existed that she had her wand, although it didn't seem to be helping her much at the moment.</p><p>She tried to make out the voices and sounds, but they weren’t clear enough. She even thought she perceived figures walking toward her, but their forms were unstable and wraith-like.</p><p>The wind was the worst part. It was harsh and unforgiving, pricking her skin like a thousand tiny needles. She was cold, so painfully cold. She had cast countless warming charms until her magic began to weaken. </p><p>Hours passed in a blur. Nausea set in. She was hungry. Hermione pulled her beaded bag from her wrist and upon inspection, she was grateful to find she had packed some of the food and cake from the birthday party that Mrs. Weasley had insisted she bring home. </p><p>“You oughtn’t to be staying there all by your lonesome, Hermione,” Molly admonished. “It’s not safe! Have you even been eating? By the gods, you’re so thin these days! Take some birthday cake, treacle tart, and a big slice of my meat pie. I won’t take no for an answer!”</p><p>She’d cast a stasis charm on it and placed it carefully in her bag. She couldn’t be more grateful for it now.</p><p><em> Not that it matters, </em> Hermione mourned to herself. <em> If I’m really trapped here, I’ll starve eventually. </em></p><p>She hunched over the food as best she could, shielding it from the wind as she ate. Once she was sufficiently stuffed, she pulled a vial of dreamless sleep potion from her bag and downed it. Within seconds, she faded into blackness.</p><p>At some point during her slumber, she felt the roughness of gravel grinding against her skin, but in the amorphous arms of dreamless sleep, she barely felt a thing.</p>

<p align="center">
<strong>Chapter 5: Riddle House</strong>
</p><p align="center">February 3, 1948</p><p> </p><p>Hermione woke on a cozy little sofa in a small, dim sitting room. The room was modest, but there were quaint touches here and there that made it feel like a home. The only light in the room shone from a tall glass floor lamp. </p><p>She looked around her, quite disoriented, but pleased to no longer be trapped in that terrifying shadowy plane, which was either a real place or a prison of the mind. In any case, she was exhausted, though she suspected she’d been sleeping for days, and her tongue was parched and dry.</p><p>On one side of the room sat a bare wood table and two chairs. A little brick fireplace crackled in front of her, keeping her toasty and warm. There was a frosty bite in the air, which alarmed her greatly, as it was currently only August and should be quite warm. Who would light their fireplace in August?</p><p>She rose slowly, realizing her body was quite sore and her legs felt like jelly. As she stood, she was hit with a wave of nausea which forced her to sit back down quickly in order to allow it to pass.</p><p>Something was off… But where was she? That blasted pen had set her back days, locking her up inside some kind of mental torture chamber. She was <em> supposed </em> to be at <em> Hogwarts </em> right now!</p><p>Now thoroughly irritated with herself and by extension, her surroundings, she stood despite the weakness in her limbs and walked to the window, peering outside. It looked to be evening, but she had no earthly idea where she was.</p><p>Through the dingy glass of the window, she could see a stone path that led to the front door of the cottage she was staying in, and beyond that, a small but lovely garden leading up to the back end of a large, three-story stone house. The house was strange and eerie, and vines crept up all along the stone.</p><p><em> Wherever I am </em> , thought Hermione, <em> I don't want to be here longer than necessary. </em></p><p>Soon, she caught sight of a man making his way to the cottage. She reached in her pocket and immediately sighed with relief when she felt her wand slide into her grip. She double-checked that her beaded bag also remained shrunken and hooked as a charm on her silver bracelet. Thank <em> heavens </em>.</p><p>She backed away and stood behind the door as the man approached. The door opened and he shuffled in, dragging his feet across the tiny mat. He looked around his mid-thirties and appeared to be confused when he looked to the small sofa, no doubt wondering where she had got off to.</p><p>“I don’t mean to alarm you-” Hermione began, and the man jumped a foot in the air. </p><p>“Jesus, Mary, and Joseph! Now what are ya doin’ hidin’ back there?”</p><p>Her brows furrowed as she looked at the man. He took off his scarf and hung his coat on a small hook by the door.</p><p>“Um, sorry… but where am I?”</p><p>He glanced at her as if she’d lost a few marbles. “Forgive me, miss, but I found you lyin’ on the gravel out there about six-thirty yesterday evening. Looked a bit beat up and right out of sorts. I couldn’t rouse ya for nothing, but the nearest hospital be in Little Whinging, it’s quite a far way to go, as you know.”</p><p>“No, I- I don’t know, I’m not from here. Little Whinging, you said?”</p><p>“Aye. Closest hospital, but still not quite close enough.”</p><p>“So… er… where am I now? Where is here?”</p><p>"Why, you're in Little Hangleton." He gave her a questioning look. “You don’t know? Don’t you know how you ended up here at all?”</p><p>She looked apologetic. “Not exactly.”</p><p>He shook his head, rubbing his hands over his eyes. “I swear to God, I’ve got ta get away from this bloody house. Too many strange things ‘appening here lately.”</p><p>Her heart began to beat swiftly, her pulse jumping. “Who are you, sir?”</p><p>He seemed to have remembered himself. “Oh my, but I’ve forgotten my manners.” He held out his hand to her, and she took it hesitantly. “My name is Frank, miss.”</p><p>Her eyebrows drew forward. “Whose house is this?”</p><p>“Well,” he shook his head. “Used to belong to the Riddles, before they all… passed.” </p><p>Her blood ran cold. <em> Breathe </em> , Hermione. <em> Just breathe. </em></p><p>“So this… house is…”</p><p>“Well, this be the cottage. I’m technically the gardener. Name’s Frank Bryce, miss. But the big house on the grounds outside is called Riddle House. It’s empty now.”</p><p>She nodded slowly, willing herself to be calm. “So there’s no one else… around? No one lives here, it’s just you?”</p><p>He nodded. “Yes, miss. The Riddles haven’t lived here in a few years now.”</p><p>The enchantment had brought her to Tom Riddle’s father’s house. The manor home where he <em> murdered </em> his father and grandparents.</p><p>Was it some kind of portkey? </p><p>She barely remembered the story that Harry had told her. She did, <em>however</em>, recall him mentioning a gardener named Frank. The man had seen Tom Riddle walking toward the house the night he killed them. Poor Frank had been blamed for the murders, too.</p><p>She also knew that Frank was murdered by Voldemort in the summer before fourth year. Harry had seen it through the connection to Voldemort’s mind.</p><p>But that meant... if <em>this was </em>Frank, and he was still alive…</p><p>She swallowed despite her throat being parched. “Frank, when you say ‘they haven’t lived here in a few years,’ how many years exactly do you mean?”</p><p>He appeared to be thinking. “Well, I s’pose it would have been… about four or five years now.”</p><p>She nodded slowly, barely able to breathe. She spoke in a very polite tone so as not to betray her shaking voice, “Right. Well. Sir, I must be going. I’ll be needing to contact my family. Thank you very much for your hospitality and all your help. You’ve been very kind.”</p><p>He nodded, a look somewhat like sadness, or resignation on his face. “I didn’t do it, you know.”</p><p>Her brows furrowed. “Excuse me?”</p><p>He sighed and sat down in a chair at the table. “You seem afraid of me, but I didn’t do it. I didn’t kill the Riddles. I just… wanted to say that.”</p><p>Hermione was stunned. He thought she was leaving so suddenly because of fear of <em> him </em>. </p><p>Not even remotely.</p><p>“I know you didn’t, Frank.” She felt a wave of compassion for the man.</p><p>He ran his hand over his face wearily. “Thank you. Ah… Are you sure you’re well enough to leave? Do you need anything before you go? You’re not quite dressed for the weather out there.” He gestured to her red dress and bare legs.</p><p>She shook her head. She needed to leave soon; she could feel herself going into shock. “No, no I’m fine. Thank you.” She started to leave but then turned back. “Only… You never saw me here, Frank. If anyone asks… I was never here.”</p><p>His brows drew together. “There’s never anyone coming through here no ways, but all right, I won’t tell a soul.”</p><p>She took a step forward earnestly. “Thank you. Frank… You should leave. You should get away from this place. Go find someplace else peaceful. Anywhere else.”</p><p>He stared at her with pensive eyes for several moments, then nodded as if he understood. </p><p>Hermione turned and left the little cottage. She had to find today's paper <em>immediately</em>. She needed to determine whether or not she was hallucinating. She walked down the stone path, passed by the cold, stone manor with its creeping vines and sinister memories, and apparated away.</p><p>

</p><p> </p><p><br/>It was as she feared. The pen had not put her in a mental prison; instead, it had sent her to a different time.</p><p>Hermione stood on the sidewalk in front of the lot where her parent’s home should be, but alas, a dilapidated old factory sat there instead.</p><p>At some point, this factory would be torn down and her parent’s home would be built.</p><p>Hermione shivered in the icy bite of the wind. Her nose was numb and red, but the shock she was experiencing chilled her deeper than the cold. Passersby gave her strange looks, but she took no notice.</p><p>Her parents didn’t exist in this world.</p><p>With a choked sob, she apparated away.<br/><br/></p><hr/><p> </p><p>She chose to go to the place she felt safest.</p><p>She would have simply gotten a room at a muggle hotel so that she could try to get her bearings, but she realized her parent’s bank cards wouldn’t work in this time period. Bank cards didn't even <em>exist</em>.</p><p>Diagon Alley was much the same. There were a few scattered witches and wizards lining the streets, but not nearly as many as there usually were in August before the start of school at Hogwarts. That was perhaps due to the frigid weather, and she thanked her lucky stars for that. The fewer people who saw her in her current state, the better.</p><p>She’d already garnered several gawking looks from a few bystanders, and she did realize how utterly ridiculous she looked, freezing her tits and toes off in a sleeveless a-line dress and strappy red heels, which were entirely inappropriate for this time, not to mention for this time of year.</p><p><em> Well, </em> she thought rationally. <em> I’m here now. So, first things first. </em> She bit back her rising nausea as she ducked into an alleyway and unhooked her beaded bag from her wrist. She engorged it to its proper size with a wave of her wand and reached inside, searching for the bag of galleons she’d withdrawn from Gringotts for her school shopping. She also searched her bag for her warm crimson cloak, but discovered with quite some dismay that it still hung on the hook in her parent’s foyer.</p><p><em> Ratsl I’d better purchase some proper clothing, </em> she thought. <em> The goal is to fit in, not stand out. I don’t need to draw any more attention to myself than necessary. </em></p><p>With one particular goal in mind, Hermione steeled herself and made her way to Madam Malkins.</p><p>The fashion of wizarding robes in this time was quite different. She did have some extra sets of her own in her beaded bag, but the robes themselves and the clothing underneath were so different, that she realized she would stick out like a sore thumb were she to wear her old ones.</p><p>The shopkeeper eyed her with curiosity and astonishment as she shopped in her little red dress; still, she kept her remarks to herself and Hermione thanked her lucky stars again for small mercies.</p><p>The items cost her quite a few galleons, but she was pleased to find that her money stretched much farther in this time than it had in the future. She walked out of the shop with a pair of charmed chameleon skin gloves, stylish heeled and laced dragonhide boots, and three sets of fashionable dress robes in rose red, deep evergreen, and powder blue. She’d come across a magnificent cloak - silver with elaborate cream embroidery and trimmed with cruelty-free (transfigured) jackalope fur. It was quite an indulgent purchase but Hermione was feeling rather stressed and not at all immune to the stereotypical “retail therapy.” She felt much better when she walked out of the shop wearing the powder blue robes and her warm fur cloak.</p><p>She wandered up and down the street, observing the changes that had taken place in Diagon Alley throughout the years. She passed a newspaper stand and purchased a copy of The Daily Prophet, which solidly confirmed her suspicions. The date of the issue read <em>February 3, 1948</em>.</p><p>A frightening thought occurred to Hermione. She’d been so overwhelmed by this little adventure that she hadn’t even fully let herself contemplate it. </p><p>
<em>Voldemort was still alive in this time. </em>
</p><p>She racked her brain… 1948… He would have finished school at Hogwarts and would now likely be working at his job at Borgin and Burkes.</p><p>He might even be working there <em>now</em>.</p><p>She gazed down the street, her eyes connecting with the little sign that pointed to “Knockturn Alley”.</p><p>She had to get back to her time. <em> Immediately</em>. </p><p>There simply <em>had </em>to be a way.</p><p><em> Well, </em> she thought resignedly, <em> there’s no use panicking. I’m here for now. I’ll have to find a place to think, study, and properly determine the logical next course of action.  </em></p><p>“Then,” Hermione announced cheerily to herself. “I know I can find a solution. I <em> always </em> have.”</p><p>She stood on the street, her brilliant mind whizzing and whirring like a golden snitch in flight, until her stomach growled loudly.</p><p><em>I could do with some food, </em>she thought<em>, and a hot bath.</em> She had only just realized it had been days since she’d bathed. She’d cast <em>scourgify</em> on herself prior to entering Madam Malkin’s but it couldn’t really mimic the pleasantness of a nice long soak.</p><p>After all, she would need a place to stay while she figured out what to do about this mess she’d gotten herself into.</p><p>It was getting quite late now, and most of the shops had closed for the evening. Hermione made her way to the northern side of Diagon Alley and turned onto a little side street, praying that the quaint inn was still open now as it was in the future. </p><p>To her relief, it was still there, although the name had clearly changed since the 1940s. At this time, it was called Esther’s Eclectic Bed and Breakfast, but Hermione could care less what it was called, as long as she could have some nosh, a nice warm bath, and a good night’s rest. </p><p>Hermione paid for a three night stay and checked in under the name Hermione Jean (she would have to determine what name to use in this time, but that required extra time and thought) and then paid an additional few sickles to have some soup and gillywater brought up to her room. </p><p>Once she was alone, she tossed her (now much lighter) bag of galleons on the desk, then fell face-first onto the bed and began to sob her misery into the coverlet.</p><p>What <em> had </em> she been thinking? What in <em> bloody hell </em> had gotten into her?</p><p>Hermione knew much better than to toy with an object that was clearly saturated with the magical signatures of the evilest, most murderous dark wizard of the century.</p><p>She groaned into the pillow, feeling both frustrated and truthfully, quite drained. </p><p>Her parents were still safely tucked away in Australia… that was a comforting thought. At least, they wouldn’t miss her.</p><p>She thought of Ron and Harry. They would notice her absence soon. Wouldn't they? Or had she permanently altered the timeline simply by traveling back so far in the past? She had only ever traveled mere hours before with the time turner in her third year… But never so far back that she should never have even been <em>born</em>. To the best of her knowledge, that wasn’t even magically possible. There had only been one case of someone traveling back that far, and it hadn’t ended well. Not only was time travel extremely dangerous, but it was illegal. It was practically suicide.</p><p>And yet, here she was, all in one piece… for the time being at least.</p><p>How had he done it? How had Voldemort accomplished such a feat when the world’s most powerful and knowledgeable wizards had declared it impossible? She felt a pang of irritation. He really had been an irritating fucking wanker. Even dead and rotting, he was <em>still </em>a thorn in her side. And now she was <em>here</em>, in <em>his </em>time, feeling as though she could never truly escape him. He haunted her past, her dreams, her thoughts, and now her present, once again.</p><p>She reached into her beaded bag and withdrew the fountain pen. This kind of magic defied logic. It was impossible, and yet he’d done it. Why hadn’t he ever used such an object? Or perhaps he had, and no one had been the wiser? Had he already used such an object to alter the timeline in his favor?</p><p>Another question begged to be answered… Why had Bellatrix Lestrange been in possession of it?</p><p>Her head pounded, mind brimming with questions.</p><p>Worst case scenario, Hermione feared she would never be able to return to her time. </p><p>Her thoughts sped along.</p><p><em> Well </em>… not quite. The worst case scenario would be getting discovered and chucked away in Azkaban for time traveling, despite it being unintentional on her part.</p><p>Her mind continued to reel.</p><p><em> Actually… </em> the absolute <em>worst </em>case would be trying to get back to her time and incidentally being ripped to shreds by the time/space continuum. <em> Or </em>going <em>completely </em>mad like some other time travelers had.</p><p>For that reason, even if she could find a way back, it would require every drop of resolve and bravery she possessed just to <em>attempt </em>it.</p><p><em> But what if </em>… what if the only way to get back to her time was to seek out Voldemort himself? What if he was the only one who held the answers to her questions? What if he alone knew how to reverse the enchantment?</p><p>Hermione sighed, throwing an arm over her eyes. She was overthinking again.</p><p><em> Don’t panic. Don’t give up, </em> she commanded herself. <em> Somewhere, somehow, there is a solution to this problem. </em></p><p>“Alright,” she muttered to herself. “Everyone you know hasn’t even been born yet. You’ll have to just become someone new. You need a story, a past. <em> Think </em>, Hermione.”</p><p>Any other witch or wizard might absolutely, unequivocally, monumentally <em>lose their shit </em>in this situation. But she was <em> Hermione Granger</em>. Muggleborn war hero. Bank-robber extraordinaire. Dragon-rider. Horcrux destroyer. The brightest witch of her age.</p><p>“Wait!” she practically shouted. “There is someone I know who is alive during this time. Why didn’t I already think of it?”</p><p><em> Dumbledore</em>. If anyone would believe her and potentially have a way to help her, it would be him.</p><p>She felt a tiny spark of hope. She would owl Dumbledore in the morning!</p><p>With her plan set, she ran a hot bath and poured in her favorite bath oils that she’d managed to locate while rummaging through the contents of her bag. She would need to do inventory and discover what useful items she might have brought with her from her time.</p><p>The lavender, vanilla, and sandalwood vapor rose around her as she soaked her aching muscles and put her mind at ease. It was her signature scent and always reminded her just who she was and how powerful she had become. She dipped her head beneath the surface of the water, submerging her hair fully as she shampooed its length. The hot water permeated her muscles, which had been chilled to the bone by the frigid cold outside.</p><p><em> I can do this</em>, she thought. <em> If I can’t find a way back, then I’ll make a difference here. I can alter the course of the future for good. I can even save lives if I’m cunning enough. </em></p><p><em> I could kill Voldemort, </em>she thought deviously. It gave her a wicked amount of satisfaction to know that she would have an advantage over him at this time. The vengeful side of Hermione’s nature started to bloom under this line of thought.</p><p>But first, she needed to think about what she would say to her old headmaster.</p><p>Her heart beat swiftly at the thought of seeing Dumbledore. She’d assumed she would never see him again after his death in sixth year. What would she say to him, now? She couldn’t say much, truthfully. To give him too much knowledge of the future could be dangerous.</p><p>Despite feeling slightly abandoned by him, even somewhat used… she had missed him terribly. She had to admit that despite the careless way he had handled their lives in the war… she loved him. He represented everything that she aspired to be. An imperfect man, but an incredible wizard. One of the most powerful to have ever walked the earth.</p><p>Tears threatened to spill as she climbed out of the bathwater, casting a drying spell before she donned the soft robe supplied by the inn. She fell into bed with her hair still wet and tried to remember everything she could about the era in which she found herself. Important dates, notable names, and significant events circulated through her mind until she finally succumbed to sleep."<br/><br/></p><hr/><p> </p><p>The next morning, she woke bright and early and donned her red robes. The silk bodice of the dress was pleasantly fitted and fastened with attractive little loops. She slipped on her fashionable dragon-hide boots and examined her appearance in the antique mirror. She cast a charm over her hair that Ginny Weasley had taught her. It was a newly invented charm, as Ginny had been creating a line of beauty products to sell in the Joke shop. It instantly tamed her frizzy hair into smooth curls that cascaded down her back. She certainly could’ve used such a charm earlier in life for her unruly locks, but was terribly grateful for it now, all the same. She ran a tube of velvety red lipstick over her lips and felt that she quite looked the part of a fashionable witch in the 1940s. She ran her fingers over the gold phoenix pendant, wondering how Ron would take her absence. She thought back to the nightmare she’d had several nights ago…</p><p>“Let her go! That’s my girlfriend!” Ron had shouted.</p><p><em> Was </em> she his girlfriend? No, she didn’t think so. Certainly not now, at least. She’d left their relationship status ambiguous, which truly was no different than it had <em> always </em>been, and she decided that, in retrospect, this for the best. The Hermione who had pined after Ron Weasley was not only a different person than the Hermione who stood looking at her in the mirror now, but she was also a Hermione from an entirely different time.</p><p>Who was this Hermione who stood before her? Perhaps with the creation of her new identity, she would discover who she had become since the start of the war.</p><p>Hermione crossed the room and sat down at the small wooden desk in the corner of the room. In the drawer she found an old quill and ink and a few spare bits of parchment, so she set to work writing her letter to Dumbledore.</p><p>
<em> Dear Headmaster, </em>
</p><p>
<em> I am writing this letter to request an audience with you. You do not know me, but I know you. Please grant me this interview, as such a meeting is of the utmost importance. The fate of the wizarding world hangs in the balance. Forgive me for being vague, but it is by necessity, although I am aware that cryptic talk is your area of expertise, and you do it much better than I ever could.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> I will assuredly enlighten you as to who I am and what my purpose is in requesting this appointment. I am quite eager to see you again. I desperately need your help, and no doubt, you need mine as well. </em>
</p><p>
<em> I will await your owl. I am staying in Diagon Alley. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Warmly, </em>
</p><p>
<em> Hermione Granger<br/></em>
</p><p>
<em>P.S. You will find your favorite sweets in the attached parcel</em>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>At approximately noon, Hermione donned her fur cloak and took a brisk walk in the cold sunshine to the owlery and posted her letter along with the box of Sherbert Lemons. She then popped by Florean Fortescue’s for a Banana’s Foster Sundae and then visited the library as she awaited Dumbledore’s reply. She read several recent issues of The Daily Prophet as she attempted to gain an understanding of current events, and managed to scan through several books related to time travel.</p><p>She had just finished up with her purchase of a new quill and parchment at Scribbulus Writing Instruments when she walked out into the cobblestone street and collided with a tall gentleman at the intersection of Knockturn Alley.</p><p>“Forgive me, I clearly wasn’t paying attention,” said the young man in a smooth, deep voice. He bent over to pick up the parcel she had dropped.</p><p>‘Oh, thank you,” she muttered breathlessly. “I assure you, I am usually the culprit of these kinds of collisions.”</p><p>The man laughed, flashing dazzling teeth as he stood to hand her the parcel. She was shocked to find that he was quite handsome. Shockingly so, in fact. He wore a crisp white shirt with a black tie and trousers, and dark green, almost black, robes with silver clasps.</p><p>He first gave her a quick appraisal, and his eyes lingered on her as she took it from his hands. “I suppose I should thank my stars for your clumsiness then, Miss…?</p><p>She paused as she looked him over in return. <em> Holy cricket, </em> she thought. <em> I’ve never seen a more attractive person in my life. </em> Black curly hair, pale skin, Slytherin green robes, an irresistible smile, striking black eyes, and, incidentally, emerging from Knockturn Alley… </p><p><em>No</em>, it couldn’t be…</p><p>“Hermione,” she announced cautiously, omitting her surname. “My name is Hermione.”</p><p>His eyes narrowed slightly, cocking his head to the side as he observed her. “Lovely name. To my utter misfortune, I’ve never seen you before.” He extended his hand. “I’m Tom.”</p><p>She stared at his hand as if it were a snake that would bite her. She swallowed once, then her eyes lifted once more to his face as he stared at her in bemusement. </p><p>“Forgive me,” she muttered quietly, her throat suddenly dry. “I- I’m terribly late. I must go.” She sidestepped him deftly and practically ran down the street to get away from him. She braved one glance behind her, and found Tom staring after her, his eyebrows furrowed in contemplation, if not outright confusion.</p><p>She didn’t allow herself to breathe until she was back in her room at the inn. That was <em>not how </em>she had intended her first meeting with the young Lord Voldemort to go.</p><p>Not only had she been caught off guard, but he was so utterly <em>handsome </em>and <em>normal </em>looking.</p><p>Well, not <em>normal</em>, per se. It was not <em>normal</em> for anyone to be that incredibly good-looking.</p><p>Harry had described him as handsome and charming, according to the memories he’d seen in the penseive, but Hermione had always imagined him as some sickeningly beautiful male model type. A typical sort of attractive, but not <em>her </em>type.</p><p>Oh, but he was <em>definitely </em>her type, unfortunately. There was a razor-edge sharpness to his demeanor; a sort of avant-garde quality. He was tall and lean, with beautiful, long-fingered hands. His pale skin had been slightly flushed from the cool air, lending him such a <em> human </em>air. He carried himself with an elegant sophistication that was classically British. She recalled his straight nose, piercing black eyes, and those <em>lips</em>. <em> Merlin have mercy</em>.</p><p>She felt sick. It disturbed her greatly that she found him so charming in that brief interaction, when he was, at his core, incredibly evil and sadistic.</p><p>As Hermione’s heart rate slowed enough that she was finally able to assess the situation, she realized that it was quite the perfect time for her to be here, after all. He hadn’t created all of his horcruxes yet, his political influence was minute, if nonexistent, and he had not yet reached the full potential of his magical ability. Yes, he was a formidable foe, but so was she. </p><p><em> I’ll be your worst nightmare, Tom Riddle, </em> she vowed acidly.</p><p>At that precise moment, she heard a rapping on her window. She turned to find a great gray owl sitting on her windowsill. Her stomach turned with excitement and anticipation as she took the letter from its beak. It bore Dumbledore’s very own wax seal.</p><p>She took a deep breath, broke the seal, and unfolded the parchment.</p><p>
<em> Ms. Granger, </em>
</p><p>
<em> I am delighting in the knowledge that there is yet another such person who shares my affinity for arcane and enigmatic linguistics. I have often thought of myself as a wordsmith, as words are, in my not-so-humble opinion, our most inexhaustible source of magic, after all. </em>
</p><p>
<em> I will be most delighted to make your acquaintance, as my curiosity is now piqued. Security measures shall be taken, mind you, but you are most welcome to meet me this Saturday at ten o’clock in my office on the grounds of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Our gamekeeper shall meet you at the entrance of the castle to escort you. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Please send your response with my owl, Twinkle (he loves citrus tarts, should you happen to have any). </em>
</p><p>
<em> Sincerely, </em>
</p><p>
<em> A.D. </em>
</p><p>Hermione smiled, more than a little emotional at the thought that there was someone here, after all, whom she was familiar with. She quickly wrote a response and sent it off with his owl, Twinkle. She had no citrus tarts, but the nocturnal bird seemed just as happy with one of the sugar quills she’d picked up at Sugarplum’s that afternoon. He ate it rather quickly, and she sent him off with her note.</p>

<h2 class="heading">The First Meeting</h2>
</div>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>At approximately ten o’clock the following morning, Hermione sat before her old headmaster. He was much younger than she remembered him, and he sported a set of pale, periwinkle robes. His auburn hair and beard were flecked with the tiniest amount of gray. The office was also slightly less eccentric than she remembered.</p><p>Hermione met his eyes morosely. If Dumbledore didn't believe her, then there really was no hope for her plight.</p><p>“To what do I owe this pleasure, Miss… Granger, is it?”</p><p>“Yes, Headmaster.”</p><p>“You say Headmaster as if you were a former student of mine.”</p><p>“Well,” she said wryly. “I sort of… was.”</p><p>His brows furrowed, and he looked down his half-moon spectacles at her for a closer inspection.</p><p>She sighed. “I don’t even really know where to start with this conversation, to be honest.”</p><p>“I suppose it would be wise to start at the beginning. That is where most things begin… the beginning.”</p><p>She laughed. Her nerves were getting the best of her, and when faced with the need to put it all into words, the absurdity of it all was disheartening. “Well, it’s all quite unbelievable, but I know if anyone <em> would </em> believe me, it’s you, Headmaster.”</p><p>His eyes were kind. “<em> Do </em> try me, Miss Granger.”</p><p>She nodded, took a deep breath, and began. “Well, sir, I’m a time traveler. I didn’t <em> intend </em> to be, but here I am. I was sent here by an enchanted object belonging to a Dark Lord. I did attend Hogwarts. I was in Gryffindor house. You and I, as well as my friends, were quite close, or so I’d like to believe. I don’t want to say too much, and I don’t know if my presence here will alter the timeline irreversibly or not. I hope that if it does, its for the better.”</p><p>He nodded, thoughtful. “What year is it where you’ve come from?”</p><p>She took a deep breath. “1998, sir.”</p><p>He leaned back in his chair, pensive. “Pray tell, what is the state of our world, in your time?”</p><p>She released her breath in degrees. “Well, sir, I’m afraid to say too much, but… there was war. It has only just ended. There was a dark wizard. My two friends and I, you gave us a mission, and we fulfilled that mission. We helped destroy this dark wizard.” Hermione looked down at her hands. “But I was foolish and impulsive, and… emotional, I suppose, after the war ended. I should have turned the object into the ministry. But I wanted to examine it for its magical properties. And well... Here I am now. I didn’t know the purpose of the object. I never would have chosen to travel back in time… It was purely unintentional.”</p><p>He appeared very concerned. “This wizard must have been very powerful, to have created such an object. I am familiar with the magic of time and space. However, it has only just begun to be studied for all of its possibilities.”</p><p>He leaned forward, folding his hands in front of him upon the desk. “May I ask, Miss Granger, what it is that I can help you with? I’m afraid I do not have the proper knowledge in the way of time traveling magic to help you get back to your own time. But now that you are here… what can I do?”</p><p>She looked positively gobsmacked. “Are you saying you believe me?”</p><p>He tilted his head slightly, observing her. “I do believe you. However, I am going to request evidence, either in the form of consensual legilimency, or perhaps memories to corroborate your claims. I have a penseive. It would be useful to be able to relive some of your memories, in order to determine what we can do with you now that you’re here.”</p><p>She nodded eagerly in acquiescence. “You can give me Veritaserum if necessary, sir. I’ve nothing to hide.”</p><p>He smiled, but then his expression grew grave. “It is terribly dangerous, you being here. Should the Ministry catch wind, you could be subjected to, at best, a rigorous investigation. At worst, perhaps imprisonment.” </p><p>He didn’t say <em> Azkaban </em>. He didn’t have to.</p><p>His eyes were sharp. “Or worse, I fear. To have knowledge of the future is something that could corrupt even the most well-intentioned of wizards.”</p><p>She twisted her lips to the side, chagrined. “That’s what I’m afraid of. I’m not sure what I should do, sir.”</p><p>He leaned back once more, watching her. “You say you’re a Gryffindor?”</p><p>“Yes, sir.”</p><p>“And a war hero, by your own admission.”</p><p>She bobbed her head, a slight blush tinting her cheeks. “Well.. sort of. It certainly doesn’t feel like it, though.”</p><p>He laughed. The sound was familiar, and it caused a lump to rise up in her throat. “I know that feeling well. There’s very little pomp or glamour in defeating dark wizards. It is rather lackluster, I’m afraid, although it does yield flashy headlines.” </p><p>His blue eyes were keen and penetrating as he stared at her. “There, a war hero. Here, a criminal. How strangely the world works, Hermione.”</p><p>She noted his use of her given name. “I will, of course, find my own way here. But I had hoped perhaps you’d have some advice for me.”</p><p>He gazed at her thoughtfully for several minutes. At length, he stood, crossed to a cabinet behind his desk, and withdrew several vials. Then he advanced to stand before her and lifted his wand, which she recognized as the elder wand. </p><p>“Congratulations on defeating Grindelwald, by the way,” she said quietly.</p><p>“Thank you, Miss Granger” he murmured, his eyes meeting hers. There were ghosts in them. “Now. I’m going to extract memories. I will tell you which memories to focus your mental capabilities on. I would use legilimency, however, I’m afraid I would see things that I shouldn’t, things that might drive me mad. This method is more controlled, you see. I will, of course, return them, once they have served their purpose.”</p><p>She nodded, giving him her consent. </p><p>He proceeded to extract many memories. Her Gryffindor sorting, memories of Harry and Ron, her parents and childhood, a few interactions between herself and Dumbledore, a few select memories of the war, her meeting post-war at the ministry, and then, the memory of the time traveling itself. He bottled the memories carefully in the vials, and then enclosed them in the cabinet behind his desk.</p><p>Then he perched on the edge of his desk beside Hermione, appearing very stoic and thoughtful. At length, he spoke.</p><p>“Are you safe, and is there anything you have need of? Where are you staying?”</p><p>Hermione cleared her throat. “I’m staying at an inn, in Diagon Alley. I’m safe, for the time being. I don’t think there’s anything I lack. I’ve kept a low profile; no one knows I’m here.” <em> Except for an extremely handsome shop boy, but that’s not important. </em></p><p>He inclined his head. “Miss Granger, can you give me a day or two? It’s imperative that I examine these memories, and then... I will need to think about what the best course of action will be, for your sake.”</p><p>She attempted to stop the tears from welling up in her warm brown eyes, but she failed miserably. “I’m ever so grateful, Headmaster. I find myself so overwhelmed by my situation. Not only that, but I also feel incredibly alone. To have your help is more than I could have hoped for.” She gestured to the tears falling down her cheeks. “Forgive me. This is <em> quite </em> embarrassing!”</p><p>He chuckled gently as he took an elaborately folded handkerchief from the inner pocket of his pale blue robes. It was etched with his initials. “Two days at most, Hermione. I will have a solution by then. Please, wait for my owl.”</p><p>“Thank you, Headmaster.” Hermione stood, drying her eyes with his kerchief before handing it back to him, and then made to leave.</p><p>“Miss Granger,” he called sternly as he sat at his desk once again.</p><p>She turned and noted a severe expression on his face. </p><p>“Be very careful, until then.”</p><p> </p>

</p><p> </p><p>Albus Dumbledore sat in his office, nursing a splitting headache. For several hours he’d relived, examined, mourned, and poured over the memories the young Granger girl had given him so eagerly. He had not quite trusted her at first, but he’d learned early in life not to show distrust until it had been fully and heartily earned. </p><p>He found himself almost bewitched by the young woman’s trust. In <em> him </em> , no less. He was quite fascinated by the girl’s memories; only mildly so by the events of the future, and much more so by the emotional quality of her memories. This girl had held him in the highest regard, she and her two friends. This wasn’t so abnormal in itself; he was quite used to the celebrity of being a wizard who singlehandedly brought down the dark wizard Grindelwald. By then, it seems, the events of the Global Wizarding War had been overshadowed, and he’d lived to see the rise of yet <em> another </em> dark lord. Would he ever be free of these twisted megalomaniacs? They seemed to be multiplying like rabbits.</p><p>Albus sighed.</p><p>No, the girl didn’t seem to hold him in the same type of esteem as his colleagues. To her, he was not merely a famous duellist or a skilled wizard, but a hero of some sorts. A savior; some sort of symbolic figure of higher morality…</p><p>Goodness, embodied.</p><p>
<em> The Light, incarnate. </em>
</p><p>This frightened him. For he truly thought himself incapable of this kind of leadership. It was the sole reason he’d rejected the role of Minister for Magic, despite countless calls upon him to accept.</p><p>Fear overtook him, causing a thousand tiny goosebumps to raise on his arms. </p><p>He began to sweat as he stood and paced back and forth in his office. </p><p>The girl’s appearance was dangerous, indeed.</p><p>For not only did he have to contend with another threat to the wizarding world at large, a rising dark lord who was already capable of seemingly <em> impossible </em> feats of magic…</p><p>But he held in his hands the fate of this young woman. </p><p>And she held in her thoughts, the <em> future… </em></p><p>A disastrous temptation for Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore.</p><p>She had said she hoped to change the future for the better.</p><p>Such was a temptation too great for Albus to conceive. But how could he live up to this young woman’s standard for him?</p><p>He had always battled some terrible version of himself. Power was his greatest desire, and also, his greatest fear. His <em> weakness </em>. He was not the man this young woman imagined him to be.</p><p>But he desperately wanted to be.</p><p>He had always striven to think of the greater good. To put the world at large above himself and the few people he loved dearly.</p><p>It made him cold at times. It forced him to be rational. </p><p>For some <em> reason </em> only known by his future self, that green-eyed boy named Harry was sentenced to die. It infuriated him, not to know <em> why </em> . Not to <em> see </em> everything.</p><p>Who was this evil wizard? The dark void of ignorance threatened his very sanity.</p><p>And for this girl and her two friends, he felt only grief.</p><p>The grief of Mother Mary, sacrificing her son for the sake of the world.</p><p>Albus breathed heavily as he wiped at the sweat beading on his forehead. </p><p>Was he still alive, out there, in the future? He had not been able to see his fate clearly. Perhaps she had concealed it on purpose.</p><p>He paced, and he paced.</p><p><em> No </em>.</p><p><em> He </em> was not the hero of this story.</p><p>He would leave it to Miss Granger. </p><p>He stared at the vials. This girl had imagined him, unwittingly, as a kind of father figure.</p><p>Albus was disgusted with himself, with his own selfish desire to use her for her knowledge of the future. His own secret weapon. He had thought this from the very moment she opened her mouth.</p><p>But to see the pedestal upon which Hermione Granger had placed him left him feeling ashamed. Unworthy. Filthy.</p><p>Albus suddenly ached with resounding loneliness.</p><p>He felt it crawling up and out of him like a starving creature housed within his chest.</p><p>He collapsed, knees buckling as he sank low into his chair.</p><p>His head split. His chest ached. The weight of the world pressed in on him until he choked on the bile of despair.</p><p>With a wave of his wand, a photo appeared on his desk, which he’d kept hidden from sight for many years.</p><p>He gazed at the more youthful version of himself, his arm linked with a handsome young blonde man. The photo moved, and the two young men smiled at one another, then laughed in tandem as the photo was taken.</p><p>Albus dragged his eyes away from the frame to gaze blankly at the wand in his hand. Then, in a fit of something he would rather not acknowledge, he flung the wand violently across the room. It clattered against his bookshelf and fell to the floor.</p><p>He hung his head between his knees, and tragically, he wept.</p>

<strong><br/>
<br/>
February 7, 1948<br/>
<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>The top floor of the Leaky Cauldron housed a large meeting room. The room was rather dimly lit and gloomy, but its history was legend. This room had been used by many politicians, Ministers, ministry officials, and influential wizards for meetings of the minds.</p><p>Tom chose it for its political significance, as well as its geographical convenience. The outer courtyard led to the entrances for both Diagon and Knockturn Alley, which made it an easy escape for Tom when he needed to leave for his job at Borgin and Burkes.</p><p>He checked his watch. He had approximately forty-six minutes until he would need to end the meeting.</p><p>Twice a month, on a given Saturday, at seven o’clock in the morning, Tom met with his Death Eaters to discuss their social and political strategies. He often used these meetings to gauge their worth and usefulness. He also took the opportunity to fill their heads with the useless tripe they wanted to hear. He was so used to casually manipulating them that it had become like second nature.</p><p>His Death Eaters sat around him now. He glanced around him at the collection of faces. Nott, Malfoy, Mulciber, Rosier, Rookwood, MacNair, Lestrange, Dolohov, Avery...</p><p>They spoke amongst themselves, eating breakfast, drinking tea, and waiting for Tom to call the meeting to order.</p><p>Usually, Tom hated wasting time. He generally kept himself to tight time constraints, but this morning, he was pensive. His mind wandered, drowning out the voices of his colleagues.</p><p>Tom Riddle had been presented with a riddle. </p><p>And the riddle's name was… <em> Hermione </em>. </p><p>He couldn’t shake the encounter he’d had with a young woman in Diagon Alley.</p><p>The girl was pretty, he supposed. Passably pretty, at least.</p><p>She did have smooth skin, fine dark brows, warm eyes, a deliciously trim waist… She certainly wasn’t the most handsome woman he’d ever met. But she was attractive, he could admit. </p><p>However, her meager amount of charm wasn’t the reason he couldn’t get her out of his head.</p><p><em> Fear </em> . He’d seen it in her eyes when he’d introduced himself. She had blatantly <em> refused </em> to take his hand. What had he said to invoke such <em> fear </em> ? He was <em> sure </em> he had never met this girl before. He racked his brain, occluding, flipping through the files of his carefully organized memories to ensure there was no such engagement that he’d forgotten. No, he was sure of it.</p><p><em> Addicting </em>. That’s what it was.</p><p>She’d looked at him with the kind of fear and turmoil that he hoped the entire wizarding world would one day bestow upon him.</p><p>It made him feel immensely <em> powerful </em>.</p><p>He’d had fantasies, imagining that kind of fear in the eyes of his enemies. The thin skin around the eye widening, stretching, pupil contracting, pulse racing… </p><p>He wanted Dumbledore to feel that kind of terror. For <em> Voldemort </em>.</p><p>Intoxicating. Tom fixated on the feeling. He couldn’t help his little <em> fixations </em>. He often gave into them, for with them came a kind of clarity, the ability to see things that others often overlooked, to sense lies and intentions with razor-sharp accuracy, to command an aerial view of a situation. </p><p>He imagined the look in the girl’s eyes, over and over again. He imagined the young woman on her knees before him, her heart pounding in her chest, gazing up at him with those wide, whiskey-brown eyes…</p><p>Tom shifted uncomfortably in his chair. <em> Fuck </em>.</p><p>How infuriating.</p><p>Something about the girl’s reaction appealed to his baser urges.</p><p><em> Hermione </em>.</p><p>Not a common name. It wouldn’t be difficult to find her if she had any ties at all in the wizarding community. </p><p>After all, he had eyes and ears in every corner of magical Britain’s society. </p><p>Who was she? Why did she <em> fear </em> him?</p><p>She’d pointedly avoided giving him her surname. She had made that painfully obvious, which was very unwise on her part. It let him know that she didn’t <em> want </em> him to find her.</p><p><em> Oh, but I will find you, little witch </em>.</p><p>He imagined himself chasing her, and a sinister thrill leaked in his bloodstream at the thought of her running, fleeing, out of breath, a scream building in her chest.</p><p><em> Fear </em> . Of <em> him </em>.</p><p>How utterly delicious.</p><p>He shifted again in his seat, adjusting his tie. </p><p>Tom had at first convinced himself he had imagined it all. He must have misread the situation, her expression… dreaming something to be there that wasn’t.</p><p>But he knew now that he hadn’t. Because he knew <em> fear </em> as if it were his old friend. He’d seen it many times, in many faces.</p><p>He'd kept a mental picture of the terror frozen on his father's face when he died. Despite his father's handsomeness, the expression etched into his cadaverous face was revolting.</p><p>Fear was often grotesque and ugly, a raw and unfiltered emotion. Hideous to behold. </p><p>But <em> Hermione </em> wore it so prettily.</p><p>Tom couldn’t help himself from imagining her naked, with abject terror and loathing, her only accessories.</p><p>He swallowed back his lust, adjusting himself once more.</p><p>“Gentlemen,” he murmured, addressing his followers. Their soft muttering ceased, and their attention turned to him. <em> Fear </em>. He desired more of it.</p><p>And he would <em> have it </em>.</p><p>“Dolohov,” he said, addressing the man at the far end of the table with as much disdain as he could manage. He could manage quite a lot of it. “If you can’t master the spell, don’t bother coming to the next meeting. There are standards here. If you can’t meet them, you are welcome to seek out and join an… assembly of mudbloods, perhaps? Maybe <em> they </em> can teach you the basics of elementary magic.”</p><p>Dolohov sneered at the insult but swallowed his retort. “Yes, my Lord. I will master it.”</p><p>Tom cleared his throat. “What news from the Ministry?”</p><p>Avery and Nott piped up, giving reports on the various new legislations being presented, the formation of new committees and subdivisions being formed, new hires, rumors and whispers of power shifts, etc. </p><p><em> Hermione, hermione, hermione </em>. He saw her frightened face when he blinked.</p><p>Tom clenched his teeth, causing a ripple in the muscles of his sculpted jawline.</p><p>Infuriating.</p><p>He occluded thoughts of her to the farthermost corner of his mind.</p><p>“Wilhemina Tuft has announced her intention to run as Minister of Magic…” Avery droned on.</p><p>“Pureblood… perfect,” Lestrange muttered.</p><p>“Abraxas,” Tom interrupted. The room went silent.</p><p>“Yes, my Lord?” </p><p>“Does your family still host an Ostara celebration at Malfoy Manor?”</p><p>“We have, yes. For the last several years, at least, my Lord. My ostentatious mother will take any opportunity to flaunt, naturally.” There were a few snickers.</p><p>Tom waved them to silence. “You’ll host the event this year. I want a copy of the guest list. There are names that I want to be included. You’ll organize a secret meeting in the drawing room during the event. Every pureblood family in Britain is to be invited.” He tilted his head thoughtfully. “Include the half-bloods, as well, I think.”</p><p>There were scoffs. He turned his penetrating black eyes on the culprits, momentarily allowing the irises to shift to a glowing, deep red. </p><p>The gentlemen lowered their heads. <em> Fear </em>.</p><p>“We must take every opportunity to plant our ideals in the heads of society’s best and brightest. You, my friends, <em> are </em> the most powerful men that Britain’s wizarding community has to offer. I use the present tense, because, with me, your future is already determined. I have braved the boundaries of certain magic that has never yet been explored by even the greatest wizards that exist in these modern times. I have discovered magic that no spell book or school will be able to teach you… because it, as yet, has not been uncovered. Not even Dumbledore knows of the existence of some of the magic <em> I </em> , <em> Lord Voldemort </em> , have uncovered. You all have seen but a <em> taste </em> of this power. With me, yes, you will be generals of the most powerful wizarding army to ever exist. We will challenge the current laws that govern the wizarding world. We will challenge the relations of muggles to wizards. We will upturn every root of fear that we consider to be unlawful or insulting to our kind. Muggles will <em> never </em> rule over wizards. We will not fear them. We will not cater to them. Never again will wizards or witches be burned alive. You, my friends, are revolutionaries. Death Eaters will control every sector of the wizarding world. I am relentless in pursuit of this vision. I, <em> Lord Voldemort </em>, will lead you into this reality.”</p><p>He glanced pointedly at each face. “But… you will have to learn to take orders, and take them blindly, and swiftly. You will have to <em>learn</em> to lay aside your prejudices, if only temporarily. Not <em>all</em> magical blood can be pure. I believe I, myself, am a prime example of this.” His followers shifted uncomfortably, many of them looking at the floor. “Your prejudices make you weak. Complacent. There is strength in numbers… and your pureblood numbers are few. Growing fewer by the decade, it seems. We <em>will </em>enlist the half-bloods. You will all do so without complaint, or you will not relish the consequences.” His eyes flashed red. “While you’ve all been twiddling your thumbs, attending your… <em>posh</em> parties, and fucking your pureblood whores in order to sire more useless heirs for your… <em>little</em> <em>dynasties</em>,” he smirked with caustic amusement. “I’ve been doing what must be done to ensure that our movement is not only successful, but <em>undefeatable</em>. So put <em>that</em>, MacNair, in your earl grey and drink it. Now,” he stood, waving his wand to summon the notes that Rosier had been diligently scribbling. “Be sure to hold your fucking tongues until you bring me something useful. Abraxas, walk with me.”</p><p>At that, he grabbed his cloak and left, taking the precariously narrow staircase to the ground level of The Leaky Cauldron. Abraxas followed him through the back exit, trailing along at his heels. </p><p>Tom saluted the young boy sitting, lonely, behind the bar. “See you, Tom.”</p><p>“Goodbye, Mr. Riddle!”</p><p>Tom and Abraxas walked along in silence through Knockturn Alley, passing leering werewolves and dirty old hags. As they neared Tom’s workplace, he spun on his heels, stopping the young Malfoy in his tracks.</p><p>“I need you to be my eyes and ears, Brax.”</p><p>“Certainly, my Lord. Please, tell me what needs to be done.”</p><p>“You will report back to me any grumblings that reach your ears, sparing no one, so that I may deal with it. We cannot have dissent amongst our ranks. I will make an example of anyone who defies my orders.”</p><p>Abraxas nodded stoically. “It will be done, my Lord. Have I not been your most trustworthy friend all these years?”</p><p>It was true. Abraxas was possibly the only one of his original knights that he harbored any level of fondness for. </p><p>Tom trusted no one, as a rule. But he came <em> closest </em> to trusting Malfoy, of all his Death Eaters.</p><p>“Of course, Brax. You have been very useful… invaluable, even. Keep me updated on the Ostara celebration. I will owl you this week regarding the preparations. Also, I need you to keep an eye and ear open regarding those heirlooms that I mentioned. I will be at an auction tomorrow for Borgin and I hope to come across something there. It is very important to me that I find them. And Malfoy…”</p><p>Abraxas leaned closer, sensing that Tom had something persistent niggling in his mind. </p><p>“Do you know… or have you ever met a witch by the name of Hermione?”</p><p>Abraxas was taken aback. “Why… no, I’ve never heard the name.”</p><p>Tom nodded, clearly preoccupied. After a moment, he looked at his watch and then clapped a hand on Abraxas’ shoulder. “I must go. Take care, Malfoy. Look for my owl.”</p><p>Abraxas watched Lord Voldemort’s black robes whipping about as he stepped through the entrance to Borgin and Burkes.</p>

<strong>February 10, 1948</strong>
</p><p><br/>The day was Tuesday and the time was mid-morning, about ten o’clock when Hermione woke to a familiar rap on the window of her room at the inn. She wasn’t accustomed to sleeping in, but she had spent her entire night reading about current events and the like and pouring over the divination books she’d kept in her beaded bag. Hermione’s understanding of the tarot cards that Madame Violette had examined in her reading was becoming much more keen in her present circumstances, but she still had yet to decipher the meaning of a few of them. She had extended her stay at the inn but regrettably, her galleons were slowly dwindling. Soon, she would have to dip into the coffers and chests she’d been given by the Malfoys which were still carefully stowed away in her beaded bag. Despite wanting to save them for her philanthropical endeavors, she decided that due to her current situation, her hopes and dreams for a muggle-born foundation wouldn’t do much good if she herself couldn’t get through the better part of this week.</p><p>The big gray owl dropped in her hand a note from Headmaster Dumbledore. He requested her presence in his office that afternoon if she was available.</p><p>She donned her red robes, hoping that her Gryffindor colors would bring her an extra bit of luck. Perhaps she should’ve invested in a vial of Felix Felicis, but there was no time for that now.</p><p>After a hearty lunch in the dining room of the inn, Hermione set off to Hogwarts with her heart in her throat.</p><hr/><p><br/>“Have a seat, Miss Granger.”</p><p>Dumbledore wore bright orange robes with gold trim; they complimented his blue eyes and auburn hair, making him look quite Merlin-esque in his finery. </p><p>Hermione sat before him, lifting her chin proudly to meet his stare.</p><p>“I have examined your memories in-depth, Miss Granger. I have decided that I do not wish to know any further details concerning the events of the future. I do trust that you will do your best to execute positive change with that knowledge regarding these future happenings, but I implore you to do so with the utmost secrecy and care. Not one soul can know the truth about you, Miss Granger. The danger is too great. I fear for your safety. Have you any training at all, in occlumency?”</p><p>“I do, sir. I’m perhaps not as skilled as yourself, but I am proficient.”</p><p>“Good… good. I will see to it that you are trained in this skill to the best of my ability. I will see to it personally. That is imperative.”</p><p>Her eyes widened. “That would be incredible, Headmaster.”</p><p>He nodded as he looked down at her thoughtfully. “I have thought at length about what we might do about your situation. You require a new identity, one which doesn’t draw too many questions. I have had a rather enlightened idea, which at first, seemed to be the opposite of what is necessary… but the more I think about it, I believe the solution is quite perfect. That is, if you will agree to it.”</p><p>“What solution would that be, Headmaster?”</p><p>His blue eyes were intense. “I would like you to be presented to the wizarding world as my long-lost daughter, Hermione. This would provide you with a level of protection that I doubt you will be able to achieve any other way.”</p><p>Hermione sputtered. “Excuse me? But… your daughter? How would that work?”</p><p>He gazed over her shoulder as he spoke. “There was an old friend of mine, whom I was rather close with as a younger man. She has recently passed away. Beautiful, charming witch. Her name was Eleanor Dagworth-Granger, a distant cousin of the potioneering Dagworth-Grangers. Many of my contemporaries can corroborate the claim. She lived in Edinburgh and would have brought you up there. She was a spectacularly gifted witch. I will see to it that the necessary memory charms are performed and that you are educated on the details of the story. Upon her recent death, you discovered a letter from her informing you of the truth about your paternal lineage. None other than myself, of course.”</p><p>Hermione was silent for a moment as she absorbed this information. At last, she spoke. “But wouldn’t that cause quite a stir, Professor? I wouldn’t want to imposition you in any way with my situation. It <em> was </em> my <em> own </em> curiosity and stupidity that brought me here, after all.” She winced, looking very much humbled.</p><p>“I have to admit that it will draw quite a bit of attention to you, however, from what I can see of the memories you’ve so graciously shared with me, our relationship in the future is akin to that of a father and daughter. Perhaps not as intimate, but there seems to be a kind of closeness there. The thought that you should be here, in this time, and find yourself quite alone, rather disturbs me. I, also, find myself quite alone and it seems that particular circumstance is unlikely to change with the sands of time, therefore, I would… welcome such a kinship in my life.”</p><p>Hermione was shocked. “You- you would… Have <em> me </em>? As your daughter? In truth?”</p><p>He chuckled, his blue eyes twinkling with mirth, and at that moment he reminded Hermione painfully of the Headmaster she had known in her first year. The memory of his death singed her heart and made the moment even more poignant. Tears filled her eyes, threatening to spill over. </p><p>“Now, child, don’t go shedding tears on my account.”</p><p>“I’m sorry, Headmaster, I just can’t help myself. How utterly <em> embarrassing </em>.” She shook her head, wiping at the wetness on her now pink cheeks.</p><p>“Well, then, it’s settled. I daresay, staying close to the truth is the wisest solution. You should keep your name, Hermione. I have no qualms about you using the surname of Dumbledore, but I shall leave that choice up to you. It wouldn’t be entirely unbelievable for a young girl who has grown up using her mother’s surname for the majority of her life to <em> wish </em> to continue to use that name. Most especially if she has had no knowledge of or contact with her father throughout the years. I have a ministry contact who owes me a very large favor; he will draft your identification papers. In fact, I have quite a few favors to call in at the ministry. To my knowledge, this solution is the safest path for you, Hermione. With you as my daughter, there would be those who would be hesitant to harm you. I believe it would effectively silence any questions regarding your background.”</p><p>Hermione was dumbfounded. “I- Thank you.” Her voice was soft.</p><p>He smiled, waving a hand as if to dismiss her thanks. “There’s no need, child. You have already done much for the world. Consider this my gratitude. I confess, I also hope that you might be able to infuse this timeline with great change. Perhaps, mold a better future, with your knowledge.”</p><p>She bit the side of her cheek. “Should I even attempt that? You once told me that time was dangerous when meddled with. What if I alter circumstances irreversibly?”</p><p>“Would that be so wrong, Miss Granger?”</p><p>She looked doubtful. “It could be.”</p><p>He leaned forward, his blue eyes mysterious and searching. “Yes, it could, but the future could also be changed for the better. That will be your dilemma, I’m afraid. You alone will have to decide how to proceed with the knowledge you possess. Nevertheless, I want to encourage you. You are <em> here </em> now, and you are living your life as we speak. If you wish to return to your time, I will do all that I can to discover a path to send you, but you mustn’t rely on my being able to uncover such a method. I confess I’m rather astounded that a wizard in my own time was able to create such an object. I’m both challenged and dismayed by the fact. I will do my best to discover the secrets of this object, however, do not count on my abilities. In the meantime, I will do my best to afford you the ability to carve out your own existence here in this time, in this world. For it is entirely possible that you may never find your way back to your own time, Miss Granger. The sooner you accept that fact, the better.”</p><p>She swallowed and gave a sharp nod. “I understand, Professor.”</p><p>“Call me Albus, Hermione.” His smile was gentle. “We have much catching up to do, it seems. I will ask very little of you, but I shall require you to check in once a week for tea on Sundays. Please be sure to owl me if you cannot attend.”</p><p>She gave an incredulous laugh. “I don’t think I could bring myself to call you <em> Albus, </em> sir, but I shall try. And, of course, I shall come for tea.”</p><p>He leaned back in his chair. “It will be the perfect time to work on your occlumency skills.”</p><p>“Of course. But how am I to explain not having attended Hogwarts?”</p><p>He seemed to deliberate on this. “Your mother feared that you would discover the truth about your paternity and wished to keep you from me. Therefore, she homeschooled you. I think you should be able to take your NEWTs here, at Hogwarts. I saw your overwhelming desire to take them, in your memories. Do you think you are ready? If not, I believe we could arrange for you to attend school a bit longer.”</p><p>She blushed. “I certainly think I’m ready. I had intended to retake my seventh year as I missed out on it due to the war. But I think I’m well past that curriculum now.”</p><p>He nodded. “Then you shall take your NEWTs this week, Miss Granger.”</p><p>She could barely conceal her grin. “I think I could enjoy this. Playing the part, that is. I always thought I’d make a good actress.”</p><p>He inclined his head, eyeing her thoughtfully. “There is some allure, in pretending to be someone else. To escape our own shell, to be displaced into another world, can be an intoxicating temptation. Just be sure, Hermione, not to lose yourself. As I’ve said, this is your life, and you are currently living it, no matter the time in which you find yourself.”</p><p>She nodded, swiftly sobering. He was right, as always. </p><p>“Are you still staying in Diagon Alley?”</p><p>“Yes, sir.”</p><p>“During the school year, I make my abode here in the castle, but you are more than welcome to stay at my own residence in Godric’s Hollow in my absence. Perhaps we will meet there, for tea on Sundays. Despite whatever our future relationship will be, I’ve still yet to get to know you. You will have to be patient with me as I navigate the new role of ‘father’. Luckily, you have parents of your own somewhere, so I hope you won’t think too harshly of me if I fail to live up to their legacy.”</p><p>“<em> Father… </em>” she whispered. </p><p>He nodded. “This will make quite the stir, I fear, in magical society, for the foreseeable future. I will secure you an invitation to a ministry fundraiser which I am required to attend next week. It will be a safe, secure place to introduce you to the wizarding world as my daughter. I will also ensure that the article that will inevitably be released in The Daily Prophet is a positive one. The editor of the paper is a good friend of mine… he’s quite easily swayed by extravagant gifts, but a pleasant fellow all the same. To get ahead of the story and use it to your advantage is the smartest course of action.”</p><p>Then he looked down at her with a serious expression. “From what I’ve gathered of you from your memories, you are a formidable witch. I have deemed it necessary to do whatever I am able to help you, should you decide to take preemptive action against this dark wizard who has caused so much destruction in the future.” His stoic expression faded, and his smile returned. “Now! Go and prepare yourself. I will owl Twilfit and Tattings this evening. You will need formal robes for the upcoming fundraiser. Purchase whatever you have need of, you will no longer need gold at any establishments in Diagon Alley.”</p><p>Hermione’s eyebrows raised. She could hardly believe Dumbledore’s generosity. “I- Thank you, Headmaster.”</p><p>Her mind churned with all of this new information and the world of possibilities that had just been unlocked. <em> Not now </em> , she thought. <em> I’ll have to process everything when I’m back at the inn </em>.</p><p>She wandlessly conjured a slip of paper bearing her address and laid it on Dumbledore’s desk, then said her goodbyes, and made her way back to Diagon Alley.</p><p>As the Granger girl made her way out of his office, Dumbledore released a sigh of relief. Yes, keeping the girl close was the safest course of action. He could not allow her memories to fall into the wrong hands. There were quite a number of wizards who would resort to any means necessary to extract such knowledge and such temptations were too great to leave to chance. Yes, he had a civic duty to perform in order to protect the girl. He worried, most of all, that he would need to protect her from himself.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">
<b>February 28, 1948</b>
</p><p> </p><p>Tom Riddle made his way down the cobblestone street of Diagon Alley toward the Leaky Cauldron. He was a few minutes late for the meeting with his Death Eaters, a diversion from his usual promptness caused by another alarming dream. He picked up the pace; he didn’t mind making others wait, but he’d developed a nervous tick, a compulsive behavior that he was almost enslaved to at this point in his life. It was the same kind of obsession that made him loathe to step on cracks as a child. There were cracks <em>everywhere </em>at Wool’s orphanage, and it made getting anywhere quite difficult. He didn’t like that this preoccupation controlled him, but he walked briskly everywhere he went, all the same.</p><p>The heels of his shoes clacked on the smooth stones of the street until he approached the newsstand, tossing a few knuts at the newsboy as he grabbed a copy of The Daily Prophet. He unfolded it as he walked, scanning the headline absentmindedly until he halted, and stopped dead in his tracks.</p><p>The headline read, in huge, black letters: “<em> Reunited! Dark Wizard Duelist Dumbledore Discovers Long-Lost Daughter </em>”</p><p>Beneath the headline was a photo of a pretty witch with dark eyes and a mysterious smile. Her lashes fluttered prettily in the moving photograph.</p><p><em> Hermione</em>.</p><p>Well, if it wasn’t his newest <em>fixation</em>. The black and white photo stared glaringly back at him. He rolled his head from side to side, cracking his neck in vexation.</p><p>Dumbledore’s daughter? Since <em>when </em>did the arrogant old wizard have a <em> daughter</em>?</p><p>

</p><p> </p><p>Tom quickly ripped open the paper to page thirteen and read the article at length, and for once chucked his bizarre obsession with punctuality to the wind.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Tom dropped the copy of the Prophet onto the table in front of Abraxas Malfoy. He forewent any apologies or formalities regarding his lack of timeliness in favor of a line of questioning which took obvious precedence.</p><p>“What is this?” he asked coolly.</p><p>Abraxas maintained his composure admirably as he sipped his tea. “I’ve only just seen the story myself this morning, my Lord. It seems to have been kept quite <em> hush hush </em>until now."</p><p>He glared at Malfoy. “Since when does Dumbledore have a daughter?”</p><p>“Since now, apparently,” Abraxas answered in a clipped, aristocratic cadence.</p><p>Tom gazed around the table, noting each face. A few of his Death Eaters had now taken the paper and were passing it around, reading the article with no small amount of shock.</p><p>One of the house elves that worked in the Cauldron appeared and began summoning breakfast dishes with a snap of his fingers.</p><p>“I’d rather not learn things of this import from the front page of the Prophet,” Tom said icily.</p><p>“This is the first I’ve heard of it, Tom, I assure you. I cannot have ears <em> everywhere </em>.”</p><p>Tom’s head snapped up to meet Malfoy’s gaze and his eyes flashed red. “What did you call me?”</p><p>“Forgive me, my Lord,” Abraxas whispered with a slight tremor in his voice. “Old habits die <em> hard </em>.”</p><p>“See that they do die, Mr. Malfoy.”</p><p>Abraxas bowed his head.</p><p>“Another Gryffindor,” Tom spat, eyeing the girl’s face as the paper made its round back to the front of the table. “How unfortunate.”</p><p>At least he had an answer to his questions about the witch now. No wonder she feared him. Dumbledore had likely already poisoned her with a diatribe against Tom’s character. He did, however, take pleasure in the thought that Dumbledore had considered him dangerous enough to give advance warning to his daughter.</p><p>But… a daughter? <em> Dumbledore</em>? It was unprecedented. It was simply <em>bizarre</em>.</p><p>Abraxas eyed her photograph for a moment before muttering, “She’s quite pretty.”</p><p>Tom rolled his eyes, then settled him with a withering look. He knew Abraxas too well. “She’s <em> Dumbledore’s </em>daughter. I wouldn’t advise getting on his bad side.”</p><p>Abraxas tilted his head as if considering. “It could prove advantageous. Perhaps, even put a chap on Dumbledore’s good side, if done properly. Dumbledore did, at one time, hold ideals sympathetic to our cause. Perhaps his daughter could be a powerful ally.”</p><p>Tom scoffed at the idiocy of his comrade. Abraxas wasn’t a total plum, but he did often think with his <em>other </em>wand. “I sincerely doubt an attempt at getting into his daughter’s knickers would prove <em> advantageous </em> .” Tom glanced at her photo disdainfully. “Besides, she’s a <em> Dumbledore</em>. That means she’s practically a Gryffindor. How much fun could that possibly be?”</p><p>Abraxas grinned. “Oh, I don’t know. I’ve had my fair share of Gryffindors. They’re quite adventurous… <em> and </em> passionate.”</p><p>Tom ignored his friend. He had a way of effectively severing conversations when they began to irk him. He would never stoop so low as to put his cock in a Gryffindor. He wasn’t desperate by any stretch of the imagination.</p><p>Plus, he hated Dumbledore. He hated Gryffindors. So, naturally, he despised Hermione Dumbledore.</p><p>Although… his instant dislike of her made her fear of him that much more… <em> erotic</em>.</p><p>Tom straightened his tie, quite irritated at the betrayal of his own mind, which he usually had better control of.</p><p>“We are Slytherins, Brax. Dumbledore barely disguised his dislike of us in school, as it were. I’d stay as far away from her as possible.”</p><p>“I just can’t even believe Dumbledore has a daughter,” muttered Avery. “I mean, I thought he preferred… er, you know…” He lowered his voice to a whisper. “Preferred <em> blokes </em> to-”</p><p>“We <em>all </em>thought that,” Dolohov interrupted with an eye roll.</p><p>“S’pose he prefers both, yeah?” replied Macnair.</p><p>Dolohov grinned. “I know I do.”</p><p>“That means nothing though. We all know you’re a slimy git, and you’d stick your wand in a manticore if it would let you,” Malfoy sneered.</p><p>He appeared to consider. “I suppose if it put up a good fight...”</p><p>“I’m done eating.”</p><p>“You’re mental.”</p><p>“Pretty disgusting, mate.”</p><p>Tom sipped his coffee, effectively tuning out their juvenile raillery as he stared thoughtfully at Dumbledore’s <em>supposed </em>next-of-kin. She wasn’t much like him in the way of looks, but that wasn’t necessarily indicative of anything.</p><p><em> Hermione</em>. Now that he thought about it, it was quite an odd name. He recognized it from muggle literature. Shakespeare, was it? He would have to double-check. Now that he knew her purported identity, he firmly decided to make it his business to uncover everything about her, seeing as she was <em> Dumbledore’s </em>daughter. That made her, tentatively, his enemy. He hated his old transfiguration professor wholeheartedly, and to now have his very own offspring nearby… Would she be as magically proficient as her father? Time would tell. </p><p>But where had she <em>been </em>all these years? Surely if Dumbledore had known about her, she would have been a student at Hogwarts? </p><p><em> Hermione</em>.</p><p>It was the kind of strange name that <em> Albus Percival Wulfric Brian </em> Dumbledore would give a child. He <em>was </em>rather eccentric. Had he named her himself? Or perhaps, the mother? Who was this witch? There was very little stated about the woman in the article, save that her name was Eleanor. But what if her mother was a <em> muggle</em>? Was that something Dumbledore intended to keep quiet? Had he even known about the birth of his daughter? And <em>why </em>was she seemingly nonexistent up until now?</p><p>The barrage of questions stirring in his mind threatened to drive him mad, so he occluded them to the back of his mind and forced himself back to the task at hand.</p><p>“So,” he turned back to Malfoy. “About Ostara…”</p><p> </p>

</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Hermione lounged on the outdoor patio of Dumbledore’s home in Godric’s Hollow. She instantly fell in love with the Tudor style cottage, with its brick facade, wood accents, and diamond-patterned windows. She sat at a quaint little iron table overlooking the gardens, wearing only her silk jimjams with a short silk robe tied around her waist. Fuzzy little slippers cushioned her feet, and she sipped her tea from a mint-condition Royal Albert teacup.</p><p>She’d been stuck in 1948 for a few weeks now. For the first two, she’d woken up in the morning, groggy, wondering where she was, only to have the entire experience come flooding back as she recalled that she was, indeed, stuck in the past, far away from all of her friends and loved ones. Ron and Harry would have surely realized she was gone by now.</p><p>No, she wouldn’t think about them right now. </p><p>She’d had a chance to do much thinking this week and had come to the conclusion that she <em> must </em> do whatever she can to alter the events of the future. Initially, she thought it best to leave well enough alone. After all, Voldemort was dead, wasn’t he? But after mentally revisiting all of the death, destruction, and carnage that Voldemort himself had wrought over the course of many decades, she realized that many lives hung in the balance and <em> those </em> people deserved to exist in a free and peaceful world. She could save Fred’s life… Remus and Tonks… Harry’s parents. Sirius. Dobby. She imagined so many countless faces. Voldemort had committed very <em> real </em> genocide. She could not, in good conscience, allow that to happen.</p><p><em> Now </em> , she thought. <em> How shall I go about accomplishing such a thing? </em></p><p>She knew she would have to kill Voldemort. That much was clear.</p><p>After all, there really was no changing a person <em> that </em> mentally disturbed, right? Something was clearly very off in his psyche since childhood. People like that couldn’t simply be fixed, could they?</p><p>How old was the sociopath now, anyway? 22? 23?</p><p>She was lucky at least that he hadn’t realized the fullness of his magical abilities yet, although he had already created at least two horcruxes by now. She would have to check up on Hepzibah Smith and ensure that the woman did not <em> ever </em> invite Tom Riddle into her home. That would be disastrous. Simply yet another death that Hermione could prevent.</p><p>“In order to kill him,” she muttered to herself. “I’ll have to get close to him somehow. <em> Right </em> . That’s the <em> only </em> conceivable way. I will have to find a way to get close to him, find out where the Horcruxes are hidden, and then destroy <em> those </em> . Then he will simply be a mortal man, and I can kill him in any <em> number </em> of ways.”</p><p>She imagined slitting his throat with a goblin-wrought blade. She imagined casting her first killing curse at him. How fitting.</p><p>In the <em> meantime </em>, she could artfully undermine his political influence and infiltrate his social circles. </p><p><em> Soon </em> , she thought. It had been quite a busy week and Hermione was positively knackered. On Thursday she had taken her NEWTs, which had been quite an ordeal in itself. She wished she had had a bit more time to study and prepare, but her fears were allayed when she received her results. All <em> outstandings </em>. Dumbledore had beamed at her, and she blushed under her idol’s praise.</p><p>Then, last night, Albus had escorted her to the Ministry Fundraiser for Magical Creatures, which she immensely enjoyed. She’d seen many creatures she had studied about but never seen in person. Then there were quite a few whispers and murmurs about her throughout the night, but Dumbledore patiently introduced her to all the influential names and faces of wizarding Britain. She even met the current Minister of Magic, Leonard Spencer-Moon, and had a delightful conversation with him about his working relationship with Winston Churchill. She'd even met Draco's grandfather, Abraxas Malfoy, although he seemed to be in his early twenties and possessed all the charm and gallantry that Draco sorely lacked. He was quite gentlemanly and had begged her to let him owl her an invitation to his manor sometime; Hermione had acquiesced but didn't relish the thought at all of returning to that manor. Still, she realized that Abraxas was, in all likelihood, close to Tom Riddle, and she filed that away in the back of her mind as a potential strategy and path to infiltrate his circle.</p><p>All seemed to go to plan, and there were few if any, difficult questions regarding her background. Dumbledore had seemingly hushed up that particular aspect so that most of the attention seemed directed toward her up-and-coming career plans for the near future.</p><p>What <em> were </em> her plans in that respect? She hadn’t given it much thought. She would need a job that would allow her some level of influence, where she would be able to gain the power to undermine Voldemort’s own potential impact.</p><p>She picked up today’s copy of<em> The Daily Prophet </em>, scanned the headlines for the day, and read with interest the job listings on the back pages.</p><p>Suddenly, as if fate itself had whispered in her ear, she had an <em> inspired </em> idea.</p><p>But, <em> of course </em>!</p><p>If the war had taught her anything, it was that the workers behind the scenes of the ministry had very little pull and sway in controlling the balance of power. A career drafting legislation wouldn’t, in fact, give her any real power in society, as she had once thought. And gaining power as an auror was a possibility, but it typically took years to work up to a position of authority and trust within the ministry.</p><p>She gazed at her copy of <em> The Prophet </em>. She thought back to the war, and the way that Rita Skeeter had manipulated the masses with her cunning lies and duplicitous words. She had steadily crafted a narrative that painted Harry, Dumbledore, and the Order as the villains, instilling the fear of muggles into every witch and wizard in Britain, and directing the world to look to Voldemort as their savior. Rita Skeeter had written terrible lies about Hermione as well, which had led Hermione to vindictively trap her in a jar for the better part of a year. Hermione smiled to herself at the memory. </p><p><em> She deserved it </em> , she thought innocently. <em> I did the world a favor. </em></p><p>No, power wasn’t in working hard, studying carefully, drafting laws, and forming committees.</p><p>Power was in <em> words </em> . Dumbledore had already given her a public persona, a name that commanded the attention of the magical community. All of society was already curious about <em> Hermione Dumbledore </em> . Perhaps, she should give them a good idea of what Dumbledore’s mysterious daughter <em> truly </em> believed in.</p><p>Hermione smiled smugly to herself as she folded up her copy of the Prophet and made her way inside. She promptly wrote a letter and sent it off with her new tawny owl, Perdita, a gift for Dumbledore’s daughter, courtesy of The Magical Menagerie. </p><p>The editor of The Daily Prophet had, after all, owled her already, requesting a personal interview with herself. She would simply grant him the interview, and then take it a step further. </p><p>Perhaps the old Hermione would have shied away from the limelight, but not <em> this </em> Hermione. This battle-hardened new version of herself was not in the least bit afraid to wage public war on this time’s pureblood ideologies, bigoted beliefs, blatant mistreatment of magical creatures, and even Voldemort himself. She would cut the head off the snake before he even began to slither his way into the public eye.</p><p>
<em> I’m coming for you, Mr. Riddle. </em>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Cum dripped down Walburga Black’s legs. Tom hated the sight of it, so he waved his wand to cast a <em> scourgify </em> and then added another little flick of a contraception charm while he zipped up his trousers. It had been months since he’d let her come over to his flat and truthfully, he’d intended to cut her off altogether, but he had been rather carnally-minded of late since his chance meeting with Hermione Dumbledore and the pent-up sexual frustration was beginning to affect his dreams and, by extension, his sleep. He was more irritated and frequently snapped at his Death Eaters. He had used the torture curse on Macnair yesterday and although the sod had deserved it, he probably wouldn’t have done it if he weren’t so bloody on edge. That just wouldn’t do. </p><p>He begrudgingly let Walburga come over in the evening after work, but he regretted it almost immediately. He’d bent her over his bare dining room table and fucked her from behind so he didn’t have to see her face or her obnoxiously large tits. He hated to admit that he’d pictured Hermione’s pretty brown eyes and smaller chest when he finished.</p><p>This was the last time he would fuck Walburga Black. Of course, there were other attractive witches in line behind Walburga. There always had been; scores of them, in fact. But he'd stuck with Walburga because at least, she could keep her mouth shut, for the most part, and she didn't cause trouble for him. At least, she hadn't in the past; but recently, as her engagement to Orion grew more solidified and her family put more pressure on her, she'd begun to drive Tom absolutely mad. He knew what she wanted, and Tom despised nothing more than being pressured into something he didn't want to do.</p><p>He had nothing whatsoever to feel guilty about; his intentions with her had been made perfectly clear from the very start. If she got hurt, that was her own bloody fault, wasn't it? Guilt was not an emotion Tom was capable of. Nor remorse, for that matter. Tom, after all, was painstakingly careful with his every action, thought, and deed. Everything he did had a rationale, a justification behind it. When he did terrible things, it was only because the ends must certainly justify the means. His vision took precedence over everything else in his life.</p><p>So all in all, he had decided that fucking Walburga had lost its luster. His hand would be much more satisfying, in all truth. He had thought her quite beautiful in their school days, but there was nothing at all interesting about her in actuality. Her magical skill was rather dull, her views bland and bigoted, her opinions all borrowed from more well-educated witches and wizards, and her personality was what you’d typically expect from a prim and proper pureblood princess. He’d grown to truly despise the witch.</p><p>She walked up behind him and wrapped her arms around his waist, dragging her long, dark nails across his chest and pressing her full lips to his shoulder blade. “Are you leaving so soon, Tom?”</p><p>“Walburga,” he said with an air of polite irritation. He extracted himself from her clutch and turned, his black eyes pinning her with a scathing look. “I told you this at the onset of our little arrangement. We are merely fucking. Nothing more.”</p><p>“And when was the last time we did that?” she snapped.</p><p>He sighed. “I don’t recall. In fact, we may never do so again. You’re becoming quite exhausting the way you follow me around, watching me like a bloody hawk. Perhaps you are becoming more trouble than you’re worth?”</p><p>She glared at him with intense hatred. “I wish everyone knew who you really are.”</p><p>He walked over to the front door of his flat where the newsboy had shoved a copy of <em> The Daily Prophet </em> under his door. He bent over and picked it up. “Don’t worry. One day, they all will.”</p><p>“You’re an arrogant sod, Tom.”</p><p>He looked at her searchingly. She was quite beautiful. Her black hair fell in dark waves down her back. Her skin was the color of fresh milk and her lips were full and red. She was in possession of crystalline blue eyes. Her family was ancient and powerful, and he would need their influence in the future. Tom had contemplated an advantageous marriage at length, years ago, despite how distasteful he found the idea. It was possible that Walburga imagined she could entrap him using her affluence and noble bloodline. She was aware that he sought to align himself with a slew of wealthy and influential pureblood families. </p><p>Still, marriage itself was something that would ultimately be more trouble than it was worth.</p><p>Beyond that, he had no need or desire for heirs. One has no need of a successor when one plans to live forever.</p><p>Despite the fact that she was attractive and perfectly situated in the social and political climate, he couldn’t shake the fact that she <em> fucking </em> irritated him to his core. There was just no help for it. She barely even aroused him anymore.</p><p>Her luster had begun to fade when Hermione Dumbledore appeared. That irritated Tom to no end. It made him hate the cunt even more.</p><p>He <em> despised </em> Dumbledore’s offspring with unbridled fury. <em> If </em> she was even Dumbledore’s blood, which Tom was rather hesitant to believe, given the circumstances.</p><p>Exhaustion overcame Tom suddenly. He was propelled by a sudden need to get this witch<em> off his back</em> most expeditiously. Still, he would need to tread carefully where Walburga was concerned. He supposed he might still have use for her and her family in the future, after all.</p><p>In a rush of both calculation and impulsion, he stood as if to leave. As he passed by her, he reached out and lifted her chin, bringing her blue eyes to his. </p><p>“I think, my dear, it’s time for us to come to a natural end. What we need, perhaps, is the freedom to explore. If it’s meant to be, it will be. Who knows what the future holds? But for now, I think its goodbye.”</p><p>Her mouth fell open slightly in shock. She clearly had not expected this. “You’re… ending this?”</p><p>“What did you expect, Walburga? We are not, and have never been, an item.”</p><p>She swallowed. “I… It’s just sudden, that’s all.”</p><p><em> Gentle, Tom. You can be gentle. </em>He leaned down with a smirk on his lips, his black eyes sparkling into hers. “You know mummy and daddy Black would never allow a half-blood into the family. I’m doing you a favor. Besides, I’m quite aware of the contract with your cousin’s name on it.”</p><p>Her cheeks heated prettily. “I- that’s… Is that the reason you’re ending this? The contract?”</p><p>He inclined his head slightly. “One of them.” <em> But not the foremost reason, of course. </em></p><p>She shook her head frantically. “The contract doesn’t matter, Tom. If you truly wanted…”</p><p>He held up a hand, cutting her off. “I’m going to stop you right there, Black. I’m not a suitable candidate for romance, marriage, or anything of the sort. I know that you’re perfectly aware of this. To my own misfortune, I’m not in possession of an infallible bloodline, nor affluence, nor even the disposition to make a woman happy. I have only my own ambition, my own magic, and make no mistake, that <em> is </em> my only pursuit in life. Again, I’m doing you a favor.” He observed that there was a desperate longing in her eyes, the echo of some profound injury. Her features were both suspicious and simultaneously on the verge of breaking. “Allow me to do the right thing on your behalf. I’ve not been a gentleman with you, we both know that. But let me at least save you the emotional torment of having me as a partner.”</p><p>Her voice was soft as she whispered, “You will always torment me, Tom Riddle. Always. Perhaps, that’s what you do best.”</p><p>He sighed. “I hope that we can be friends, even allies, moving forward.” He took her hand in his and kissed the smooth skin covering her hand. “We do know one another, intimately, after all. It would be a shame to lay waste to that.” His smile was warm and dazzling.</p><p>As if dismissing her, he folded open the paper. To his immense irritation, there, on the front cover of The <em> Prophet </em> , was <em> Hermione </em> <b> <em>fucking</em> </b> <em> Dumbledore </em> . He couldn’t wait for London’s obsession with this irritating witch to be over with. His eyes narrowed as he gazed at her photograph. Her warm eyes stared back at him. He read the first few lines of the article and then laughed. She was to be a columnist at <em> The Daily Prophet </em>.</p><p>

</p><p> </p><p>Walburga’s expression grew icy. “I wonder should I warn her?”</p><p>His brow furrowed. “Pardon?”</p><p>“Hermione,” she breathed bitterly. “Dumbledore’s daughter. Perhaps I should warn her of your darker nature. I’m under no illusions that this has <em> nothing </em> to do with her.”</p><p>His brows furrowed in confusion. “What in <em>Salazar’s</em> name would this have to do with her?”</p><p>“Abraxas told me you’ve been asking questions about her. He seems to think you’ve taken an abnormal interest in the girl. Beyond mere political curiosity, that is.”</p><p>He frowned but was careful to keep his expression polite. “The witch is Dumbledore’s offspring, which means she can only be a thorn in my side. You're reaching.”</p><p>Her laughter tinkled menacingly. “Oh, Riddle. You may have the rest of the wizarding world fooled, but I know better. These little games you play, the way you order your pawns around, this quite <em> abrupt </em> ending to our <em> arrangement… </em> I’m not as vacuous and simpleminded as many of your comrades. We do know one another <em> intimately </em>, after all.”</p><p>His jaw tensed, but he kept his features otherwise blank. “I’m not interested in what you imagine my reason to be. If you need to convince yourself of something in order to shield yourself from woundedness and self-destruction, then I cannot begrudge you that. However, be sure to hold your tongue when you find yourself gossiping amongst my Death Eaters and your other pureblooded chits. I will not tolerate your venomous mudslinging campaign born of jealousy and hurt feelings, and you’ll regret ever opening your mouth if you do.”</p><p>Her mouth snapped shut. She glared at him, tears springing into her eyes. “Don’t worry Tom. I’ll leave you to your precious power grab.”</p><p>He’d had enough of her prattle. “I’ve got a meeting.” He straightened, inclining his head toward the door to his flat. “I wish you the best, Black.”</p><p>She hated the way he’d reverted to using her surname. It felt as if he sought to wound her, but she knew it was simply his way of putting distance between them, of reminding her that she’d been demoted from her temporary role in his life. It stung, all the same. “I can’t say I wish the same for you, Riddle.”</p><p>He inclined his head and gripped at his chest as they passed into the corridor. He locked the door behind them. “You wound me.”</p><p>Her lips pulled to the side as if she’d tasted something sour. “We both know that’s not possible.” She spoke to herself now, as he was already gone, halfway down the hall. “Your heart is as cold as the arctic.”</p><p> </p><p> </p>

</p><p> </p><p>Tom Riddle stood in the library of Malfoy Manor, seething. He’d arrived promptly at five o’clock in the morning to spend a few quiet hours studying before work. He intended to come back after work and subsequently planned to come back for the next few days since he found the library to be soothing when he was angry. Books had always been his escape. Every challenge he had been presented with in life had been solved by finding the right book. Malfoy Manor had the most extensive selection of rare tomes, rivaling even the Hogwarts library and the somewhat shoddy library at Diagon Alley. Libraries were his favorite place on earth. One of the great tragedies of history, he had decided, was the burning of the Library at Alexandria. He deeply wanted to know what magical tomes and ancient knowledge had been burnt to cinders in those flames.</p><p>No one would bother him here. He had complete silence, a crackling fire, and a decanter full of expensive fire whiskey for the next few days, and he could think of no better cure for his illness.</p><p>He brought a stack of books with him that he didn’t think he’d find in the Manor’s library. <em> Muggle </em> books. Despite his slight disdain for muggles, he did enjoy their literature. A guilty pleasure of his. </p><p>His irritation stemmed primarily from Hermione Dumbledore. In the past two and a half weeks that she had been writing for the <em> Prophet </em>, she’d already written six articles that frustrated him to no end. Although he’d found the articles to be, to his immense frustration, well-written, inspired, deeply philosophical, and well-researched, they were in direct opposition to the collection of his own beliefs, but more importantly, they conflicted squarely with the views of his Death Eaters. </p><p>Articles such as: </p><ul>
<li><em>House Elves, or House Slaves? A Morally-Bankrupt Practice </em></li>
</ul><ul>
<li><em>The Woeful World of Werewolves: A Treatise on Werewolf Welfare</em></li>
</ul><ul>
<li><em>Blood Purity Stifles Genetic Code say Muggle Scientists</em></li>
</ul><ul>
<li><em>Magical Muggles: Understanding the Mysterious Culture of this Misunderstood Race</em></li>
</ul><ul>
<li><em>Dark Lords: Daft or Dangerous?</em><br/><br/></li>
<li><em>Tainted: The Corrupting Power of Dark Magic</em></li>
</ul><p>He had ripped his last copy of the Prophet in half. He hated Hermione Dumbledore, reason one being that he found her extremely intelligent and articulate, and that <em> turned him on </em>. Reason two being that he hated being aroused by a woman who was working so vehemently to destroy the groundwork of his own organization. He wondered just how much Dumbledore knew about him and his Death Eaters, and subsequently, how much information had he bequeathed to his daughter. He simply must find out.</p><p>He wanted to <em> teach </em> the Dark Arts at Hogwarts. Not just the <em> Defense </em> of the Dark Arts, but the <em> use </em> of them. But Hermione Dumbledore argued that using the Dark Arts was a curse that acted as a seed of madness. That seed only served to grow, bloom, and become a poisonous garden within one’s soul that could not be remedied once rooted. She wrote quite convincingly that the use of Dark Magic if left unchecked, would drive the user to madness.</p><p>She’d written this, of course, after new legislation had been pitched at the Ministry regarding the Unforgivable curses. </p><p>Then, there were her views on muggles and purebloods. It was absolutely infuriating. </p><p>He had no love for muggles or any particular hate for them either, but he had planned for years to use the fear of muggles and their past dissent with wizards as a tactic to weaken the Statute of Secrecy. His primary followers were purebloods who adhered to the idea of magical supremacy as well as blood purity and she was effectively casting a negative light on those beliefs, as well as expertly planting seeds of doubt and appealing to the emotions of her readers. </p><p>It was almost as if… as if she were as skilled a manipulator as Voldemort himself. </p><p>She was a threat… and threats must always be extinguished.</p><p>But first, he had to learn more about Hermione Dumbledore.</p><p>He had studied muggle philosophy and the strategic minds of the greatest muggle war generals and dictators.</p><p>A favorite book of his, one that currently sat in his stack in the manor library, was <em> The Art of War </em> by Sun Tzu.<br/><br/>“<em>I</em><em>f you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.” </em></p><p>It was imperative that he discover everything he could about Hermione. Then, he would make a move. But only when the proper moment presented itself. </p><p>
<em> “If it is to your advantage, make a forward move. If not, stay where you are.” </em>
</p><p>He had to consider Dumbledore. His old professor was, after all, a complication.</p><p>Tom heard the heavy doors to the library open and turned to find Abraxas entering the room.</p><p>“I’m pleased to see you here this morning, my Lord. Making use of this old library certainly warms my heart.”</p><p>“I’m sure,” Tom replied derisively. “I need a book with a better description of the Protean charm than the one I own.”</p><p>Malfoy inclined his head. “There are many, although I admit, I’m not the most skilled at that particular charm. It is rather difficult, and I’ve never had much need for it myself.”</p><p>“What reason have you for discussing me with Walburga Black?” Tom’s tone was cutting, and the sudden change in topic caught Abraxas off guard.</p><p>“My Lord?”</p><p>“Is there a <em> reason </em> that you felt the desperate <em> need </em> to mention my interest in Hermione Dumbledore to Walburga?”</p><p>“I- It was merely a passing comment in casual conversation.”</p><p>“She seemed to think you had <em> insinuated </em> I had some ulterior <em> interest </em> in Miss Dumbledore.”</p><p>“Why- no… that was not my intention, my Lord. Walburga had merely mentioned your distant attitude toward her of late and asked me what I thought of it. I simply replied by saying that you were busy with planning and strategy and had been working more than usual… and then I mentioned that you were a bit preoccupied with Miss Dumbledore, seeing as the circumstances of her strange appearance didn’t sit well with you.”</p><p>Tom stared at the library shelves, the muscles in his jaw tensing as he ground his teeth. Where was that <em> fucking </em> book?</p><p>He turned sharply, pointing a finger at Malfoy. “Our <em> discussions </em> are not to be repeated to anyone. Least of all non-Death Eaters. Do you understand me?”</p><p>“Yes, my Lord. Forgive me, Walburga is an old friend. It was only natural for us to talk candidly. She was… emotional. I forgot myself.” Abraxas stared at Tom attentively. He could sense something coiled beneath the surface of Tom’s agitation. “Is there… something else bothering you, my friend?”</p><p>Tom found the book he needed. He knew how to cast this particular charm, but he needed to modify it a bit, and then test it rigorously before putting it to use. He would require test subjects… inanimate ones preferably. He couldn’t have anyone walking around with a botched version of his Dark Mark on their skin… that would be inconvenient. But then again, he could probably borrow a muggle or two and wipe their memory after. He’d just have to remove the appendage upon which he’d practiced the charm. Better than killing them, he supposed, although he wasn’t opposed to that course of action either, if he deemed it necessary.</p><p>He pulled the book from the shelf, passing by Malfoy to set the book on top of his stack.</p><p>He breathed out sharply through his nose. “Miss Dumbledore is becoming quite the fucking nuisance.”</p><p>Malfoy inclined his head, choosing his words carefully. Tom rarely used vulgar language, and when he did, it was because he was quite angry. “Her articles are decidedly opinionated, yes.”</p><p>He checked his watch, then realized he was almost late for work. He grabbed the torn-out page that he always used for a bookmark and shoved it in between the pages of the book where the description of the incantation was written.</p><p>At Tom’s continued silence, Malfoy hedged, “If I may, my Lord, perhaps Hermione’s opinions, though strong, could be swayed by the right influence. She could be a powerful ally if she could be convinced of the merits of our particular convictions. Although I think she might perhaps be a little too emotionally committed to the house elf dilemma… you’ll have to pick your battles, Tom.”</p><p>Tom nodded, staring blankly at Malfoy. He hated when Brax called him Tom, but he couldn’t begrudge him that right in private. It was the one unique privilege he allowed him. “Since when do you call her, <em> Hermione, </em>Brax?”</p><p>Malfoy smirked. “Well, I met her personally. At a ministry fundraiser last week. She was wearing a pretty gown, which displayed all of her assets… tastefully. She’s even more attractive in person, I daresay. Dumbledore was flaunting her about. She hit it off quite well with the Minister; they chit-chatted about the muggle Prime Minister Churchhill. Anyway… I owled her. I plan to meet her today, to show her the Manor, in fact.”</p><p>Tom was pleased with Abraxas for taking the initiative to get close to her and he did value his input, but he was rather put off by the fact that Abraxas hadn’t done it for Tom’s benefit, but because he wanted to <em> fuck </em> her. That rankled Tom and added to his growing vexation. </p><p>Tom was mostly aggravated because <em> he </em> wanted to fuck her.</p><p><em> Merlin</em>, but he needed to finally meet this woman.</p><p>Then, he would find that she was dull, ordinary, and lackluster, a boring swot, one without wit or appeal. Then his lust would be doused and he would be able to think clearly enough to fucking destroy her and her noble ideals.</p><p>He’d never met a woman who was able to capture and keep his attention, and he didn’t have hope of that ever-changing. It was his <em> imaginings </em>that kept him thinking of her day and night. His years in the orphanage had forced him to have a vivid imagination; there was nothing else to occupy his time. He had always been able to envision people as some greater version than what they were, which is why he was often disappointed with people. He knew when faced with the reality of this woman, her appeal would fade in his eyes.</p><p>“Abraxas, when you see her, I want you to invite her to the Ostara celebration.”</p><p>Malfoy lifted one eyebrow. “That’s a wonderful idea, Tom. A prime opportunity to bring her into the fold. I shall see that it’s done.”</p><p>“Good. I’ll be back this evening to conduct more research,” Tom muttered before turning sharply, grabbing his dark green cloak, and striding briskly out the door.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Hermione stood at the immense double doors of Malfoy Manor wearing a set of cerulean velvet robes with cobalt stitching. She had a delicate white silk shirt underneath whose collar peeked up around her neck. She was certainly a vision and struck Abraxas Malfoy as a blue spring flower on that Tuesday morning.</p><p>He wanted to charm her more desperately than he’d wanted to charm anyone in quite some time.</p><p>“Miss Dumbledore, welcome to Malfoy Manor. I’m honored that you accepted my invitation to join me for tea.” He bent low, taking her hand in his, and he noted how delicate her fingers were as he pressed his lips to her soft skin. The image flashed through his mind of those little fingers wrapped around his cock, but he shoved it aside.</p><p>Hermione smiled warmly at him, and she thought to herself that he looked somewhat like Draco with short white-blonde hair like cornsilk, but with features less sharp and more aristocratic. His dark brows contrasted with his pale hair above crystalline blue eyes.</p><p>He was tremendously handsome in that male model kind of way, not quite her type but pleasant to look at, all the same. She pushed aside the image of curly black hair and bottomless black eyes.</p><p>“Thank you, Mr. Malfoy, I wouldn’t turn down the chance to see the ancestral home of such an ancient and noble family. I’m nothing if not a student of history.” She smiled sweetly and hoped it came across as genuine. It wasn’t.</p><p>“You flatter me, Miss Dumbledore. Allow me to take your cloak. Dobby!” </p><p>He reached to take her fur cloak and suddenly the elf appeared with a crack. Hermione started at the sudden appearance of the elf and noted that Dobby looked younger and happier than he had been under Lucius’ care. </p><p>“Thank you,” Hermione said warmly to Dobby as he took her cloak. Dobby looked at her as if she’d grown a third arm and disapparated with a crack.</p><p>Abraxas cleared his throat, smiling, and gestured ahead of him. “This way, Miss Dumbledore.”</p><p>He led Hermione through vast hallways, elaborate staircases, and arched doorways. The rooms were outfitted with intricate cornices and baroque embellishments. Paintings of his ancestors lined the hallways and they moved, their eyes following Hermione as she walked past. If she heard a single one of them say the word “Mudblood,” she would rip her goblin-wrought blade from its sheath on her thigh and drag it through the canvas herself.</p><p>Of course, she brought her blade. She didn’t trust purebloods or <em> Malfoys</em>.</p><p>She found the manor beautiful; she’d fully expected it to be showy and ostentatious from what she remembered of her time imprisoned by Bellatrix. The decor in 1948 was much more refined and suitable for the kind of mansion that it was. Truthfully, she didn’t remember all that much about the mansion. It's hard to pay attention to architecture when you’re being crucio’d.</p><p>After showing her through the gardens (which were filled with fairies, fountains, and flowers) and the ballroom, Abraxas attempted to bring her to the drawing room but Hermione politely declined, expressing a firm interest in seeing the famous Malfoy library. At this, he grinned in a very boyish way, and she could tell that he was extremely keen on showing off.</p><p>When he opened up the double doors, Hermione nearly fainted. It was the most extensive and <em>enormous </em>library she had ever seen. The room was as large as the drawing room and spanned two floors. She observed a stone staircase that ascended to the second floor, which consisted of a wrap-around balcony that overlooked the bottom floor and which housed shelves of books that went on for days. The shelves of books on each floor were almost twelve feet tall and required ladders on each side. It was simply <em>extravagant</em>. </p><p>On one side of the room, there was a chiseled marble fireplace and velvet Chesterfield sofas. Floor-to-ceiling windows looked out over the gardens below and opened up onto a large outdoor balcony. On the other side of the room, there was a long, intricately carved wood table, meant for studying. </p><p>She finally took a step into the room, turning slowly in a circle as she examined the colossal crystal chandelier hanging from the ceiling upon which an exquisite mural had been painted.</p><p>Hermione had never seen such splendor and opulence all in one place. And the <em>books</em>! </p><p>Abraxas strode to stand beside her, clearly fascinated with the look on her face.</p><p>“Holy cricket,” she murmured softly. “I fear I may faint.”</p><p>He smiled, his blue eyes appearing enchanted as he watched Hermione. “I daresay, I don’t believe anyone’s ever had such a visceral reaction to this room before.”</p><p>She took a deep breath. “But it’s <em> magnificent</em>, sir.”</p><p>“Please, have a look at the books. We have some of the oldest editions and the rarest tomes you’ll find anywhere in Britain.”</p><p>“<em>Oh my</em>, I’m afraid if I got started, it would take me years to go through them all.” She gazed around with wide eyes, clearly overwhelmed.</p><p>“Please permit me to make a suggestion. If you are someone who loves reading, I would like to extend you an open invitation. You are most welcome to come and browse my library any time you like. It’s open to you. I must ask you to read them here rather than borrow them, but only because that will surely keep you coming back more often.” He smiled, his eyes roaming her face.</p><p>She looked at him in bewilderment. “You would let me come here? And use this library?”</p><p>“Certainly. What good is it, if it’s not being used? You seem very fond of research, from what I’ve read of your column.”</p><p>Her mouth fell open. “You’ve… read my articles?”</p><p>He grinned again, fixing her with a knowing look. “Of course I have.” His lips turned up in amusement as she stared at him in shock, stuttering and trying to find something to say in return. He leaned closer to her so that his blue eyes were level with her brown ones. “I think you’ll find, Miss Dumbledore, that while there might be great differences in our lifestyles and beliefs, the great divide you so imagine there to be between us is not so great, after all. I think, were we to debate on certain issues, we might both find merit in what the other has to say. I, too, want to do good in the world, but the <em> means </em>to achieve such good, as well as the <em> definition </em>of good itself, might be vastly different than what you profess. I confess, I should very much like to introduce you around in my circles. I hope that you will be receptive and forgiving of traditions and practices which you may not fully understand or embrace. Will you keep an open mind? Will you allow me to be your friend?”</p><p>Hermione was shocked by such a speech. It was a flowery and oratorical way of saying that he (and those in his social circles) had reasons and justifications for their bigotry. Still, he’d seemed so genuine about it that she couldn’t very well say no, could she? In fact, he brought up a good point. If she couldn’t be civil and polite to people who disagreed with her… then perhaps she was just as bigoted and self-righteous as they were? It was the mature thing to do, to hear the other side out prior to casting judgments.</p><p>All that aside, she needed Abraxas Malfoy so that she could get close to Tom Riddle. If Malfoy desired to bring her into his social circles, well then, wasn’t that exactly what she needed? He was handing her a strategy on a silver platter. He was almost <em>begging </em>her. The choice was clear.</p><p>“But of course, Mr. Malfoy. I see no reason why we cannot cooperate with one another for the sake of progress. I would love nothing better than to get to know you and your friends.”</p><p>He grinned. “Splendid. In that case, I would like to extend an invitation. We Malfoys have many yearly celebrations. My mother is quite fond of parties; I’m sure she should like to meet you-”</p><p>“But meeting your mother already? You do move quickly sir, don’t you?” she teased, fighting back a smile.</p><p>Malfoy’s heart skipped several beats at this light bit of flirting. It emboldened him, so he continued, “You may look for a formal invitation to our Ostara Ball to come by owl this week. Do you think you would be able to come?”</p><p>“Certainly. I see no reason why I shouldn’t be able to attend.”</p><p>“Then would you do me the honor of allowing me to be your escort?”</p><p>“<em>Oh</em>,” she replied, somewhat surprised. For some reason, the thought of being on the arm of a Malfoy was not as repulsive as it should’ve been. “That would cause quite a splash, wouldn’t it?”</p><p>His eyes sparkled. He gave her a mischievous smirk and muttered, “We could <em> shock </em> them all.”</p><p>Her laughter echoed like music in the vast library. She walked to the nearest shelf and began to scan the various sections, already intent on familiarizing herself. She would certainly take him up on his offer to browse this <em>exquisite </em> library.</p><p>“I would love that, Mr. Malfoy. I should think I would need a formal bodyguard at such an event, which will no doubt include a guest list of Britain’s finest and most ancient <em> pureblood </em> families.” She shot him a coy look. “I’ll most certainly be a lamb amongst wolves.”</p><p>He smiled broadly. Abraxas very much enjoyed this woman’s subtle wit. “You are no lamb, Miss Dumbledore. You are most definitely a <em> lion </em>.”</p><p>“You could be right,” she said mysteriously. “You’ve yet to hear me roar, Mr. Malfoy.”</p><p>He trailed along behind her, observing which books drew her attention. At her declaration, he bent over her shoulder and whispered, “I should very much like to know what that sounds like.”</p><p>Hermione shivered, his meaning not lost on her in the slightest, and she turned to find him very close. She swallowed nervously, feeling a sudden need for escape, when her eyes caught on something over his shoulder. Brushing past him, she wandered over to the long wooden table, which was carved on all sides with intricate ivy. On the edge of the table sat a stack of books. Hermione stared at the spines.</p><p>“<em>Muggle </em> books?”</p><p>He cleared his throat. “Ah, those belong to a friend of mine. He often comes to study and research.”</p><p>“I see.” Hermione’s eyes narrowed, wondering which friend of Malfoy’s would be in possession of Muggle literature. Her fingers stroked the spines of the stack. Dostoyevsky, Aristotle, Sun Tzu, Dante, Tolstoy… Who was this philosophical friend of Malfoy’s?</p><p>"Why would he leave these books here?"</p><p>Malfoy looked a bit hesitant to elaborate but answered her saying, "I believe he intends to return for them later this evening. More research, I suppose." </p><p>At that moment, Dobby appeared with a resounding crack. Hermione started again, jerked from her wonderings by the house elf. </p><p>“Master Malfoy’s friends Master Avery and Master Macnair is waiting in the drawing room, sir. They is saying they is urgently needing to talk with Master Malfoy.”</p><p>“Very well, Dobby,” Abraxas muttered, his brows drawing forward. “Will you please excuse me for just a moment, Miss Dumbledore? I shall return shortly. Although, I’m sure, you can find something to occupy your time in my absence.” He gestured around him, with a brilliant flash of teeth, to the infinite amount of books. </p><p>“However shall I quell the boredom?” She grinned wickedly back at him.</p><p>Laughter rumbled in his chest as he made his way out of the library.</p><p>Hermione returned her attention to the stack of books on the table. On the very top of the stack was an older book, entitled <em>Ancient Charms for the Advanced Wizard</em>. </p><p>“Or <em>witch</em>,” she muttered wryly. She picked it up and noticed that it had a paper wedged in between its pages. She flipped the book open and lay it on its spine, examining the paper.</p><p>Of a sudden, her blood ran cold. She knew instantly <em>who</em> Malfoy's friend was. Her heart beat swiftly at the thought that she had probably just missed his presence in the library. The paper was torn from a book, apparently a book of muggle poetry. She read the lines quickly, her eyes darting back and forth frantically. </p><p> </p><p>
<b>Invictus by William Ernest Henley</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Out of the night that covers me, </em>
</p><p>
<em>       Black as the pit from pole to pole, </em>
</p><p>
<em> I thank whatever gods may be </em>
</p><p>
<em>       For my unconquerable soul. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> In the fell clutch of circumstance </em>
</p><p>
<em>       I have not winced nor cried aloud. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Under the bludgeonings of chance </em>
</p><p>
<em>       My head is bloody, but unbowed. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Beyond this place of wrath and tears </em>
</p><p>
<em>       Looms but the Horror of the shade, </em>
</p><p>
<em> And yet the menace of the years </em>
</p><p>
<em>       Finds and shall find me unafraid. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> It matters not how strait the gate, </em>
</p><p>
<em>       How charged with punishments the scroll, </em>
</p><p>
<em> I am the master of my fate, </em>
</p><p>
<em>       I am the captain of my soul.<br/><br/></em>
</p><p>A shiver ran down her spine. It felt as though she was reading Voldemort’s very own mission statement, his soul sprawled out on a paper and summed up by these condensed lines of poetry.<br/><br/></p><p>
<em> In the fell clutch of circumstance… Under the bludgeonings of chance…<br/><br/></em>
</p><p>“Definitely the unsavory circumstances of his birth and childhood,” Hermione muttered.<br/><br/></p><p>
<em> It matters not how strait the gate, how charged with punishments the scroll…<br/><br/></em>
</p><p>“Of course, because all his murders and evil deeds only serve to further his cause. It’s all justified, in his mind,” she whispered with no small amount of disgust.<br/><br/></p><p>
<em> I thank whatever gods may be, for my unconquerable soul…<br/><br/></em>
</p><p>“His horcruxes,” she whispered reverently.<br/><br/></p><p>
<em> I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul.<br/><br/></em>
</p><p>It seemed almost like a vow. Tom Riddle would never allow his circumstances to mold his fate; he would achieve power and change his situation by whatever means necessary.</p><p>Hermione could imagine a young Tom Riddle being fascinated by this work of muggle literature. If she’d learned anything about Voldemort, it’s that he had an almost poetic sense of significance about life. He was almost… sentimental, in a sick and twisted, sociopathic kind of way. The way he desperately desired heirlooms from the Hogwarts founders, the place he considered to be <em> home </em> … so much so that he was willing to devote <em> years </em> solely to the search of them. The way he hid the diadem in the room of requirement, the ring in the Gaunt shack. She wondered what kind of significance the fountain pen had. But of course, that’s where the word Invictus had come from. He’d turned it into the incantation for the time travel instrument he’d created. But what was the purpose of the object? Who had he meant it for? The questions burned in Hermione’s mind.</p><p>She carefully placed the paper back in its place, but noted that the paper was being used as a bookmark. She looked at the place in the book he’d been saving, then she smirked and nearly rolled her eyes. <em> The Protean Charm </em> . He was trying to find a way to create his Dark Mark. She knew that the enchanted tattoos had been created using an altered variation of the Protean Charm. So his Death Eaters <em> weren’t </em> all branded, <em> yet </em>. It would only be a matter of time before Tom figured it out and forced all of his followers to take the mark.</p><p>As predictable as Voldemort was, she was still surprised by him. Then again, perhaps he only seemed predictable because she already knew what his moves would be. She was from the future, after all. She chuckled to herself, thinking that she could surely make a living as a seer if journalism didn’t pan out.</p><p>No, Voldemort was actually pretty creative and ingenious, she had to admit. He certainly had a singleness of eye, and a laser-focused dedication to his goals.</p><p>Hermione put the book down and slid another book from the stack. The Art of War by Sun Tzu. Of <em> course </em> , he had studied military strategy. He was a master manipulator, after all. Hermione wasn’t sure why she thought Tom Riddle had simply woken up one morning and decided to become a raving, lunatical mass murderer. To have won over so many powerful followers, to the point where even the ministry was under his control, an entire population of people fearing to even <em> speak his name </em>… Of course, he would have put years of thought and planning into his methods.</p><p>She casually opened the book and began to flip through its pages, noting that he had underlined, bulleted, and starred many of the lines in the book. She read a few pages, then stopped short as she noticed a word scribbled next to a particular quote. </p><p>
<em> To not prepare is the greatest of crimes; to be prepared beforehand for any contingency is the greatest of virtues. </em>
</p><p>Beside the quote, in the margins, he’d scrawled the word “tempaestus.” It was the same spiky penmanship that had been written on the scroll in the black leather box.</p><p>Tempaestus? What on earth did it mean?</p><p>She made a mental note to research it at length when she returned to Godric’s Hollow.</p><p>Suddenly, she heard the sound of the door opening, so she dropped the book back to the stack and hurriedly put the books back as they’d been when she found them.</p><p>She turned to find Abraxas Malfoy striding toward her, a look of preoccupation on his face.</p><p>“I beg your forgiveness, Miss Dumbledore, but it seems I must go out. My presence is required at the Ministry, so unfortunately we will have to postpone our tea.”</p><p>She smiled. “No matter, I relish the opportunity to return to your beautiful manor. I should love nothing better than to have tea with you and peruse these lovely books at a later date.”</p><p>His eyes met hers and he smiled, seemingly pleased by her response. He bowed deeply, taking her hand in his to press his lips to her skin. His lips lingered there for a moment before he straightened. “I’m afraid I won’t be able to escort you beyond the gate to the apparition point, as time is of the essence. There are blood wards on the estate that prevent apparition, but Dobby will be able to apparate you directly back to your home. Dobby!”</p><p>The house elf appeared with a loud crack, but this time, Hermione was better prepared for the noise. </p><p>“See that Miss Dumbledore gets back to her home safely.” He grinned at her as he turned to leave. “Look for my formal invitation by owl. I look forward to being your escort to Ostara.”</p><p>Before she could reply, Dobby had taken her hand and turned on his heel, and they disappeared.</p><p> </p><p align="center">

</p><p> </p><p>Hermione sat outside in the gardens of Dumbedore’s cottage, under a lovely wooden arbor woven artfully with a thick vine of roses. Her easily-tanned skin was sun-kissed and rosy from her frequent tending to the garden. She wore a simple yellow sundress, one of the latest French designs that would become a staple fashion of the 1950s. She had always preferred the fashion of the 20s, 30s, and 40s to the styles of her own time. There was something incredibly romantic about the well-tailored garments of the era, painstakingly crafted and sewn with quality fabrics and not at all mass-produced, so for once in her life, Hermione had begun to take an interest in fashion. She had dipped into her coffers only to discover that Draco had designated <em> hundreds </em> of thousands of Galleons in her name. She doubted she could spend that much coin in her whole life! </p><p>So, for the sake of appearing like the well-to-do pureblood witch she was pretending to be, she’d embarked on a shopping spree of epic proportions. She bought dresses, heels, boots, silk gloves, and stylish hats. She purchased an exquisite enchanted silver filigree mirror and brush set, and full-sized bottles of Miss Dior and Nina Ricci’s L’Air du Temps. Hermione invested in a small chest full of exotic French lingerie, because it made Hermione feel mature and confident. She purchased handbags, little golden compacts of makeup, tubes of red and maroon lipsticks, a knife sheath for her thigh, and an arm holster for her wand. She’d never known herself to be so indulgent, but she decided that a new identity required a new wardrobe.</p><p>In addition to all of these splurges, <em> Madam Malkin’s </em> and <em> Twillfit and Tattings </em> had gifted her with an obscene amount of dress robes. She’d seen the parcels floating between no less than <em> nine </em> owls. The robes were the newest styles, still unreleased, and packaged beautifully in floral printed boxes with dried nightshade petals and shimmering tissue paper. They’d written her a lovely note, congratulating her on her new position at The Daily Prophet, and encouraged her to wear the styles in photo opportunities and press events. In essence, they hoped that the <em> highly talked about </em> daughter of the famous Albus Dumbledore would be seen wearing their latest designs. </p><p>Hermione was now a trendsetter. How <em> bizarre </em>.</p><p>During her latest visit to Inga Eidelburg’s beauty salon, <em> Bewitched! </em> , she’d been informed that little girls were entering her salon in droves requesting Volumizing potions and <em> Counterfeit Curls </em>charms to be performed on their hair, producing Hermione Dumbledore’s photos in The Daily Prophet as examples.</p><p>Her frizzy hair had now become <em> en vogue </em>.</p><p>How utterly ironic.</p><p>Hermione gave a wry smile as she set out the teapot, tea cups, and raspberry scones she had whipped up earlier that morning. She had cast a stasis charm on them, so they were still hot and steaming as Dumbledore apparated soundlessly into the back gardens.</p><p>It was Sunday, and she was well-prepared for tea with her surrogate father.</p><p>“Good afternoon, Miss Granger,” Dumbledore said politely.</p><p>“Please call me Hermione, Headmaster.”</p><p>“Only if you will agree to call me Albus.”</p><p>“Touché, Albus. How has your week been?”</p><p>“Quite eventful. I’ve been called to the Wizengamot for a trial this week. More dark wizards to deal with, I’m afraid. Followers of Grindelwald. I would ask you how your week has been, but I can see that you’ve been quite busy. I’ve enjoyed reading your very inspired writings in <em> The Daily Prophet. </em>”</p><p>Hermione blushed, then gave a wry smile. “I hope I’m not giving the Dumbledore name a bad reputation or causing you any problems… I know my articles are a bit shocking and progressive.”</p><p>Dumbledore eyed her kindly. “Hermione, I think you’re doing the Dumbledore name better justice than any of us Dumbledores have over the years. Continue to do what you feel is right, Hermione.”</p><p>“Thank you, sir.”</p><p>“Now, I think we should get started with your occlumency lessons, either this week or next. That is... if you have the time. I think it very imperative that we begin.”</p><p>“I agree. In fact, I would love for you to teach me any advanced magic that you think would be necessary, or helpful at all. Although, I was hoping we might start next week. I’m to attend a ball tonight and I’ve got to pick up my dress before it gets too late.”</p><p>“A ball? How charming. Where is this ball?”</p><p>She rubbed her lips together, feeling a bit chagrined. “Well… it is at Malfoy Manor.”</p><p>“<em> Oh </em>,” said Dumbledore with surprise, eyeing her carefully. “And is this ball part of your covert operation to change future events?”</p><p>“It is, sir.”</p><p>He nodded, thoughtful. “Are you attending with anyone?”</p><p>She paused. “Abraxas Malfoy is escorting me.”</p><p>He appeared concerned. “Do be careful, Hermione. I feel I must warn you about someone. One of my former students, in fact. His name is Tom Riddle. There are things about the boy that I feel that I cannot explain at the present time, but I feel he is dangerous. You may meet him there… he was close with Abraxas Malfoy, in his school days.”</p><p>She did her best to keep a straight face so as not to give anything away. “I will keep an eye out for him, sir. I’ll be very careful. I did many dangerous things in the future, for the cause of the war. I can handle myself, Albus.”</p><p>He nodded, somewhat appeased. Hermione wondered if he had brought up Tom simply to gauge her reaction. He likely already suspected that the future Dark Wizard was Tom himself. She hoped she hadn’t given it away.</p><p>Hermione and Albus sat for the next half hour, drinking hot tea and eating scones, and enjoying the blissful quiet of one another’s company. Hermione thought to herself that this was the kind of future she would have hoped for, if the war hadn’t happened. This was the kind of peace she wanted to secure for others. For Fred. Remus &amp; Tonks. Harry’s parents. Sirius. Lavender. So many countless people.</p><p>All she had to do… was destroy Tom Riddle.</p><hr/><p> </p><p>Despite her best efforts, Hermione was late getting ready, but she decided it was smart to be fashionably late to the ball anyway. </p><p>Dobby had apparated into the cottage to escort her to the ball, care of Abraxas Malfoy, but Hermione had assured him that she would need some extra time and instructed him to wait for her in the parlor.</p><p>Hermione had selected a set of velvet formal robes of blue-grey, the neckline of which plunged daringly in a tasteful display of skin and elegant collarbone. The twilight-colored fabric was bedecked with little stars and moons, enchanted gemstones that twinkled and glistened iridescently. The result was quite breathtaking, and she knew that Madam Malkin would be pleased that she had worn the elegant creation she had designed distinctly for her.</p><p>Inga Eidelberg had artfully coiffed Hermione’s hair into a striking updo, her usually thick and frizzy hair now tamed, french-braided, and coiled loosely with wispy tendrils and curls framing her face.</p><p>Hermione swept a deep mauve shade of lip color over her lips and cast a charm that mimicked makeup. She clasped the golden phoenix necklace around her neck, her birthday gift from Ron, as a reminder of the purpose of her mission tonight. As she stared at it in the mirror, she felt a pang of loneliness.</p><p>She missed Ron and Harry terribly. She missed her parents.</p><p>Unless she could discover the key to the time travel enchantment from Voldemort himself (not likely) she would never be able to go back home.</p><p>The only thing that kept the tears from welling up in Hermione’s eyes was the steely determination that she would, in fact, bring Voldemort down and make a better life for her friends and family in the future. She could save them all from death, trauma, and fear. </p><p>She assessed herself once more in the mirror and admitted to herself that she did feel rather beautiful in this particular ensemble.</p><p>She checked that her knife was sheathed in her thigh holster, and ensured that her wand was safely attached to her other thigh, hidden beneath the folds of her gown.</p><p>Then Hermione took a Calming Draught to settle her nerves and allowed Dobby to apparate her into Malfoy Manor.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Abraxas came to meet her promptly at the entrance to the ballroom, having been waiting patiently for her arrival. His eyes immediately roamed over her, beginning with her hair, then her face, then slowly made a sweep down her figure. His gaze lingered on the expanse of skin visible just over her breastbone and then eyed the enchanted gemstones on her dress. Hermione blushed deep red at this slow appraisal, but Abraxas only grinned at her and offered her his arm, which she took with nervous trepidation.</p><p>As he led her into the ballroom, which was crawling with guests, he leaned close to her and whispered in her ear, “You are remarkably beautiful, Miss Dumbledore. Truly enchanting. I’ll be lucky if I get to dance with you at all tonight. They’ll all be lining up, I fear.”</p><p>She bit her lip, feeling a little too moved by his praise. </p><p>He greeted a few acquaintances and ministry officials, introducing them to the sensational Hermione Dumbledore. </p><p>“You must relax,” Abraxas murmured, sensing her tense composure. “I’m your escort, and I won’t let the big bad wolves bite you.”</p><p>She laughed under her breath at his allusion to their prior conversation. She found herself feeling quite at ease on Abraxas’ arm and she wasn’t sure if that was a good thing or not. She glanced about, unwittingly searching for a tall figure with black hair.</p><p>She didn’t see Tom Riddle anywhere.</p><p>Resigning herself that he may not be the type to attend these types of events, she allowed Abraxas to lift a glass of champagne from a nearby tray and hand it to her gallantly; she took it from his gloved hands and their fingers brushed. Hermione also noted that Abraxas carried a cane similar to the one his son Lucius had. She knew his wand would also be concealed within it.</p><p>“Miss Dumbledore! How pleasant it is to see you again. You look positively stunning, my dear.”</p><p>Hermione turned and came face to face with the Minister for Magic, Leonard Spencer-Moon. He was nearing the end of his term, and she could tell by his graying hair and withered face that he was quite ready for retirement. He genuinely looked battle-weary, having presided over the Global Wizarding War, and by extension, the muggle World War as well.</p><p>“Minister Moon, what a pleasure!” Hermione reached her hand out for a handshake, but the older gentleman pulled her in for a hug instead.</p><p>“Quite, quite, but what on earth are you doing on the arm of this poor sod?” He clapped Malfoy on the shoulder; the two apparently had a friendly sort of camaraderie.</p><p>“This beguiling witch has graciously allowed me to be her escort for the evening, Minister. An honor I am not worthy of, but am <em> most </em> grateful for, all the same.”</p><p>“Better keep an eye on this one, Hermione, he’s got a silver tongue.”</p><p>She laughed and gave Malfoy a reproachful glance. “So I’ve <em> noticed</em>, sir.”</p><p>The Minister threw his head back and guffawed. “She’s got your number, old chap! By the way, Miss Dumbledore, allow me to congratulate you on your success at The Daily Prophet. Your articles are quite moving and beautifully written.” He cast a glance at Malfoy. “It would be wise for other wizarding families in this society to catch on to the growth of these modern times. The way of the future is understanding and equality, not fear and exclusion. Wouldn’t you agree, Malfoy?”</p><p>Abraxas swallowed and gave him a tight smile. “Undeniably, Minister.” Malfoy’s eyes lifted and he appeared to be gazing at something in the distance. Hermione followed his line of sight, and that’s when she caught sight of him.</p><p>Tom Riddle was on the second level, just past the staircase, hands planted on the marble balustrade, watching the proceedings in the ballroom like an overlord observing his subjects.</p><p>Her mouth fell slightly open as she took in his appearance. His dark curls fell over his forehead, contrasting sharply against his pale skin. He wore black from head to toe, making the gold buckles of his formal robes glint menacingly. He looked every bit like the black viper that he was.</p><p>She averted her eyes before he caught her staring. Her heart began to race as she realized the inevitability of their meeting tonight. How would she explain her abrupt reaction when they’d collided in Diagon Alley? Hermione felt a rush of anxiety and it flushed her cheeks pink. </p><p>This was why she’d come. She wouldn’t chicken out now. This was the purpose of her attendance at this ball, and she had every intention of executing her plan to perfection. </p><p>After all, he was nothing but a blasted shopboy. She was the daughter of Albus Dumbledore, and besides that, she was <em> Hermione Granger</em>, a war hero. She and her friends had defeated him in the end. She had no reason whatsoever to be intimidated by Tom Riddle.</p><p>“Miss Dumbledore,” Abraxas said warmly. “May I introduce you to some of my colleagues?” She hadn’t realized that Malfoy had been guiding her over to a particular group of people. He gestured to a few of the faces lingering in a loose circle around them. He introduced them one by one, and they each shook her hand and bowed gallantly, but she could discern their attitudes toward her by their faces. They were <em>not </em>impressed by her last name or her <em>progressive </em>views. “This is William Avery… Charles Mcnair… Maximillian Dolohov… Darius Rookwood… Ida and Cora Greengrass… Acacius Nott… Orin Mulciber… Ragnor Lestrange… Cygnus Black… ahem, <em> Walburga </em> Black…”</p><p>A pale, black-haired witch looked Hermione up and down with a scathing glare, shooting daggers at her. She was on the arm of a man named Cygnus Black, whom Hermione realized was her brother, as she recalled their names from the Black family tapestry at Grimmauld Place. Hermione noted that the witch on his arm was very beautiful, with full red lips and cat-like blue eyes. Her waving black hair fell past her waist, which was trim despite her voluptuous figure. She did not offer any greeting, but Hermione found she was hardly surprised. Walburga was Sirius’ and Regulus’ mother, after all, and she had blotted her own son’s name out of the family tree for being a  “blood-traitor.” So Hermione could hardly imagine the woman would deign to be civil given her recent articles in <em> The Daily Prophet</em>.</p><p>The conversation was stilted at best. It was strange for Hermione to see the <em>original </em>group of Death Eaters, the ancestors of the Death Eaters that had almost ruined Hermione’s life. They seemed much less deranged than the latter group; slightly more civilized. Voldemort’s Death Eaters cast glances at one another, and it was apparent they were very uncomfortable in her presence.</p><p>Tensions loosened somewhat when the wine and spirits began to flow. They all proceeded to share stories about Hogwarts, which Hermione questioned them about. </p><p>“I regrettably missed out on that rather poignant experience so it's clear I must live vicariously through you all. I hope you don’t mind,” Hermione said, eliciting some laughs. </p><p>“Hogwarts was brilliant, absolutely brilliant,” Malfoy boasted. “We snuck around, drinking elf-made wine, playing Quidditch, terrorizing the house elves… we cheated on Gillywick’s exams and swam naked in the Black Lake… don’t mention that one to my mother, Miss Dumbledore,” he muttered conspiratorially. “She would faint and desperately need to be rennervated.”</p><p>“Abraxas was an incredible quidditch player… very skilled seeker,” said Ida Greengrass as the pretty blonde witch batted her eyelashes at him.</p><p>“I come from a long line of Slytherin seekers… it was only natural. I think my father might’ve actually disowned me if I hadn’t been made seeker.”</p><p>“Yes, but <em>you </em>set records,” she praised.</p><p>“Tell us,” Macnair interrupted somewhat acidly. “What was it like growing up, homeschooled, in <em> Edinburgh </em>?”</p><p>“Well,” she began demurely. “I certainly deplore that I missed out on what could’ve been a dazzling Quidditch career.” A few of them chuckled. “I’m afraid I was a bit of a bookworm. There’s really not much to say about it. I spent all of my time reading and perfecting spells and charms.”</p><p>“I’ve heard you are related to the Dagworth-Grangers. They’re famous potioneers are they not? A well-known family.” asked Avery.</p><p>Hermione nodded. “Oh yes, they are, but I fear I’m only mildly proficient in potions. Apparently, I didn’t get the stroke of potioneering genius from that branch of the family.”</p><p>“I think you are far too modest, Miss Dumbledore,” said Abraxas softly. “Your articles are very well-thought-out and heavily researched. One must possess a scholarly disposition to write so fluidly about such topics.” There were a few snickers. Hermione almost thought she saw Walburga roll her eyes.</p><p>She gazed at Malfoy and felt her heart warming to him marginally. “You are too kind, Mr. Malfoy.”</p><p>Malfoy’s eyes made contact with hers and she felt a genuine spark between them for a brief moment before his eyes blinked past her and focused on something over her shoulder. “Ah, Tom! I believe introductions are in order.”</p><p>Hermione turned to find Tom Riddle approaching, a glass of firewhiskey in hand. His eyes trained on her and his gaze spoke of a cold, detached sort of interest. He observed her for a moment and then smirked. “I do believe you owe me a handshake, Miss… <em> Dumbledore </em>.”</p><p>Abraxas looked from her to Tom with momentary confusion. </p><p>“<em> Oh… But of course! </em> Tom!” she laughed, feigning recognition. “The man I so <em> rudely </em> crashed into in Diagon Alley!”</p><p>Tom’s face fell for a moment, his brows furrowed and eyes narrowed as they roamed her face. His expression shifted only for a moment, but still, she caught the look of surprise, though she wasn’t sure what she had said to warrant such a reaction.</p><p>“Indeed,” Tom replied in a smooth, rich timbre. “You were loathe to tell me your surname, so much so that you ran away from me as if I had the plague. I found it very bizarre.”</p><p>“Forgive me, I’m sure it came across as quite rude. Allow me to remedy the situation.” She held out her hand. “Hermione Dumbledore, sir.”</p><p>Tom looked at her outstretched hand for a moment, then lifted his eyes to hers. He searched her warm brown eyes for a moment before taking her hand. “Tom. Tom Riddle.”</p><p>She felt cold metal against her finger and looked down at their interlocked hands to see a thick gold ring with a black stone on his finger. The Gaunt ring. His second horcrux. She wished she could vanish it from his finger without his noticing.</p><p>Abraxas and the entire group of Death Eaters were watching this interaction carefully, in mute silence.</p><p>Hermione tried not to flinch at the personal contact with the murderer. She felt as though she were watching herself from outside her body. She pulled her hand away as soon as she was able to without seeming rude. “I <em> was </em> truthful, however, I had somewhere to be. I was late on that particular day. In fact, I was on my way to meet with my father.”</p><p>“Right. Headmaster Dumbledore. Strange, don’t you think? Dumbledore has a daughter who seemingly materializes out of thin air.” Tom watched her closely.</p><p>Hermione met his stare boldly. “It <em>is </em>strange. I’m still getting used to the fact myself. I <em> would </em> say it’s the most eccentric thing to ever happen to me, but that wouldn’t be the truth.”</p><p>He cocked his head to the side in a serpentine movement. “Tell me, then. What is the most eccentric thing to ever have happened to you?”</p><p>“Hmm,” she pretended to think, then landed on a cheeky idea. “What would you say to playing a game instead, Mr. Riddle? I’ll make an <em> outlandish </em> claim, and you can decide if its true or false?”</p><p>His eyes narrowed slightly. “Will you tell me if I’m correct?”</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>He locked eyes with her, and she felt lost in their bottomless black depths. “Very well, Miss Dumbledore. Proceed.”</p><p>She flashed him a grin. “I once rode a dragon.”</p><p>The other members of his party exchanged looks and whispers.</p><p>She suddenly felt something brush up against her mental walls. She recognized his attempt at legilimency, and hurried to fortify her occlumency shields. His eyes met hers as she arched an eyebrow questioningly, an amused smile playing on her lips. She felt when he retreated and sensed frustration in the tensing of his jaw. His smile, however, never wavered. “True.”</p><p>She inclined her head demurely. “And you are correct.”</p><p>“Goodness, that must’ve been something,” exclaimed Abraxas. His hand moved to rest on her lower back in an attempt to refocus her energy back on him.</p><p>“Certainly it was,” she murmured, slightly uncomfortable with his sudden invasive touch.</p><p>Malfoy leaned closer. “I’d like to hear about that sometime.”</p><p>Tom’s lips twitched. “What else?”</p><p>Hermione took a sip of champagne and remarked casually, “I fought a dark wizard.”</p><p>His eyes narrowed slightly, his lips turning up in amusement. “Somehow, given your father’s own propensity for dueling dark wizards, I find myself imagining that it’s true.” </p><p>She shrugged and tilted her head to the side. “Then I killed him.”</p><p>Gasps and more whispers. Abraxas and Avery glanced at Tom.</p><p>Tom didn’t flinch. His gaze was steady as he matched her stare. His magic pressed gently against her occlumency walls again, but she successfully blocked him out. “True.”</p><p>“Bravo, sir. You’re right,” she murmured softly.</p><p>He smiled, but it didn’t reach his eyes. “I have a sort of… <em>gift</em>, you might say, for discerning when someone is lying. Call it a sixth sense, if you will.”</p><p>Silence. No whispers this time. Nott, Avery, Rosier, and Mulciber stared soberly between the two of them. Dolohov glared at her, as did Walburga. The Greengrass sisters sipped their champagne.</p><p>“Cheers,” Tom said, lifting his glass. His lips curved into a devastatingly handsome smile.</p><p>Hermione lifted hers coyly. “To catching dark wizards.”</p><p>He tilted his head, contemplating her as they both sipped their drinks. “Do tell me, what other eccentric adventures have you had, Miss Dumbledore?”</p><p>She took a deep breath. “I broke into Gringotts.”</p><p>He laughed. “Absolutely false.”</p><p>She bit her bottom lip, and his eyes tracked the movement. “Why do you say that?”</p><p>“Goblins are completely mad creatures. Besides, that certainly would have made the front pages of <em> The Prophet</em>. Although it seems you’re making the front page <em> enough </em> as it is.”</p><p>She smiled at that. “Perhaps I was never caught.”</p><p>He cocked his head sharply, betraying his interest. “How would you have accomplished such a feat?”</p><p>“<em> That </em> I cannot divulge,” she grinned deviously. Abraxas cleared his throat.</p><p>Tom smirked at her, his black eyes boring into her as if he could see through to her soul. “You said you would tell me if I was correct.”</p><p>“Yes, but I never said I would tell you if you were wrong.”</p><p>His eyes narrowed. “Conceded. Now I’m curious about your thoughts on goblins and Gringotts. You seem to give your opinions very decidedly, so I’m sure you have one.”</p><p>She shrugged. “I’ve always said there should be other financial institutions. For such <em>intelligent </em>and <em>superior </em>wizards... only one bank? The muggles have countless banks, and not all this heavy, cumbersome gold. All our gold in one place? How silly. It’s not wise to put all your eggs in one basket, so the muggles say. It might be easier than you think to break in, after all. Then where would wizard-kind be? Up the creek without a paddle… as the <em> muggles </em> say.” She tossed Abraxas a wink.</p><p>Walburga Black glared daggers at her.</p><p>Abraxas, firmly planted at Hermione’s side, chuckled, “I have no doubt you’re probably right about that, Hermione. You seem to have given it a fair bit of thought.”</p><p>She laughed. “Perhaps I was a bank robber in a past life.”</p><p>Something seemed to spark Tom’s interest. “Would you care to dance, Miss Dumbledore?”</p><p>Her eyes flicked to his, but his expression was unreadable. His elegant, long-fingered hand was held out in invitation, and when she took it, she noted it was warm and strong as his fingers wrapped around hers.</p><p>He placed his other hand on her waist as she rested hers on his shoulder. He pulled her quite close, and her breath caught as his scent filled her nostrils. He smelled of oud wood, cedar, bergamot, and amber. The combination was intoxicating, and she was painfully aware of his hand on her waist. “Do you believe in past lives, Miss Dumbledore?”</p><p>She glanced at him and found him regarding her closely as he lead her expertly across the floor. Thank goodness she’d learned to waltz in fourth year. “Truthfully? I never did. Nor fate, or destiny. Nor divination, for that matter. But events that have recently occurred may have shifted my attitude slightly.”</p><p>“We may have that in common, then. The topic might make for an interesting article for your column.”</p><p>She glanced at him, surprise tinting her features. “Do you read it, Mr. Riddle?”</p><p>His eyes met hers and they were icy, full of disdain. “I do when I can spare the time. I imagine the whole of Britain is curious to read the words of <em>Hermione</em> <em>Dumbledore</em>.”</p><p>“I suppose I’m glad to know I have a decent readership.”</p><p>“Most certainly. You’re making quite a splash with your… <em> progressive </em> views.”</p><p>She bit back her irritation, but couldn’t keep from pursing her lips slightly, lifting her chin a notch, and flushing light pink. “You mean my views on muggle relations.”</p><p>His eyes roamed her face. “That would be one of them.”</p><p>“You’ll have to forgive me, but I hardly subscribe to the outdated ideals of my pureblood contemporaries. My mother loved muggles. She raised me around them. Had them over for tea.” She shot him an impish smile.</p><p>She noticed that Abraxas Malfoy was glaring at them as they spun around the ballroom. </p><p>“What a surprise, then, it must have been to discover your biological father to be a famous wizard. Convenient, really.”</p><p>She sputtered, gobsmacked. “Do you think of one’s paternal lineage in terms of convenience, <em> sir </em>?”</p><p>He considered her, noting her disbelief. “As it happens, my own turned out to be quite <em>inconvenient</em>. He certainly wasn’t winning any “Father of the Year” awards, so you’ll have to forgive my mild distaste for muggles. I certainly have no fond memories of my muggle upbringing.”</p><p>She allowed her eyes to roam his face. He was quite skilled at keeping his expressions hidden beneath a polite mask, but she could tell his eyes snapped with irritation. “That’s unfortunate. I could offer that perhaps you have only seen one side of their society. It is unfair to judge an entire race by a narrow set of experiences.”</p><p>“I don’t disagree, but I’m far more content with my lot in the wizarding world, as it stands.”</p><p>“<em> Are </em> you though?”</p><p>He narrowed his eyes imperceptibly. “What are you hinting at, Miss Dumbledore?”</p><p>She gave him a wide-eyed glance. “Forgive me, I wasn’t implying anything, the question was quite innocent. I’m not yet well-adjusted to social interactions in pureblood society, so you must forgive me if anything I say comes across rude.”</p><p> </p><p>——————-</p><p> </p><p><em> Lies</em>. <em> How curious</em>. </p><p>Tom smiled politely but it didn’t reach his eyes. “No, not at all. I’ll admit, I find it refreshing. Allow me to be uncouth myself. May I ask how old you are?”</p><p>She cleared her throat. “Nineteen.”</p><p>His eyebrows lifted. “Quite young. You comport yourself as one much older.”</p><p> “Young in years, yes.”</p><p>He smirked. She noted how attractive the expression was on his perfectly-proportioned lips, and she had to remind herself that he was a pretty murderer. “Are you implying that you’re wise beyond your years?”</p><p>She didn’t reply as their dance was coming to an end. Riddle took her hand in his and led her back to the widening circle of his party. He lifted a glass of champagne from a tray floating nearby and handed it to her. Abraxas approached them again, placing his arm possessively around her shoulder. She gave him a tiny smile of greeting. </p><p>She glanced up at Tom to find his gaze intent upon her. “To answer your question, Mr. Riddle, I hope so. Perhaps I have inherited some of my father’s brilliancy and Gryffindor acumen.”</p><p>“Ah,” interjected Abraxas, “But we would much rather have you in Slytherin.”</p><p>She gazed around the loose circle of purebloods. “Were you <em> all </em> in Slytherin?”</p><p>Abraxas grinned devilishly. “All of us. Every one.”</p><p>She laughed dubiously and took a deep sip of champagne. “How fearsome! I seem to have found myself in a pit of vipers.”</p><p>“Don’t worry, Hermione,” Abraxas murmured teasingly, his arm moving from her shoulders to her waist. “I’ll keep you quite safe from them. I won’t let the wolves <em> or </em> the vipers bite.”</p><p>Tom hadn’t stopped watching her. He took a sip of his firewhiskey. “Oh, I don’t know, Abraxas. I have a feeling she’s a bit of a viper, herself.”</p><p>She met his gaze, but he was staring daggers at Abraxas. “I <em> was </em>sorted at Hogwarts, actually. It was a bit of a joke, really. My father and I have been making up for lost time. Getting to know one another better, and all that. I was at Hogwarts to take my NEWTs and he assured me that the <em>best </em>way to determine if I was <em>really </em>his daughter was to let the sorting hat select my house! He assured me no daughter of <em>his </em>would be <em>anything less </em>than a Gryffindor. We had a good laugh about it.”</p><p>Tom observed her with one eyebrow raised. “And were you?”</p><p>She looked up. “Excuse me?</p><p>“Sorted. Into Gryffindor,” he smirked.</p><p>She smoothed her dress nervously. “Naturally.”</p><p>He snickered. “But how did you fare in your NEWTS?”</p><p>She met his eyes as she sipped her champagne, giving him a coy smile. “All outstandings.”</p><p>His other eyebrow lifted. “Impressive.”</p><p>She inclined her head in acknowledgment. </p><p>“Particularly for a witch who was <em> homeschooled.</em>” She didn’t miss the hint of accusation in his tone.</p><p>Her eyes met his and she could read suspicion in them. </p><p>Abraxas again intervened. “That’s quite a compliment coming from Tom, Miss Dumbledore. Tom was head boy, and also received all O’s on his NEWTs.”</p><p>“Delightful.” Her laughter tinkled charmingly, and she once more noted the tense look on Riddle’s face. Every time she laughed. <em> Interesting</em>. “Perhaps we could mentally spar sometime, Mr. Riddle.”</p><p>“Perhaps, we could <em> duel</em>.” His grin was sinister. Several heads turned their way.</p><p>“Would you like that? I must say, being homeschooled, I may have learnt a few curses that weren’t approved by your Hogwarts curriculum.”</p><p>His eyes lit with vague interest, and she thought she caught a flash of crimson in them. “What curses might those be, Miss Dumbledore?”</p><p>“Please, call me Hermione.” Abraxas’ brow furrowed sharply at their interaction, as their conversation had become quite separate from the rest of the group.</p><p>“What curses, <em> Hermione</em>?” He said it with a warm inflection and an intimate tilt of his head that brought pink to her cheeks.</p><p>Walburga Black’s glare was now frozen over with ice.</p><p>“Pardon me, Mr. Riddle, but what kind of duelist would I be if I gave away my secrets?”</p><p>His lips twitched. “You make me eager to find out.”</p><p>“Although… head boy <em>and </em>all outstandings? I pray I don’t find myself in over my head with you, sir.”</p><p>Hermione realized she was being cheeky and a bit flirty, which she supposed she could contribute to the champagne, but she knew that she also needed to catch his interest if she was to execute her plans.</p><p>It was proving to be remarkably easy to talk to him, after all, not at all what she would have expected of a fledgling dark lord.</p><p>He flashed a brilliant grin. “I would take it easy on you. What with you being Dumbledore’s daughter and all? Wouldn’t want to find myself at the end of his wand, would I?”</p><p>She smiled sweetly and took a sip of champagne. “Who knows? You might one day.”</p><p>His eyes narrowed and locked with hers. She stared back challengingly.</p><p>Abraxas shifted, uncomfortable with the building tension between them.  “Hermione, might I request a dance? I have yet to make an appearance on the floor, and my mother will be sorely injured if I don’t make an appearance with at least <em> one </em> eligible witch on my arm tonight.” Abraxas extended his hand with a bow and a dazzling smile.</p><p>She laughed as she broke eye contact with Tom Riddle to place her hand in Malfoy’s. She noted that it was soft and uncalloused.</p><p>“Do excuse us, Mr. Riddle. I must heroically save your friend from a verbal <em> lashing </em>.”</p><p>Tom inclined his head, watching her with no small amount of suspicion and a slight touch of intrigue. His gaze darkened as his friend guided the amusing witch onto the ballroom floor.</p><p>
<em> Intriguing, Hermione Whoever-You-Are.  </em>
</p><p><em> Quite Intriguing</em>.<br/><br/></p><hr/><p> </p><p>“You’ll have to forgive Tom, he can be a little intense sometimes. Don’t let him intimidate,” Abraxas murmured as they twirled about the ballroom.</p><p>“Oh, but I can also be intense, I’m afraid,” Hermione replied.</p><p>“On the contrary, I’m quite impressed with you, Hermione. Daughter of the Great Dumbledore, sharp-as-a-whip journalist, all <em> outstandings </em> on your NEWTs… You’re well-read and poised, beautiful, and quite witty as well, I might add. I feel as if I’ve dreamt you up.” </p><p>The blush that crept down Hermione’s neck was not at all feigned. “You flatter me, Mr. Malfoy, but I’ve been warned of your silver tongue.”</p><p>“Please, I implore you to call me Abraxas.”</p><p>Her eyelashes fluttered softly. “Very well, Abraxas.”</p><p>He gave her a wolfish grin. “My name sounds so <em> good </em> rolling off your tongue, Miss Dumbledore.”</p><p>Her expression was dubious. “If I didn’t already know you as a gentleman, I would think that sentence sounded quite inappropriate.”</p><p>“Forgive me,” he said solemnly, but he didn’t seem the least bit apologetic. “I find myself stumbling over my words in the presence of such a fetching witch. You’ve got me under a spell of some sort, I’m sure of it.”</p><p>She gave him a reproving glare. “Now, Mr. Malfoy, I’m sure you say that to all the young ladies.”</p><p>He smirked, lifting a finger to brush a stray lock of her hair from her cheek. “You may be right. Perhaps I do, but I only meant it when I said it to you.”</p><p>She laughed and then rolled her eyes. “Don’t I feel special…”</p><p>His expression was masked as he said, “You should. You <em> are </em> special, Miss Dumbledore.”</p><p>“You have my permission to call me Hermione.”</p><p>“It would be my absolute honor and privilege, <em> Hermione </em> .”<br/><br/></p><hr/><p> </p><p>Tom Riddle watched his Death Eater twirl Dumbledore’s daughter around the ballroom floor. Abraxas was flirting with her, he could tell. Tom watched with irritation as he brushed a stray hair away from her cheek.</p><p>Malfoy was a horny sod if he’d ever laid eyes on one. He would have to keep him on a proper leash, and he knew just how to do so.</p><p>Then again, Abraxas did have a level of charm that lulled people into a sense of comfort around him. Even he nearly fell for it sometimes. That could be useful because he wanted to know more about Hermione. He wanted to know more about her past and about her relationship with Dumbledore. He wanted to know if she was a capable duelist, or if she was at all magically gifted. He wanted to know if she was the type to be easily swayed by Malfoy’s brazen attentions. </p><p>He wanted to know what she was wearing underneath that gown...</p><p>He watched the pair of them and noted Hermione was laughing. </p><p><em> That laugh</em>.</p><p>He knew it the moment he’d heard her high, tinkling laughter. The same voice from his dreams. The one that had haunted him since the night he created the Tempaestus.</p><p>
<em> But why? Why her? </em>
</p><p>
<em> What did it mean? </em>
</p><p>He had half a mind to go see the <em>seer</em>. But he wasn’t that desperate for answers.</p><p>Yet.</p><p>He had his own, highly reliable tactics for uncovering the truth.</p><p>But she had such interesting views. They were her own, not simply regurgitated, baseless opinions. Despite the fact that her beliefs were in direct opposition to the views he espoused, he still felt no contention between them. Tension, perhaps, but not rivalry. He’d fully expected to hate her immediately, and yet, he merely found himself intrigued. Challenged, even.</p><p>He’d anticipated the witch to be stuffy, easily offended, dull, and temperamental. But she was not at all how he’d imagined her. She was light and airy, witty, mysterious, and refreshingly opinionated. She didn’t fall all over him, either, which Tom both liked and disliked.</p><p>In short, she was dangerous.</p><p>He wondered if she had really broken into Gringotts, and how she had done it.</p><p>He decided he didn’t believe her on that front.</p><p>And what would a homeschooled swot from Edinburgh be doing battling dark wizards and riding dragons?</p><p>Had she been toying with him the whole time?</p><p>His gaze found her once more and he noted that she had a rather refined sort of beauty. His eyes trailed her down her small nose, along her sharp jawline, down the slender column of her neck, then dragged over her pert chest and trim waist. </p><p>He ground his teeth in agitation and threw back the last of his firewhiskey.</p><p>He would discover her secrets, that much, Tom was sure of.</p><p>Now, enough of the bloody Gryffindor.</p><p><em> Bloody </em> Gryffindor, it had a nice ring to it.</p><p>She would look quite nice covered in blood. Red was her house color, after all.</p><p>He looked at his watch compulsively. It was almost time to attend a meeting of new recruits in the drawing room, and he needed a fucking cigarette.<br/><br/></p><hr/><p> </p><p>After their dance, Abraxas Malfoy brought Hermione out onto the balcony for some fresh air. He indicated that she could explore the gardens, which were lit by dancing fairies and moonlight, while he went to attend to some business in the drawing room. He’d assured her that he would try to hurry back, but she informed him that there was really no rush, that she was perfectly happy to explore on her own for a bit.</p><p>“I’m not much of a socialite, to be honest, so a breather would be nice,” she said shyly.</p><p>He’d kissed her hand tenderly, looking pained to have to leave her alone, and walked back inside.</p><p>Hermione stood gazing out at the gardens. The night was crisp and cool, lit by an opalescent moon that cast a bluish glow over the greenery below. There were expertly trimmed hedges, and rose bushes teeming with red and fuchsia blooms, most of which had only just begun to bud… the landscaping was truly breathtaking. The rush of water pouring from the fountain calmed her apprehension as she watched the tiny dancing lights of the fairies. The sound of the music from the ballroom below reached her distantly. </p><p>Hermione wondered to herself how different her life would have been if she had been born in this time. What if she, too, had been born a pureblood? Would she hold the same bigoted views as the rest? It was a troubling thought, but she decided firmly that she wouldn’t. </p><p>But Riddle… he was different than she’d expected.</p><p>She had not expected the easy flow of conversation between them, nor did she anticipate a natural curiosity to spark within her.</p><p>Hermione Granger was surrounded by Death Eaters. She had been presented with the perfect opportunity to destroy Voldemort’s plans before they even took root, yet she was <em>curious</em>, as she had been with the fountain pen. She wanted to know what kind of magic Tom Riddle was capable of. She wanted to know <em>why </em>he felt that blood and violence and bigotry were the only way. What kind of person would he have been if he had not grown up the way he had?</p><p>She knew why she was feeling this way, why she was asking these questions. Killing him when he was a wraith-like, red-eyed demon from her worst nightmares… well, that was easy. It was easy to want to destroy him when he was actively hunting down and murdering the people she loved. But this version of him? A charming and handsome, and very <em>human</em>, young man with intriguing banter and a face that grew bitter when he spoke about his father… Hermione knew it would be difficult to justify killing him. She would have to dig deeper, to find a way to force his true self to the surface. He was, after all, still a murderer, even now. She knew he was a monster. But the evil within was well hidden beneath broad shoulders, a sharp jawline, and <em>distracting </em>lips.</p><p>Though human and quite handsome, he most certainly was still a monster, and she hated him. She would force herself to remember his evils until the very moment she took his life.</p><p>Hermione turned sharply at the sound of approaching footsteps. She whirled around to find Tom Riddle striding from the staircase and through the balcony doorway. He stopped short when he saw her standing there.</p><p>“Miss Dumbledore...” came his disarming voice, giving Hermione a start. There was something in his hand, but she couldn’t quite make out what it was.</p><p><em>Speak</em> <em>of the Devil</em>... and the Devil shall appear.</p><p>“Forgive me," he muttered. "Didn’t mean to startle you. Thought I’d come out and think for a few… I didn’t realize I would have company.” </p><p>She cast a glance at him as he came to stand beside her. “I suppose we had the same idea, but I don’t mind going back to the ballroom if you need a moment alone with your thoughts.”</p><p>He waved away her politeness as if it were an annoying gnat. “No. Stay,” he demanded shortly.  He gave no explanation, no gracious entreaty, no gallant plea. Only a command, as if that was all that was required. She realized he was quite comfortable at giving commands and expected them to be obeyed.</p><p>As annoyed as she was at him barking orders, she found the ball quite stuffy and was much more comfortable in the peacefulness of the gardens. “Good, thank <em> Merlin</em>.”</p><p>His lips turned up in an amused smirk. “I take it you’re not enjoying yourself?”</p><p>“It’s perfectly pleasant. I’m just not fond of parties in general.”</p><p>“I find that surprising, what with all the ministry galas and press events you’ve attended just this month alone. You’ve become somewhat of a socialite, it seems.”</p><p>She laughed. His eyes cut over to her when she did. “How odd that you should form that opinion of me. I was just informing Abraxas that I am, in fact, <em> not </em>a socialite. Not in the <em> slightest </em>.”</p><p>Tom found her laughter arresting, despite himself.</p><p>“Perhaps, you’re just sensational. Society can’t help but want to see more of you.”</p><p>“Please don’t flatter me, Mr. Riddle. It doesn’t come across genuine, and I’m getting enough of it from Abraxas.”</p><p>His lips twitched. “You can’t take a compliment, can you?”</p><p>She looked at him in amazement. “Can <em> you</em>?”</p><p>“Oh, absolutely. Lay one on me.” He smiled, and it made her grumpy at how perfect his teeth were.</p><p>She cocked her jaw to one side. “Your teeth are obnoxiously perfect and it’s quite irritating.”</p><p>His lips pulled to the side wryly and his hand rose to brush his fingers through his hair. “Wow. Very backhanded, but I suppose I’ll take it.”</p><p>“It’s the best I’ve got.”</p><p>He tilted his head back and laughed. “How unfortunate for me.” He turned his head toward her with a smirk. “Not all of us can be so sensational, <em> Hermione</em>. Have pity on us average blokes.”</p><p>She rubbed her lips together, holding back a smile. Was she bantering with Lord Voldemort? What was <em>wrong </em>with her?</p><p>Tom took a muggle cigarette out of a case (the mysterious object he had been carrying) and put it between his lips. He waved his hand in a quick gesture that lit the cigarette wandlessly, breathing in sharply as the cherry blazed red. The action was unexpectedly attractive and Hermione looked away quickly. </p><p>“Those are very bad for you,” she muttered.</p><p>“Are they? Figures. They’re <em>muggle</em>, after all.”</p><p>“For someone who professes such <em> disdain </em> for muggles, it seems some of your hobbies are decidedly <em> muggle</em>.”</p><p>His head snapped up at that. “How would you know that, considering we've only just met?”</p><p>Hermione tilted her head fractionally. “Well, you <em>are</em> smoking muggle cigarettes. And you read <em>muggle </em>literature. I saw your books in the library at Malfoy Manor.”</p><p>His eyes narrowed. “How do you know they were my books?”</p><p>“I saw them and thought it was strange. <em> Muggle </em>books in a <em> pureblood </em>family library? Mr. Malfoy told me they belonged to a friend of his, named Tom. I just put it together earlier when we were introduced, that you must have been the Tom he was referring to.”</p><p>His jaw tensed, and his hand snapped up to bring the cigarette back to his mouth. “You’re very observant.”</p><p>She was silent as she gazed out at the moonlit rose garden. </p><p>“You’re right,” he said on an exhale, smoke pouring from his mouth and nostrils. “I don’t particularly hate or love muggles. I’ve not had the best experience with them, granted, but I have no hatred for their culture. Although, I do think they’re dangerous.”</p><p>“Why is that?” she snapped, feeling somewhat heated by his blasé dismissal of billions of people.</p><p>He looked at her pointedly. “They’re like any race or grouping of people, Hermione. They fear what they do not understand. It’s been that way with all humans, since the dawn of time. The desire for likeness and similarity. Humans, we naturally gravitate to those who are like us; we segregate ourselves. Diversity is unnatural, it goes against our base human nature. It causes a fear of the unknown. Which, on a grand scale, eventually leads to war. Wizards are no different. The only societies that can and will survive, are those that are bold enough to resort to the sword. To <em> violence </em> .” He looked at her and his lips curved into a side-smile. “To <em> dark </em> magic.”</p><p>She gazed back at him coldly, his words washing over her like ice water. She said nothing because she knew there was <em>some </em>grain of truth in what he was saying. But that didn’t make it morally acceptable. "Have you heard of a man by the name of Bertrand Russell?"</p><p>He blinked. "I have. A muggle. Some of his mathematical principles have been used in the study of Arithmancy."</p><p>She nodded, pleased that he knew this fact. "He said that fear is the main source of <em>superstition</em> and that it is one of the main sources of <em>cruelty..</em>. He said that to <em>conquer</em> fear is the beginning of wisdom."</p><p>Riddle contemplated her words as he took another drag from his cigarette. At length, he spoke. "Fear is a great motivator, Miss Dumbledore. Not very many people are able to conquer it, therefore it presents a perfect opportunity for anyone who can <em>channel</em> it. I would argue that wisdom is not just the ability to conquer fear, but to <em>use</em> it to one's advantage."</p><p>She scoffed. "That's not wisdom. That's simply self-preservation."<br/><br/>He chuckled and she hated that it seemed patronizing. "They <em>are</em> the same thing, Hermione."</p><p>She refrained from showing her disgust, but secretly she despised his words, while simultaneously storing them away for future examination.  </p><p>"Conquering fear of <em>people</em> is one thing,” she murmured. “But to conquer the fear of <em>death</em> is another."</p><p>He smirked, tilting his head to gaze at her with intensity. "One wouldn't need to conquer the <em>fear</em> of death if they've conquered death <em>itself</em>."</p><p>Their eyes met and something dark and wicked sparked between them. A forbidden fruit. It dangled dangerously between them, and they gazed at one another as if gauging which of them would take it first. Hermione's heart began to beat erratically.</p><p>"Impossible," she murmured dismissively. "No one can conquer death. Ask the Peverells."</p><p>"Can't ask them," he said darkly. "They're dead."</p><p>"Exactly," she whispered.</p><p>He stared at her for a moment, his dark eyes roaming the planes of her face, then he flicked his cigarette onto the stone and stepped on it. “So who is this dark wizard you’ve murdered in cold blood? You’ve piqued my curiosity.”</p><p>Her lips parted in an enigmatic smile. “That is <em> my </em> little secret.”</p><p>His eyes narrowed. “I have a feeling you’re full of those.”</p><p>She shot him a bored look. “Does that intrigue you, Mr. Riddle?”</p><p>“Secrets intrigue me only because I relish uncovering them.”</p><p>“You tried legilimency on me earlier,” she smiled sweetly as she called him out. “Uncover anything interesting?”</p><p>He smirked. “You are a relatively skilled occlumens, which is impressive. I confess, though, that I wasn’t really trying.”</p><p>She decided to be cheeky. “How gallant of you. You’re brave, attempting to penetrate a young woman’s mind. What if I was imagining you naked?</p><p>His answering grin was sinister. “You assume I haven’t also imagined <em>you </em>naked… <em> Hermione </em>.”</p><p>Her cheeks flushed red. She simply could <em>not </em>catch this man off guard. Nothing phased him.</p><p>His eyes tracked the blush creeping down her chest. “I find myself forgetting, throughout the night, how young you are. You comport yourself as someone much older. I find it… <em> curious </em>.”</p><p>She narrowed her eyes and cocked her head to the side. “Perhaps <em>murder </em>ages the soul. Wouldn’t you agree?”</p><p>His eyes caught hers and she definitely caught a movement in them, a bolt of crimson. “I wouldn’t know, personally.”</p><p>She blinked away, batting her lashes dismissively. What a liar, he was. “I thought maybe you did. You <em> also </em> seem much older.”</p><p>“How old do you think I am, Hermione?”</p><p>Tom noted that she flinched when he said her name.</p><p>“Oh, I don’t know. Perhaps 28… or closer to 30.” She didn’t think he actually looked that old. In fact, he was the very definition of <em>devastating</em>. Perfection embodied. But she figured she’d bring him down a notch.</p><p>He nodded in a resigned way. “Hardship ages a person.” His voice was bitter, and his chiseled cheekbones were sharp and tense.</p><p>“Have you experienced hardship, then?”</p><p>“I was born into it, I’m afraid.”</p><p>Hermione felt something like compassion stirring in her chest. She hadn’t ever let herself dwell too long on the circumstances of Tom Riddle’s life. It had been easy not to, truthfully, when he was a raving-mad evil murderer with a bald head and snake-like eyes.</p><p>But the man standing here before her was simply that… a man. He was still a murderer, and possessed a torn-apart soul… But for the first time, since she’d been here, she thought of what it must have been like to grow up alone and unloved in a cold muggle orphanage.</p><p>She squashed the traitorous train of thought. “So… what do you do, Tom?”</p><p>He turned to look at her, surprised by the softness in her voice. She was gazing back at him with searching eyes, her lips soft and slightly parted. Tom thought that perhaps she was quite beautiful, after all.</p><p>“I work at a shop, in Knockturn Alley.”</p><p>She was quiet as she observed him. “I can only imagine that’s by choice. With such powerful friends and all <em> outstandings </em> on your NEWTs, such an occupation seems quite lackluster for someone of your… <em> genius </em>.”</p><p>He smirked. “Perhaps I should become a journalist and write about the injustices waged against house elves.”</p><p>She glared at him. “Are you mocking me? I find the complete disregard of this society for the rights of magical creatures to be quite astounding.”</p><p>He smiled, sliding his hands into the pockets of his robes. “So I’ve read. Believe it or not, I do have an interest in magical creatures.”</p><p>“That surprises me.”</p><p>“Why? You seem to have made quite a few assumptions about me for someone who doesn’t know me <em> at all </em>.”</p><p>She swallowed and looked away, casually resting her hands on the balustrade. “I would think you’d be above it, that’s all.”</p><p>He cocked his head, a serpentine movement. “On the contrary. I’m quite partial to magical creatures. I’m in possession of one, myself.”</p><p>Her eyebrows lifted. “Oh? What creature might that be?”</p><p>His lips twitched. “A sort of serpent, I suppose.”</p><p><em> A fucking murderous basilisk. Of course. </em>“How utterly predictable. You are a Slytherin, after all.”</p><p>He smirked. “I think I’m entitled to be predictable, seeing as I <em> am </em> the <em> heir </em> of Salazar himself.”</p><p>She rolled her eyes and leaned over the balustrade, resting her elbows on its stone ledge. “Is that supposed to impress me?”</p><p>He took a deep breath and turned, his back leaning against the balcony’s edge as he looked down at her. “Of course not. I’m thoroughly convinced that only a bleeding heart ready to cast himself in a lake of fiendfyre for the rights of both muggles and magical creatures could impress you.”</p><p>She smiled against her will. “At least you know what my standards are.”</p><p>He pressed his tongue against his cheek. “I’ll make a note of that.”</p><p>She allowed herself to glance over at him where he stood. When had he gotten so close? She recognized the same scent that had intoxicated her earlier in the night, rich and strangely familiar. “So where do you keep this serpent-creature?”</p><p>He thought for a moment, then his lips turned up slightly. “In the bathroom.”</p><p>“What an odd place for a pet.”</p><p>“I suppose it is.”</p><p>“I should very much like to see it.”</p><p>He smirked. “I think you’d be nearly <em> petrified </em> with fear if you happened upon it.”</p><p><em> Oh</em>, he thought he was <em>quite </em>clever. She gave him an innocent smile. “I’ve happened upon a basilisk before, so I doubt that your simple garden snake would frighten me in the slightest. Not to mention that I’ve also ridden a dragon.”</p><p>His eyes narrowed as he ran his tongue over his incisors. “What kind of dragon was it?”</p><p>“A Ukrainian Ironbelly.”</p><p>He observed her face carefully, amusement in his expression. “You’ve told so many outlandish tales tonight that I find myself not believing a word you say.”</p><p>Her eyes sparkled. “They are <em> not </em> tales, I assure you, sir.”</p><p>He fought back a smile. “In that case, should you ever happen upon another basilisk, I’d be more than happy to lend you a cock.”</p><p>Her eyes widened. Despite the fact that she knew that the crow of a rooster was fatal to a basilisk, she sensed a double meaning. When her eyes met his, he grinned widely, confirming her suspicions. Her heart fluttered uneasily, so she took a sip of champagne and then cleared her throat. “How generous of you.”</p><p>“I’m nothing, if not generous with my cock, <em> Hermione </em>.”</p><p>She choked on the champagne. Clearing her throat, she turned, scanning the ballroom for Abraxas. How <em>horrific</em>, that she should be looking for a <em> Malfoy </em>to come to her rescue. Ron and Harry would rightly keel over.</p><p>Tom grinned, his tongue sliding over his top teeth as if he knew she was looking for an escape. Unfortunately, Abraxas was nowhere to be found. </p><p>He leaned closer but she refused to meet his stare. He was so close, she could feel the warmth of his body heat at her shoulder. He smelled like a heady mixture of tobacco, oud wood, bergamot, parchment, and whiskey. He chuckled at her apparent nervousness. “Abraxas can’t save you, little witch.”</p><p>She started violently, her eyes darting to meet his. His face was mere centimeters from hers. His gaze lowered, searching her face until they paused on her lips. He was close, <em> far </em>too close. She felt his breath falling softly against her lips. It smelled of smoke and spearmint. </p><p>His hand rose, tilting her face upward to meet his with a knuckle under her chin. His expression shifted into something unreadable. It was uncertainty, fascination, and anger all at once. His jaw tensed, and then he swallowed, his Adam’s apple bobbing sensuously in his throat. Her eyes followed the movement, then slowly, fearfully, rose to meet his. They were almost black, an infinite void, and framed by dark lashes. She lost track of the time she spent gazing into them, trying to decipher his intent. His lips parted, and she realized with definite apprehension that he was deciding whether or not he would kiss her.</p><p>Hermione decided she should definitely stop him, if he did.</p><p>But his scent surrounded her, blurring her thoughts one to another. She felt her pulse beating against her throat, jumping underneath the skin. She swallowed thickly, and his eyes tracked the movement.</p><p>

</p><p> </p><p><br/>“Tom?” </p><p>A woman’s voice broke between them like a blast of icy wind</p><p>Tom blinked and for a moment he didn’t move. Then he dropped his finger from her chin and slowly turned his head to the side to locate source of the intrusion.</p><p>Walburga stood just outside the balcony door, her dark form framed by the bright light of the ballroom. Her eyes were wild, looking back and forth between Hermione and Tom.</p><p>“Yes, Miss Black. What is it?” His tone was flat and clipped. Cold.</p><p>“Abraxas sent me to find you. He said the ones you selected are all gathered in the drawing room waiting for you.”</p><p>Understanding registered in his expression, as if he’d only just remembered his intent for the evening.</p><p>“Thank you.” He shot her an icy glare that was meant to be a dismissal, but the dark-haired witch refused to leave.</p><p>His eyes found Hermione’s and she noticed they were cold and distant once more. They lingered on her for a moment before he gave a stiff bow and then straightened.</p><p>“I must go, Miss Dumbledore. Excuse me.”</p><p>Hermione nodded as he left, momentarily unable to find her voice. Her cheeks were hot with embarrassment.</p><p>Walburga stood staring at her with thinly veiled disgust. Her friend, Druella Rosier, also stood just beyond her in the ballroom, observing the scene with a watchful eye. </p><p>Hermione strode forward, intending to leave the venomous witch to her thoughts when Walburga’s arm shot out and gripped Hermione’s wrist. </p><p>Hermione glanced down in shock, noting the woman’s long nails and fingers wrapped around her skin. She met the woman’s glare and lifted her chin challengingly. “I’ll give you about three seconds to let me go before I curse you.”</p><p>Walburga smirked, but there was fear in her eyes. She clearly wasn’t sure what Dumbledore’s daughter was capable of. </p><p><em> Good, that fear is healthy, </em>Hermione thought. </p><p>The woman dropped her hand, releasing Hermione’s wrist. “Don’t delude yourself into thinking that you matter to him.”</p><p>Hermione laughed. This woman <em>actually </em>thought that she wanted <em> Tom </em> fucking <em> Riddle</em>. “I don’t know what you mean.”</p><p>Walburga smiled coldly. “I think you do.”</p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes and then fixed the witch with a pitying smile. “I think you are projecting, Miss Black.”</p><p>The woman scoffed. “Be that as it may. You’re Dumbedore’s daughter. I’ll be the one to tell you because no one else will. Everything Tom does is politically motivated. We’re all just <em> pawns </em> in his <em> grand </em> plan.”</p><p>Hermione gave her a thin smile. If she only knew the plans <em> Hermione </em>had for <em> Tom</em>. “Duly noted. Your concern is touching.”</p><p>At that, she left the woman standing in the moonlight and the crisp night air.</p>

</p><p>Hermione was walking so quickly down the hallways of Malfoy Manor that she was almost running. She was out of breath, her heart pounding as she sought out a private place where she could be alone. She didn’t want to return to the ball as she was quite out of sorts. Hermione vaguely remembered the layout of the Manor from her private tour with Abraxas, so she sought out the one place she thought would be unoccupied so she could gather her thoughts. She knew the library was across the hall from the drawing-room, which is where she had inferred that the death eaters were likely having a <em> private murderous </em>Death Eater meeting. She hoped they weren’t in the hallway when she arrived.</p><p>She made her way through dark corridors that were lit only by small sconces as the music from the ballroom echoed through the manor. She cast a silencing spell on her feet so she wouldn’t alert anyone to her presence. At length, she turned down the long hallway where the library doors came into view, and she was grateful that the corridor was empty. She heard voices coming from beyond the drawing room doors, but she slipped inside the library instead, closing the door quietly behind her. She leaned back against the wall and released her breath in halting degrees.</p><p>She had almost <em>kissed </em> Voldemort.</p><p>She thought she might be sick. For several minutes she simply breathed and tried to process what had happened on the balcony. </p><p>She was also shaken by her encounter with Walburga Black, but Hermione secretly thanked the woman for reminding her of who Tom Riddle really was, as it was apparent she had lost sight of it momentarily. Walburga was right. She <em>was </em> Hermione <em> Dumbledore</em>, and Tom Riddle was a master manipulator. She imagined him laughing to himself as he left, mocking her for being such a gullible witch. </p><p>Hermione <em>did </em>feel as if she had captured his attention in some way. But at the end of the day, she was here to undermine him, destroy his horcruxes, and then kill him. Those were her <em>only </em>goals. She saw Ron’s face in her mind. Would he be disgusted at how she had smiled and flirted with handsome Tom Riddle?</p><p>
<em> You have to get to the horcruxes, Hermione. It’s just a game.  </em>
</p><p>Hermione had always been rather self-deprecating at times. It was hard not to feel ashamed when she found herself flirting with the enemy and <em>enjoying it</em>. That was the part she couldn’t wrap her brain around. </p><p>Tom Riddle was just <em>too </em>charming. Harry had said he was charming, but she had imagined someone who was falsely polite and overly flattering, who gave fake smiles and artfully crafted compliments. But the real Tom Riddle was clever and bold, with just enough humility and a dark sort of rawness so that it all came across as genuine and authentic.</p><p>Tom Riddle was dangerous. She was more frightened of him now than ever before.</p><p>Hermione bent down and covered her face with her hands. She hadn’t realized she was shaking and was feeling quite faint. She had left her beaded bag at home for fear of losing it, so she couldn’t take another Calming Draught. Should she go home? Perhaps it was rude to leave without saying goodbye to Abraxas.</p><p>Then there was him. Malfoy was also quite charming in an entirely different way than Tom. He treated Hermione as if the sun rose and set for her, but she knew it was all an act. She would never trust a <em> Malfoy </em>. Birds of a feather flocked together, and he and Tom Riddle were as thick as thieves.</p><p>She had felt some sparks between them, but Hermione attributed it to the heat of the moment, the romance of the ball and the gowns and the champagne. She was not worried about Abraxas.</p><p>She was definitely worried about Tom Riddle.</p><p>Perhaps she could use Abraxas as a part of her plan. She could get close to him, and in turn, get close to Riddle. She needed someone who had influence and wealth and would back up her efforts in the public eye, and even if Malfoy didn’t see eye-to-eye with her on many issues, perhaps he would help her if they had a romantic connection? It was worth exploring. The old Hermione would have recoiled from the notion of that kind of manipulation, but this version of herself was ruthless, cunning, unyielding… Perhaps, Hermione Dumbledore was a Slytherin after all? </p><p>In order to disturb Voldemort's plans, she would have to beat him at his own game, which meant she would have to think like he did.</p><p>Tom might be a viper, but Hermione was a <em> phoenix </em>and she was ready to go up in flames and take him with her.</p><p>Only <em>she </em>would rise from the ashes, <em> reborn</em>, but his mangled soul would be lost forever.</p><p>Hermione toyed with her phoenix charm and began to feel somewhat better as her composure returned, so she crept about the library. She would definitely come here next week to have a look around. There were bound to be books here that she hadn’t been able to get her hands on. </p><p>Suddenly, she heard a door open across the hall. The sound echoed and penetrated even the heavy wooden doors of the library, and Hermione heard voices. </p><p>She turned and made her way back to the library entrance, pressing her ear to the crack between the doors.</p><p>“You make some compelling arguments, Riddle. I do agree with you regarding the Statute, as well as the list of banned curses. The Ministry is weak right now. We need strong leadership.”</p><p>“I’m glad you’re open-minded about it, Yaxley. I’d like the opportunity to discuss it further.”</p><p>“But what about the <em>muggles </em>and the <em>muggle-borns </em>? What is your stance on that, Riddle?”</p><p>“It depends on how the muggles choose to react to our world once it's all out in the open. They will be dealt with accordingly, but make no mistake about it, the Statute of Secrecy <em>will </em>fall, whether it be by our hand, or by its crumbling legislative infrastructure. It <em>cannot </em>hold. It’s best to get ahead of it. Muggleborns… <em> that </em>is a tender subject. I’m more than willing to hear your outlook on the matter.”</p><p>The man grunted. “I have quite a bit to say about it, in fact, but what will you do with all these followers of yours? You can’t possibly make them <em>all </em>happy? You’re a skilled politician, Riddle, but even <em> you </em> will have difficulty balancing the weight of all these opinions and expectations-”</p><p>“I’ll stop you there, Yaxley. My goal isn’t to make everyone happy. I’m not here to <em>cater </em>to anyone or <em>pander </em>to privileged purebloods. I’m a wizard with vision. I have foresight. I see what the future could hold, and I see the means to make that vision possible. I know what it will take. I’m mostly committed to the shift in the balance of power and what you and everyone else in there tonight will have to decide is what side you will be on when that power shifts. I’ll never pander, but I will <em> protect </em> and <em> promote </em> those most loyal to me.”</p><p>“I have a lot to think about, it seems.”</p><p>“See that you do. We will talk next month, Yaxley.”</p><p>“Very good. <em> Magic is might </em>.”</p><p>“<em> Magic is might </em>.”</p><p>A few more voices echoed in the hallway as the occupants filtered out of the drawing room. Hermione saw the soft light from the open door through the crack in the hallway and her heart pounded as she waited for them all to take their leave. After the muffled sounds of mumbling and shuffling feet disappeared, she heard Riddle’s voice again.</p><p>“Alright, Abraxas, I’m leaving. Get yourself down there to the ball and see to Miss Dumbledore.”</p><p>“Certainly, my Lor-”</p><p>Malfoy’s reply was cut short as Hermione heard the swift approach of heeled shoes that indicated a woman’s footsteps.</p><p>“Miss Black, This meeting does not require your presence. You should not be here,” Abraxas said politely as if she were a child.</p><p>“Sod off, Brax, I’m not here to speak to you,” she sneered.</p><p>“Black, you’re trying my patience,” Tom’s voice was flat and cold. “I don’t want to curse you but I will if you continue to be a distraction.”</p><p>“A distraction from what? Your little Gryffindor pet?”</p><p>Hermione thought that Walburga sounded quite a bit like Bellatrix Lestrange at that moment.</p><p>“What are you on about, Walburga?” asked Abraxas slowly.</p><p>“Tom knows,” she said smugly. “Caught him having a lovely little moment with the Dumbledore bitch.”</p><p>Riddle’s voice was quiet, but it was vicious. “As usual, Miss Black is meddling in affairs that do not concern her in the slightest. It’s going to get this meddlesome witch in a world of trouble.”</p><p>“You know what I think, Tom? I think you’re all <em>bark</em>, and no bite,” she laughed, a high-pitched and crazed laugh that reminded Hermione of Bellatrix.</p><p>“Crucio,” Tom murmured softly. If the hallway hadn’t been so silent, Hermione might not have even heard it.</p><p>Walburga’s screams could be heard throughout the entire manor. </p><p>She heard Tom pronounce, “silencio” and suddenly the woman’s cries were stopped short, but the grotesque sounds of her writhing and twisting on the floor could still be heard. Her heels clacked against the marble as she stamped them down madly through the pain. </p><p>Hermione had suffered the torture curse at Bellatrix Lestrange’s wand, in that very drawing room, no less, and the sound of Walburga experiencing it now hit too close to home for Hermione. She began to breathe rapidly as the memory came rushing back, but she clapped her hand over her mouth and squeezed her eyes shut tight. </p><p>“I do think that’s enough, Tom,” Abraxas muttered, an uncomfortable lilt to his voice.</p><p>“<em> Do </em> you?” Hermione shivered at the coldness in Riddle’s voice. The writhing, tossing, and turning in abject misery continued, sounds of her shoes scraping against the floor, of her palms slapping against the hard marble. </p><p>Hermione opened her mouth in horror, sliding to the floor, and buried her face against her knees. All she could hear was the chanting of Bellatrix shouting “filthy mudblood!” and her endless barrage of questions. Her skin crawled with the memory of the torture curse.</p><p>Of a sudden, the hallway was quiet. The echoing sounds of the witch’s thrashing ceased. She heard Tom mutter quietly, “Obliviate.” And then all was quiet.</p><p>Only the woman’s breath could be heard, but it was thin and strained.</p><p>After a few moments, she heard Tom say, “Get her out of here, Brax.”</p><p>“What was she <em> talking </em> about, Tom?” Malfoy’s voice bore a hint of accusation.</p><p>Riddle had clearly had enough. Abraxas gave a sharp, pained sound, but he smothered it quickly. Still, the stifled pain was apparent in the shaky, tremulous breaths that he drew. Hermione wondered what Riddle had hexed him with.</p><p>“I said get her out of here, or you’re next. I have to go.”</p><p>And with that, Hermione heard Voldemort’s footsteps retreating down the hallway.</p><p>Once his footsteps were gone, she heard Abraxas release a groan, and a muttered, “Fuck.” Then he whispered something she couldn’t hear, but she assumed it was some kind of counter-curse.</p><p>She heard Malfoy’s footsteps retreating, and she presumed that he had levitated Miss Black and was bringing her somewhere to recover.</p><p>She released her breath in halting degrees, holding a hand to her chest to feel the way her heart was beating out of her chest. She stood but instantly felt dizzy, so she fell back against the door to support her weight. Once the nausea subsided, she decided she had better get back down the ballroom. </p><p>“Well, well, well,” a gravelly voice was right in Hermione’s ear, and then she felt an arm circle around her throat from behind, and suddenly a wand was pointed at her throat. </p><p>“Wh- who…” she began, but the tip of the wooden wand pushed painfully at the groove of her jawline, effectively silencing her questions.</p><p>“What are you doing in here, and not down in the ballroom?” Hermione recognized the voice, but couldn’t put it to a face or a name.</p><p>“I- I just came to the library to clear my head. I didn’t know there would be anyone up here during the ball.” She struggled against the arm locked around her shoulders.</p><p>“Looks to me like you were eavesdropping. What was that little episode you had? Looks like somebody’s terrified of the Unforgivables.” The man chuckled, a gravelly, guttural sound. </p><p>Hermione was breathless with fear but forced herself to keep a clear head. If she could just reach her wand without the man noticing… “I was just listening to see when I could leave… I didn’t want anyone to think I’d wandered up here on <em>purpose</em>.”</p><p>The man chuckled. “But that’s exactly what I think you did, Miss Dumbledore. I think maybe I’ll tell Lord Voldemort you were looking for a story for your little column. Sounds like something a little rat like yourself would be after.”</p><p>She struggled some more but to no avail. “Wh-who is Lord Voldemort?”</p><p>“Your worst nightmare,” he whispered, and his breath smelled like rotten vegetables.</p><p>“How original,” she muttered, unable to help herself. He tightened his hold on her, jamming his wand into her jawbone. She winced, drawing air in through her teeth.</p><p>“I knew something was off about you,” he whispered.</p><p>“Why- why are <em>you</em> in the library, <em>sir</em>?” Hermione was trying to distract him so she could reach her wand or even the knife she had sheathed on her thigh. Both were underneath her dress. </p><p><em> I knew I would end up needing them, </em> she thought wryly. <em> It is Malfoy Manor, after all.  </em></p><p>“I was taking a little nap on the sofa over there when I saw you come in.” </p><p>He held out his arm in front of her and ripped up his sleeve. “I wonder, should I touch it?”</p><p>Hermione tilted her head slightly, cutting her eyes downward, and to her abject <em>horror</em>, etched across his skin in faded red ink... was the Dark Mark.</p><p>He had <em>done</em> it.</p><p>Riddle had figured out the variation of the Protean charm and had already branded some of his followers. Goodness, he moved quickly. Hermione’s eyes widened, her mouth opening as if to scream, but then she stopped herself, and her mouth fell closed with a clack of her teeth. “Wh-what is that?” </p><p>His laughter was sinister. “You’ll see...” </p><p>“Master Dolohov is NOT to <em> harm </em> Miss Dumbledore!”</p><p>Suddenly the man’s arm fell away from Hermione’s throat and she coughed, whirling around to see that the man had been thrown back several feet from where Hermione stood. He lay unmoving, and Hermione looked around frantically for the source of the voice she had heard.</p><p>“Dobby was told to get Miss Dumbledore back home <em> safe </em> and <em> sound </em>!”</p><p>Her eyes finally fell on Dobby, standing on the staircase on the other side of the library. In a blink, he had apparated over to Hermione with a snap of his fingers. “Master Dolohov sought to <em>harm </em> Miss Dumbledore…” he murmured sheepishly, looking down at the stunned man. </p><p>“<em>Merlin</em>, Dobby, if you could apparate soundlessly like that, why haven’t you been <em> doing </em> it?” The elf’s normal cracking sound gave her heart palpitations every time.</p><p>Hermione rushed over to the man, Maximilian Dolohov, presumably the father of Antonin Dolohov, whom she bloody despised. <em> The apple doesn’t fall far, </em> she thought to herself. She lifted her skirt (“look away, Dobby”) and unsheathed her wand, held it to his temple, and muttered, “Obliviate.”</p><p>Then she turned to Dobby with tears in her eyes. This wasn’t the first time that Dobby had saved her from a sticky situation in this manor, but thankfully this particular circumstance hadn’t claimed his life. “Thank you so much, Dobby. You really are a kind and noble elf.” She reached down and took his hand, giving it a squeeze. Dobby looked at Hermione with wide eyes, shock registering in his features. “Now, I’ve had quite enough of this manor, tonight. You’ll just have to give my apologies to Abraxas. Take me home, <em> now</em>, please!”</p><p>___________________________</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Tom Riddle sat at the bare wooden table in his flat, in a rather uncomfortable straight-backed chair. He had never been exposed to comfort growing up, had not even truly known the meaning of the word, and so comfort had never become a priority to him. </p><p>He sipped his coffee, replaying the events of the Ostara ball. He’d decided he needed to pivot, to re-evaluate his relationship with Dumbledore’s daughter. Their interactions at the Ostara ball had been quite perplexing.</p><p>Only a few mornings ago, he had been frustrated with his fascination with the witch and had only mildly desired her death. He’d been fairly certain that once he met her, he would find her boring or irritating or dreadfully Gryffindor-ish and she’d fade from his consciousness like the ghost of erections past.</p><p>Now he <em> intensely </em> desired her death, but killing her would not be an option. Not with the girl being such a public figure and being linked so closely to Albus Dumbledore.</p><p>He was itching to <em> avada </em> her simply because she now occupied an alarming percentage of his thoughts throughout the day. The more he tried <em> not </em> to think of her, the more forceful the compulsion became.</p><p>She was becoming much <em> more </em> than a fixation.</p><p>For someone so young, Tom found her to be incredibly self-possessed and remarkably opinionated. Well-read. Intellectual. Bold. Even beautiful, in a sort of delicate, unassuming way. Her physical appearance was growing on him by leaps and bounds. When he’d first encountered her, he hadn’t counted her overly pretty. Perhaps he wasn’t used to her particular brand of attractiveness. Slytherin girls had a certain pureblooded allure, with their cold expressions, pale skin, shiny hair, and very pronounced features. But Hermione was subtle and sunkissed and frizzy-haired, full of warmth. Now, he found himself comparing every witch he encountered with Hermione, finding them all lacking next to her. He had rarely even noticed the physical appearance of witches before. This puzzled Tom. </p><p>In the quiet early hours of the morning, when he’d left Malfoy Manor and apparated back to his flat, he’d torn off all his finery and laid down to sleep, but couldn’t seem to stop his mind from re-imagining that moment on the balcony when he’d almost kissed her.</p><p>He <em> had </em> almost kissed her. He wasn’t the type of person who lied to himself; not being truthful with one’s self implied vanity and he was nothing if not self-editing. Most of his time, when it wasn't spent reading, was spent analyzing his own thoughts, actions, and decisions in order to perfect himself.</p><p>So he thought back to the moment, determined to know precisely what it was that had driven him to act so out of character. Tom was not a romantic person; in fact, he hadn’t a romantic bone in his body. But at that moment, when the moonlight had illuminated her silken skin and her eyes were glinting with starlight, that enchanted dress of hers sparkled and her skin smelled of lavender and vanilla… He’d observed the very <em>tempting </em>way that she had flushed bright red when he teased her with a suggestive innuendo… he’d been drawn to her against his better judgment. There was something about her that was so <em>damned </em>sensual, and it infuriated Tom.</p><p>He not only found that his body intensely <em>lusted </em>after her, but he felt mentally <em>stimulated </em>by the witch. He found himself wanting to know more about her, wondering what her thoughts were on various topics. What kind of magic could the girl wield? He almost wanted to have Abraxas recommend certain topics for her column just so that he could read her very prolific and well-structured essays in <em> The Daily Prophet</em>. Hermione Dumbledore impressed him as both poised and ambitious, which Tom Riddle was incredibly attracted to. </p><p>Before he’d gone to sleep that night, he’d imagined her pretty skin flushed red and embarrassed. He’d thought about lifting the skirts of her velvet dress and pinning her against the bookcases of Malfoy’s library, gripping her thighs so hard he’d leave bruises, biting her shoulder so violently that his teeth would leave marks. He felt an irrational desire to <em>brand </em>her. He imagined her begging and pleading prettily for him, moaning his name, and grinding herself against him as he pressed his knee firmly between her thighs, her cunt soaking the knee of his trousers. He imagined shoving his fingers over her tongue and down her throat until she coughed and gagged with bright tears in her eyes.</p><p>He’d rubbed one off imagining something along those lines. Only then was he able to sleep. A deep, uninterrupted sleep, free of foreboding omens and musical laughter.</p><p>Now that the moment had passed, he had to decide if this witch was dangerous to his organization or not. Was she someone he could pull into his circle? Could she be convinced of the merits of his larger vision? With her influence and position, she could either be a powerful ally or an irritating thorn in his side. </p><p>It wouldn’t be easy to sway her loyalties when her father all but suspected Tom of seditious deeds, like torture and murder, for example. He smirked. That would be an obstacle, but he’d accomplished more difficult feats before.</p><p>He wondered if the Gryffindor witch would be able to find him a relic belonging to Godric Gryffindor? He desperately wanted a horcrux represented by each House.</p><p>Ah… But there was another issue to be dealt with… and that was Abraxas <em> fucking </em> Malfoy. Though Tom wasn’t quite certain how he wanted to handle the intelligent little witch, he knew definitively that Abraxas wanted to fuck her and Tom did not, in fact, <em> want </em> Abraxas to fuck her. Tom already felt a sort of ownership or claim over her, despite himself, and if Malfoy were to so much as breathe on her, Tom might strangle him.</p><p>He knew the urge was base and rather irrational, but he’d given up fighting his irrational urges long ago.</p><p>No, the witch was off-limits. Malfoy didn’t need to know the reasons why. He simply needed to follow orders like a good little foot soldier.</p><p>He would stop by the library later in the week and give him marching orders.</p><p>Tom stood and left his flat, locked it and warded it, and apparated to Diagon Alley to begin work at Borgin and Burkes.</p><p>He passed by the offices of<em> The Daily Prophet </em>and wondered to himself if she was there, working on her latest infuriatingly well-written and yet, destructively diabolical article. He tossed a knut to the boy at the corner stand and picked up a copy, unfolding it as he walked along. He stopped and pressed his tongue into his cheek as he read the headline.</p><p>Splayed across the front cover was the headline:<em> Gold and Goblins! New Wizarding Bank to Rival Gringott’s? </em></p><p>Of course, it was written by Hermione Dumbledore.</p><p> </p><p>

Tom stood slightly dumbfounded, and then after a beat, he tilted his head back and laughed uproariously. He applauded her boldness, and felt in some distant corner of his mind that she was communicating something to him. </p><p>Or perhaps, she had simply been inspired by their conversation at the ball.<br/>
<br/>
So, she <em>had</em> broken into Gringott’s. It was all but spelled out in the article. Was she trying to impress him?</p><p><em> Either way, </em> he thought. <em> Glad to be of service, my cheeky little witch. </em></p><p>Hermione Dumbledore had no earthly idea as yet that she’d captured the attention of, potentially, the world’s most destructive dark wizard. Tom Riddle couldn’t decide whether he was simply impressed with her and wanted her as an ally, or whether he, sinisterly, wanted her as a possession, something he could hoard away and own. Either way, he was quite fixated on her; he would watch her movements, her words, her little song and dance, carefully, like a serpent hidden in the grass, and at the proper moment, he decided, he would strike.</p><p>Then, she would be <em> his </em>to control.</p>

</p><p> </p><p>Hermione’s heels clicked briskly on the cobblestone streets of Diagon Alley as she made her way to <em> The Daily Prophet </em>for work. The morning sun was just breaking over the top of Gringott’s bank, which she assumed was already astir with news of their potential rival institution. She wore a new set of robes she’d acquired from Twillfit and Tattings. She was garbed entirely in white; the skirt of her sleek sheath dress ended just above her knees and her outer robes rose in a high collar with silver and gold embellishment and fabric that fell to her ankles; their long sleeves came down to her elbows and then fell, tapering dramatically past her knees.</p><p>Hermione had taken extra care with her appearance this morning as she had a meeting in the afternoon at the Ministry of Magic with the Minister himself, as well as several other important individuals to discuss the creation of the new bank. She was quite right about her influence at <em> The Prophet </em>and her standing in Britain’s social circles being vastly more compelling than a minor ministry position, an auror badge, or a job in legislation. The buzz around <em> Hermione Dumbledore</em>, bolstered by her status symbol as a prolific writer and as an ascending socialite, her cutting-edge sense of fashion, the scandalous rumors of her birth and lineage, the reports of her academic brilliancy, magical proficiency, and infectious charisma, all served to create a larger-than-life picture of Hermione that Great Britain was entirely enamored with. She was invited to all of the parties, Ministry events, and galas. Hermione’s brilliant suggestions, which were thrown out casually at dinner parties and over tea, were immediately brought to the higher-ups and she found herself being owled daily with invitations to “discuss her strategic recommendations” further. It was everything Hermione had dreamed of; the chance to make some difference in the magical world at large.</p><p>Of course, she had made a few political enemies; particularly those who did not share her optimistic view of the world, muggles, magical creatures, and muggle-borns alike. But there would always be a few bigots in the world, Hermione surmised, and she didn’t allow it to dull her shine.</p><p>She entered the offices and made her way to the second floor where her desk sat in front of a window in the newsroom. The large room was currently a swarming beehive of writers, copy editors, and quick-quotes quills. Her desk overlooked Gringott’s, directly across the street from the entrance to Knockturn Alley.</p><p>She gazed down the dark and misty side street, a nervous feeling stirring in the pit of her stomach like sinister butterflies flapping their wings. Hermione had underestimated Tom Riddle. She knew that in the original timeline, which she wasn’t quite sure she was still in, he had worked for Borgin and Burkes for some ten years or so before murdering Hepzibah Smith in order to create horcruxes out of Slytherin’s locket and Hufflepuff’s cup. Then, he disappeared for <em>another</em> ten years, traveling the world, searching for Ravenclaw’s diadem, and submerging himself in the Dark Arts, only to emerge back in Britain. Then he was almost physically unrecognizable due to the dramatic magical transformations he had undergone. She assumed that during <em>that</em> time, which would've been around the 1960s or 1970s, he would have begun to raise support and build an army, and <em>then </em>brand his followers with the Dark Mark.</p><p>In essence, she wrongly thought that Riddle had not been up to much at all in his younger years working as a shopboy.</p><p>Clearly, she was mistaken. He was already functioning in the role of a Dark Lord, planting seeds of unrest and sedition. He had a carefully laid plan, and his little sleeper cell of Death Eaters was primed and poised for his later return to Britain, waiting to undergird his rise to power.</p><p>She would need to work extra hard to undo the seeds of dissension that Riddle was planting. Thankfully, Tom hadn’t yet created the majority of his horcruxes. She had arrived here at the very exposition of his murderous career, so she could hopefully find the journal and somehow pry that bloody ring off his finger and destroy them. Lucius Malfoy had been in possession of the journal, so perhaps Abraxas was entrusted with its care <em>first</em>. Hermione thought slyly that she might be able to convince Tom and Abraxas to <em>give </em>her the items. She could catch more flies with honey, after all.</p><p>Hermione took a seat at her desk and whipped out her quill and a hefty textbook with a plan to spend the morning researching. She was working on a thought-provoking new article regarding ghosts and past lives and had a deadline, which her meeting at the Ministry would cut into.</p><p>“Good Morning, Kogrod.” Hermione smiled and waved at one of her office mates, a brusque goblin with shiny black hair and a hooked nose. He gave her a bombastic side eye and turned his chair pointedly in the other direction.</p><p>“Oh, don’t worry about him. He’ll be fine. He’s just a little put out over the Gringott’s article,” said Eulessia Baron, a kind pureblooded witch and a Hogwarts alum. She had been in Hufflepuff during her time in Hogwarts, and she and Hermione got along quite swimmingly. “Would you like some tea?”</p><p>“Oh, yes, please. Earl grey, if you have it.” Hermione smiled and got back to work.</p><p>Several hours and cups of tea later, Hermione was deeply engrossed in her research and writing, as she was studying the double appearance of a ghost called the <em> Cornish Count</em>, who was said to have been the same soul that walked the earth twice and ended up as a ghost in both lifetimes. However, Hermione hadn’t noticed the time steadily ticking away until the charmed clock on her desk began to scream and pump out steam, much to the irritation of her co-workers.</p><p>“Holy cricket!” she yelped, jumping out of her seat. “I’ll be late for my meeting!”</p><p>Hermione fled down the stairs forthright and hurriedly made her way out the door of The Daily Prophet, intending to use the secret ministry Floo entrance in the Leaky Cauldron, which was unfortunately on the other side of Diagon Alley, but was a little too close to apparate without feeling silly.</p><p>Hermione was hustling down the cobblestone path, her heels clicking briskly, when she collided with a tall gentleman and promptly dropped her folder full of notes.</p><p>“Ho! Slow down there,” the stranger chided.</p><p>“Oh my, I’m sorry!” Hermione wailed dolefully as she bent to pick up her notes. “I’m in such a hurry, I wasn’t paying <em> any </em> attention!”</p><p>“We really must stop meeting like this, Hermione. Where are you off to in such a hurry?”</p><p>Hermione looked up to see Tom Riddle gazing down at her with an amused expression, looking as sharp and ruinous as ever. “Oh good gracious, it’s <em> you </em>.”</p><p>He gave a surprised laugh. “It’s wonderful to see you again, as well. I must say, I would’ve expected a warmer greeting given our last encounter.”</p><p>Her cheeks heated at the reminder. She set her jaw and lifted her chin. “As it happens, I’m on my way to the Ministry, and I’m <em> almost </em> late, so <em> if </em> you’ll excuse me-”</p><p>“To discuss your new bank, perhaps?” Tom ran his tongue over his top teeth, smiling.</p><p>She huffed impatiently. “It is not <em>my </em>new bank. I’m merely… organizing a sort of <em>think tank</em>. Bringing together the best minds in order to accomplish a common goal.”</p><p>“A committee, then.” He smirked.</p><p>She couldn’t help but feel that he was mocking her. “Yes,” she said icily. “Sort of like your own little band of miscreants… your little <em> committee </em> of <em> vipers </em>.”</p><p>He snickered and gave a shrug. “They're just old school friends, Hermione.”</p><p>“Of <em> course </em> they are.” She shot him a venomous smirk.</p><p>“Why the attitude, little witch?” He was fighting back a smile.</p><p>Her heart skipped a beat. “I’m sure I don’t know what you’re talking about.”</p><p>“Right. You’re all business today, in your rather garish and professional-looking robes.”</p><p>She straightened, fighting the urge to look down and examine herself.</p><p>“They don’t show enough skin for my taste,” he said wickedly.</p><p>She glanced around, perturbed, to ensure that they weren’t within earshot of anyone. “Yes, well, <em> fortunately</em>, they weren’t designed with your pleasure in mind.”</p><p>He grinned widely, his eyes flicking downward over her form. “That’s quite alright. I’ve a vivid imagination.”</p><p>Hermione scowled, but couldn’t help the lurch in her stomach at the sight of his brilliant white teeth and heated stare. “Good. Because your imagination is <em> all </em> you will <em> ever </em> have.”</p><p>He chuckled pleasantly and turned to leave. “Enjoy your meeting with the Minister, Hermione.”</p><p>“Enjoy being a shopboy!” She called to his back as he strode away.</p><p>Riddle grinned to himself as he walked.</p><p>
<em> Soon, Hermione. Soon. </em>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<em> Dear Abraxas, </em>
</p><p>
<em> Please forgive my sudden departure from the Ball the other night. I hope I didn’t offend, but the hour had grown rather late and I, unfortunately, had an article deadline approaching and could not skive off of work Monday morning. </em>
</p><p>
<em> The celebration was beautiful and charming, and I so enjoyed meeting all of your comrades from Hogwarts. Thank you for inviting me, and please inform your dear mother that I do hope to meet her in the near future. </em>
</p><p><em> I look forward to browsing that beautiful library of yours soon. </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> <em> Sincerely, </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em> H.D.</em></p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>“Welcome, welcome, Miss Dumbledore. Have a seat.” Minister Moon indicated the seat directly in front of him. He was seated at a long, obsidian black table. He had five other Ministry officials with him, whom he introduced Hermione to as his cabinet, made up of his Administrative Assistant, Senior Advisor, Head of Financial Affairs, Economic Advisor to the Minister, and Senior Undersecretary.</p><p>Deloris Wig sat beside Hermione, as well as a goblin named Torpin, and a werewolf (nobody knew he was a werewolf) named Brutus Quintus. Brutus was a brilliant wizard, an expert in the area of magical architecture, and quite knowledgeable in several other areas of study, namely alchemy, arithmancic equations, and ancient runes. Hermione had sought him out, having already known who he was from her time. He was a rather famous wizard in her time, and it was only discovered in his later years that he was a werewolf. She’d read a biography about his life in fifth year. The goblin Torpin was unerringly loyal to the ministry, as he was a close friend of Albus Dumbledore to whom he owed his life. He acted as a liaison between wizards and goblins, but of late, the goblins had been unwilling to cooperate with his oversight.</p><p>She called upon Brutus' expertise and Deloris’ in order to put together a building and planning committee for the new bank. </p><p>Hermione presented everyoone with a copy of her notes.</p><p>“Miss Dumbledore," began Minister Moon, "you are quite a bright witch, and I thank you for this well-researched material and for the brilliant suggestion. This is something that the ministry should have tackled by now, but there’s always so much red tape and paperwork, you understand… I’ve already built quite a legacy during my administration, however, this is another crystal ball that I would like to get rolling, so to speak, before my term ends. Would you like to say anything, with all of us present?”</p><p>Hermione took a deep breath. “Well… I do believe that goblins are very misunderstood, and very mistreated creatures. Wizards and goblins have always harbored grudges and mistrust for one another, and I don’t see that changing for a very long time. I do think there should be more legislation in place that protects and supports goblins and their rights, and I am willing to campaign for that at some point. However, the Gringotts monopoly is not fair, nor is it moral, nor should it even be legal. There should be measures in place that demand alternatives so that there cannot be monopolies of this kind. Are you aware of the interest rates that goblins are charging for loans?”</p><p>The members of the cabinet exchanged looks.</p><p>“We are vaguely aware of this, yes.”</p><p>“Are you also aware of the exchange rates for gold to muggle money? For foreign currencies to galleons? It’s absolutely outrageous what they are charging. I believe the goblins are taking far too many liberties in their greed. I have also discussed this with Mr. Quintus, who is an extremely skilled alchemist and has experience with testing precious metals and their magical qualities. We all know that there is a ministry-regulated formula for the gold compound that makes up our galleons. Mr. Quintus has tested the galleons and the percentage of gold in the compound has been lowered by almost 2%. Now, that isn’t much when testing one galleon, but in millions of galleons? It’s a fortune in gold! Mr. Quintus has brought parchments with his test results and his research.”</p><p>The Minister looked plumb gobsmacked. His cabinet exchanged worried glances, immediately requesting copies of the research and parchments. </p><p>Hermione went on. “He also believes that the goblins have created and placed an enchantment on the newest issuing of gold. It is a variation of the summoning charm. It has been tampered with and, in essence, it curses the gold so that it will always end up returning to a goblin’s hand.”</p><p>Now, Hermione had gone to all the trouble of having Brutus Quintus test the gold because she vaguely remembered hearing about this particular transgression of the goblins, but it wasn’t actually uncovered until the 1980s, and by then, the wizarding world had lost so much money in gold and the goblins involved had lined their pockets immeasurably. It resulted in a mass arrest and quite a few goblins ended up in Azkaban. Hermione figured she would save a few goblins from the dementors and catch them ahead of the game, saving lots of wizards' money, and in turn, give the Ministry a good reason to invest in a new wizarding bank, which was just good sense after all, because when it came down to it, the goblins simply could not be trusted.</p><p>“A new banking institution for the British wizarding community has been a long time coming, Minister. There have been too many close calls and talks of uprisings from the goblins. Really, the last goblin rebellion was less than fifty years ago! Witches and wizards should have a choice about where they keep their gold. Mrs. Wig here is skilled with wards and protective enchantments, and I believe that if we merge our magical security with muggle methods, we can offer a safe and <em> fair </em>alternative to Gringott’s.”</p><p>The Minister was eyeing Hermione as if he’d never seen her before. He didn’t speak for several minutes.</p><p>“But what will happen,” began the Senior Undersecretary, “when the goblins cause an uprising because wizards are moving their gold out of Gringott’s?”</p><p>Hermione couldn’t believe her ears. “If the goblins are planning an uprising, they will be looking for a reason to fight. This will give them that reason, and it will flush out a rebellion, <em> if </em> there is to be one. It’s better to deal with it and shut it down immediately. Don’t you agree?”</p><p>“Oh, indeed, Miss Dumbledore,” said Minister Moon. “It is a <em> brilliant </em> way to kill two birds with one stone, so to speak.”</p><p>The Minister continued to look at Hermione as Brutus began to explain his research and testing methods in depth, and Deloris shared her ideas as to the best security methods and how the new bank would differ from Gringott’s. Hermione even hinted at a possible new method of keeping track of the gold magically using ancient runes, which would make it possible to have a system similar to the muggle method of carrying bank cards.</p><p>“Brilliant. Truly brilliant,” said the Minister. “We will talk more about this matter. See that you have regular meetings to flesh out the details of this venture.”</p><p>As the meeting concluded and Hermione scooped up her remaining notes, Minister Moon approached her. </p><p>“Hermione,” he began. “I would sincerely like it if you would attend a little gathering in my home, this coming Wednesday night. There will be a few of my close friends and ministry acquaintances in attendance. I would like to speak with you more about your career. I must admit, I am shocked by your level of initiative and ingenuity. At such a young age, why, that hints at a very promising future. It is no wonder you bear the Dumbledore name.”</p><p>Hermione’s mouth fell open slightly. “I- But… what a compliment coming from you, Minister. Thank you.”</p><p>He nodded, watching her thoughtfully. “You seem to have a passion and a deep understanding of the muggle world. I think we can put that to good use.”</p><p>Her eyes widened. “I would very much like that, Minister Moon.”</p><p>He nodded. “Very good. We will talk more. Be on the lookout for my owl, I will have a personal invitation sent.”</p><p>“Thank you, sir.” </p><p>Hermione apparated back home that evening feeling very much like the world was her oyster. Something about being in this time felt right, as if she were always meant to be here. Living in her own time, she had always felt outcast, unwelcome, as if she never quite… fit. Even as a war hero, she hadn't felt particularly appreciated, or perhaps the better word was, <em>understood</em>.</p><p>For the first time since she’d traveled back to 1948, Hermione questioned if she actually <em> wanted </em> to go back home if the path presented itself.</p><p>But <em> of course </em>, she did. How ridiculous! She missed her parents, Harry, and Ron. </p><p>Still, she thought that if she could make a difference here that would change their lives for the better, then of course, she would stay here forever. Without a question.</p><p>Hermione spent the night celebrating her small victory with a hearty dinner of bangers and mash, with hot apple pie and ice cream to top it off. She sat out on her balcony that night with her bare feet kicked up, licking the last of the cinnamon apples and ice cream off her spoon. She became pensive as she looked up at the stars, but she didn’t think of Ron or Harry… or even of Dumbledore or Abraxas Malfoy... Instead, she let herself think of Tom Riddle, his perfect teeth, and what he would have said about her accomplishments that day.</p><p> </p>

</p><p> </p><p>Tom Riddle’s shoes crunched on the gravel of a rocky shore. The sky was dark, though it was only midday. He supposed the sky always looked like this here… dark and thunderous gray, backlit by an eerie, colorless glow, with no sun or stars to speak of. He wondered if it was merely an illusion of the mind or if it really existed this way all of the time. </p><p>The turbulent sea crashed about him. Tom had only visited Azkaban prison once before, and the ocean had been like this then, as well. Tempestuous and unrestrained. Restless. As if the very spirit of the water was troubled by the air here. He wondered if he were to dip his toes in, would they be encircled by thick tentacles and dragged below the dark surface, thousands of leagues beyond hope?</p><p>Hope. It was absent here. It had not survived amongst the crashing waves and the cold, unforgiving stone. Tom looked ahead at the structure that loomed before him. It rose from the landscape as if it were simply a part of the jagged rock upon which he stood. As if it were carved from the sharp knife of fear that hung in the air here like a poisonous vapor. It tried to wrap its tendrils around Tom and pierce his heart, but Tom did not shake it away. He let it greet him as an equal, loosening its grip and resting there upon him like a symbiont. </p><p>As a boy, Tom had gotten his hands on a muggle book called <em> The Count of Monte Cristo </em>. Azkaban had always reminded him of the prison in which Edmund Dantes spent fourteen years trapped, before he was dumped in the ocean in a body bag, with a millstone tied ‘round his ankles. That would’ve been a better fate than Azkaban prison.</p><p>Tom’s eyes blinked to the sky, observing the swirling vortex of hungry dementors as they encircled the prison. They were already aware of his presence, he knew. Dementors had never affected Tom as they had others. They almost seemed repulsed by him, as if his soul were a meal they would rather not stomach. Tom supposed he had very few happy memories for them to feed on, so the despair of this island never governed Tom in any kind of influential way. He supposed that was an advantage; perhaps the dementors could be a sort of alliance. A rather unintelligent, single-minded, mutinous alliance, but still an alliance all the same. One simply had to know how to motivate. All that power <em> truly </em> consisted of was the ability to motivate all different types of people.</p><p>Tom was not able to cast a corporeal Patronus. It was alright, he supposed, because he had never needed it. He had been able to cast it <em>once</em>. Right after he had murdered his father; it had been the single most satisfying moment of his life. It felt like a release of something, a rope that had been strangling him. Following that encounter, he had cast a powerful serpent patronus. He felt rather smug about it; until the elation had eventually faded, and he was left with only a bitterness that set in like an infection… like the spread of gangrene. Then, he never was able to produce the charm again. He was consoled at least by the fact that his inadequacy wasn’t a magical one, but an emotional one. That would prove to be Tom’s weakness throughout his life, unfortunately.</p><p>He wondered if Hermione felt the same bitterness toward her father. But no, that couldn’t be; Albus had seemingly not known of her existence. She had not been brutally dismissed from his life like an irritating gnat that one could bat aside.</p><p>Tom wondered if she could cast a patronus, and if so, what memory would she use, and what form hers would take?</p><p>Again, his thoughts drifted to her like they were swept up in an inescapable current, threatening to drown him. He had thought often of slitting her throat the past two weeks since Ostara, but the urge was less and less potent as the days wore on. Now, he only thought of nicking her a bit. Just enough to see the bloom of her blood seeping through the cut. </p><p>He had strange thoughts about her. He imagined every place Abraxas had touched her and felt the irrational urge to strike a match and burn his touch away from her skin. He supposed he wanted to hear her gasp and scream, but there were much better ways to elicit those kinds of sounds from her pretty lips. Of course, he would never act on these odd thoughts. He could recognize when his mind was acting up. Perhaps, it was that <em>seed</em> of darkness planted in him from the <em>dark</em> <em>arts</em>, as Hermione had written about in her column. He imagined a garden of black, poisonous roses, thorns as sharp as talons, blooming within his severed soul. He saw Hermione walking through that garden, garbed in a white cloak, attempting to heal the noxious overgrowth with her touch.</p><p><em>You can never undo it,</em> <em>little witch, </em>he thought. <em>The damage is done, I’m afraid.</em></p><p>Riddle made his way up the rocky shore, climbing the slope toward the prison. </p><p>He approached a side door where he knew there dwelled a handful of guards, wizards who were warded in and sheltered from the effect of the dementors beneath countless spells. He knocked on the little window in the iron door. After a minute or two, it creaked open.</p><p>“I need to visit a prisoner,” Tom said to the bloodshot eyes that appeared in the slot.</p><p>“Hold on a minute,” said a voice.</p><p>After what seemed like half an hour, but was more like ten minutes, the door opened and to Tom’s surprise, a woman walked through. She was a squat witch, with what might have been red hair, but the color had leached from it prematurely. Dementors will do that, Tom supposed.</p><p>“Do you have identification?”</p><p>Tom handed her the stolen wand,  which she then confiscated. “No wands allowed in the prison.”</p><p>“Fair enough.” He was fairly proficient at wandless magic, in any case.</p><p>“Follow me.” She cast a spell over him, which seemingly allowed him to penetrate the wards of the prison. She also charmed him with a spell that mimicked peculiar warmth and elation; it trickled down his neck and arms like a hot shower. He supposed it was to counteract the effect of the dementors, but Tom didn’t need the added support. They probably grew tired of reviving fainted visitors.</p><p>Their party of two grew with the addition of no less than <em> six </em> dementors. They flanked them in the air above as they walked through the front gates of the prison. He would need to communicate with them when his visit was over.</p><p>“What prisoner are you visiting?” she asked in a bored tone.</p><p>“Dominik Hausler,” he replied smoothly.</p><p>She stopped short and turned to look at him. Tom stared back at her blankly as she took in his appearance. He was polyjuiced to look like a particular wizard who worked in the Ministry of Magic, whom several of his Death Eaters had encountered issues with. The wizard, while professing the same beliefs as Tom and his followers, had adamantly rejected their offer to join the organization, citing that he would never follow after a “Half-Blood shopboy” and had proceeded to run his mouth consistently around the Ministry about Tom’s Death Eaters, forcing them to obliviate no small number of ministry workers. The last straw occurred when Mulciber reported to Tom that the man, whose name was Cyrus Pilloughby, had proceeded to pop his mouth off about a certain <em> Daily Prophet </em> columnist, calling her a “muggle-loving cunt” and “the Dumblewhore,” adding to that the indication that her mouth was “quite fuckable.”Despite the fact that Tom agreed with his assessment of her mouth, he found the man’s comments on his newest fixation to be in rather bad taste and therefore was deserving of death or a permanent stint in Azkaban.</p><p>“<em> That </em> prisoner,” she began, “is limited to one visitor per month.”</p><p>Tom’s jaw tensed. “I know for a fact that prisoner hasn’t seen another soul in <em> ten </em> months, so if you please, take me to him.”</p><p>She gazed back at him curiously, as if by looking at him, she could penetrate his mind. He recognized her as a legilimens, and a damn good one, but he was an even <em> better </em> occlumens. He snapped his obsidian mental walls into place, his face a smooth blank mask.</p><p>Tom was an impenetrable fortress to rival Azkaban.</p><p>“Come along,” she sighed.</p><p>He followed her as she led him into the heart of the prison. They wound through a maze of corridors, the outer bands of which contained cells with little windows. Those hallways were filled with the grotesque sounds of moaning and sobbing, all clearly at war with one another for <em> which </em> could be the <em> loudest </em>. The sorrowful music would have struck the heart of the average wizard, but Tom had grown used to the sound of weeping as a child.</p><p>Children do shed tears dreadfully, particularly when they are informed that their parents are six feet under and they’re shoved into a cold and crowded orphanage with very little to eat.</p><p>At last, they stopped before a heavy iron door. The balls of light dimly illuminated the entrance to the cell. There were no magical enchantments or wards on the door, only heavy locks and an iron bar. He imagined the prisoners were in such a weakened state physically and mentally that they wouldn’t be able to attempt an escape by magical means. Dementors had a way of crippling the magic of most wizards.</p><p>Tom was not like <em> most </em> wizards.</p><p>He had lived years with the kind of despair that dementors inflicted. That tragic hopelessness is the thing that Tom had allowed to drive and propel him. His own misery strengthened him, in a sense, because for many years, his misery was all that he possessed.</p><p>The woman ushered him forward into the dark cell. Once he had crossed the threshold, she slammed the heavy door shut behind him. He didn’t hear her footsteps retreating, so he assumed she was standing guard at the door.</p><p>The balls of light had followed him into the dank cell, and they gave him a rather imprecise look at the man who lay on a tattered cot on the floor. The man had straight, yellowed hair, somewhat gray and devoid of color, but the lighting wasn’t good. A long scar started at the height of his temple and slashed downward, over his eyelid, cheek, and mouth, dragging the lips downward somewhat, giving him half a scowl. He appeared to have just woken, but the dark bags under his eyes weren’t from lack of sleep. His clothes were in rags.</p><p>Tom stood staring at the man for some time before the man spoke in a gravelly voice.</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>“My name is Lord Voldemort.”</p><p>“What do you want?”</p><p>Right to the chase. He liked the man already.</p><p>“Forgive me, I know it is customary to bring a gift when visiting someone’s abode, but the dementors were loathe to let me in with any objects or even a <em> wand </em>. Wise of them, considering who I am, but rather inconvenient for you, all the same.”</p><p>“And who are you, then?” The man stared at him blankly, not an ounce of emotion behind his eyes. Tom noticed the man’s hands seemed to bear a permanent tremor.</p><p>Tom knelt down in front of him, lowering his voice. “I know you are one of Grindelwald’s Generals. I know you developed spells and potions for him.”</p><p>“Yeah,” he muttered darkly. “Look where it ended me up.”</p><p>“Certainly. You did choose the wrong master. But I will admit, there are aspects of Grindelwald’s cause that I admire. He made many mistakes, though.”</p><p>The man laughed, a wet, hacking sound.</p><p>Tom waved his hand, and the man’s clothes were new, his hair clean, and all dirt washed from his skin.</p><p>The man glanced down at himself, then back at Riddle. “Thanks for the makeover, <em> boy </em>.” He continued to laugh.</p><p>This time, Tom laughed.</p><p>“Do you want to be free of this place, Dominik?”</p><p>The man’s laughter curbed. He looked at Tom with thoughtful eyes. </p><p>Yes, indeed. He wanted to get out of Azkaban more than anything.</p><p>There it was. <em> Motivation </em>.</p><p>“I know you trained with Grindelwald and he taught you… very <em> specific </em> forms of magic.”</p><p>The man nodded, his eyes trained on Tom like a feral dog. “A lot of good it's done me in here.”</p><p>“You’ll teach me. I have need for the ability to create <em>inferi</em>, among other things. Much more obscure… things.”</p><p>Dominik narrowed his eyes. “Those <em> things </em> you refer to are not easily achieved by just <em> any </em> wizard… <em> Lord </em> Voldemort.” He practically spat the name.</p><p>“I can get you out of here.”</p><p>“That’s never been done. Azkaban has never been breached.”</p><p>“I suppose that will require an exceptional wizard to do such a thing, then, won’t it?”</p><p>Dominik stared at Riddle.</p><p>Tom lowered his voice, leaning closer. “You fled to Britain, which was a mistake. There are other safe places for wizards like yourself to hide. Albania, for one. Other places in the east. I know creatures that are sympathetic to our cause. I can hide you.”</p><p>The man swallowed, a glimmer of hope reflected in his corpse-like face. “You want me to teach you the results of Grindelwald’s experiments...”</p><p>“I want you to swear allegiance to me. You will make an Unbreakable Vow, and take my Dark Mark.”</p><p>The man huffed out an incredulous laugh. “And <em> why </em> would I do that?”</p><p>Tom smiled coldly. “Because if you don’t, I will walk right out of this prison and you’ll never see or hear from me again. I am assuredly the <em> only </em> wizard who can help you. You’ll take the Vow, or live out the rest of your pathetic existence in this cell.”</p><p>The man observed Riddle. His first impression of Tom had been that of an arrogant and overconfident young man. But as he stared at Riddle now, he noted the coldness in the young man’s face. The balls of light, as if bidden, floated near Tom, illuminating his dark eyes. Suddenly, as if Tom knew what Dominik was searching for, his eyes shifted to brilliant red, uninhibited by the Polyjuice potion, glowing at him in the dark. Though the older man was used to the cold, it sent a shiver down his spine. </p><p>This… <em> Voldemort </em>. He did indeed remind him of Grindelwald vaguely. But there was something different, something that Dominik couldn’t put his finger on.</p><p>Riddle held out his hand, his red eyes locked with Dominik’s.</p><p>The man cleared his throat. “Get me out of here… and I’ll take the Vow.” He reached out and grabbed Tom’s wrist with as much strength as he could muster. “<em> And </em> your mark <em> . </em> Then I’ll teach you whatever you want to know. <em> ” </em></p><p>Tom wrapped his fingers around the man’s bony wrist as well, their grips locked. Tom yanked the man toward him, til their faces were level, and his smile sent another shiver across the man’s skin. “You’ve just made a deal with the Devil, my friend.”</p><p>Dominik’s congested laugh echoed through the stone chamber. “I’m a dead man, anyway. I gave up my soul a long time ago.”</p><p>Riddle stood and made his way to the iron door, rapping on it loudly with his knuckles. “I suppose that makes two of us.”</p>

<p>“Hermione,” Dumbledore began. “Have you ever heard the saying, ‘Offense is the best Defense?’”</p><p>She smiled. “I have, sir. I believe it’s a muggle phrase.”</p><p>He looked down at her through his spectacles. “So it is. A very apt phrase. You know I’m fond of them. I’ve always prided myself in my own ability to turn a phrase.”</p><p>She smiled, thinking to herself that this younger version of Albus was not so unlike his older self. They were meeting this Sunday for tea and occlumency lessons at Hogwarts, at Dumbledore’s request. </p><p>“There is a particular strategy that I like to call counter-legilimency. When a skilled legilimens has broken past your mental defenses to enter your mind, this is when their own thoughts are most vulnerable. They are distracted by their own assault upon your mind. Rather than attempt to push them out by brute magical strength, an easier tactic is to use a counter-attack to penetrate <em>their </em>mind. This, in turn, forces them to retreat to fortify their own defenses. Very few legilimens can maintain both. It takes a great deal of mental fortitude, practice, and skill to sustain impenetrable mental defenses <em>and </em>a forward assault. This is the strategy that you will learn today, Miss Granger.”</p><p>“I’m excited to learn, Albus.”</p><p>He nodded. “I will be your teacher, however, I will not be your training partner. I do not trust myself with the memories and information that you house within your mind. It’s possible that I might happen upon memories that I do not wish to see. Therefore, I will have a very trustworthy and capable helper today. Lucky!”</p><p>Suddenly, a house-elf appeared with a crack! on Dumbledore’s desk.</p><p>“Lucky,” said Dumbledore kindly. “This is my daughter, Hermione. Hermione, Lucky is my personal house elf. Upon reading your latest column relating to house elves, Lucky and I have worked out a paid wage for her services. Lucky was also given the opportunity for freedom, but she has denied wanting to work for anyone else.”</p><p>“Lucky is happy to be working for the greatest wizard in the world, Albus Dumbledore! Lucky is <em>lucky </em>to serve such a wizard!” the house-elf beamed. Her eyes were huge and wide, a golden color, like large moons. Unlike most house elves that Hermione had met, she had a bright mop of blonde hair and an adorable button nose. Hermione loved her instantly.</p><p>“But… is she to practice legilimency on me?” Hermione had no idea how that would work.</p><p>Albus’ eyes sparkled. “The funny thing about house-elf magic, is that these beings are capable of remarkable feats of magic if only they are <em>instructed </em>to do so by the wizard that they serve. In addition, the minds of house elves are nigh impenetrable to any but their masters. Despite that fact, very few people think about or give credence to house elves. For such underappreciated creatures, they really are <em>quite </em>powerful. I have instructed Lucky to perform legilimency on your mind, and therefore, she will be capable of doing so. However, she is bound by her servanthood to me, to protect <em> any and all </em> memories that she may see.”</p><p>Hermione was dumbfounded. She greatly appreciated the way that her mentor’s mind worked, to have thought of something so simple and yet brilliant. Hermione bent down to the little elf, holding out her hand. “Hello, Lucky. I’m Hermione.”</p><p>The house elf took her hand shyly and then bowed low. </p><p>For the next hour, Lucky would press her way into Hermione’s thoughts, but it was surprisingly painless. Most of Hermione’s experience with legilimency left her with splitting headaches. After several rounds, Hermione successfully managed to counter the assault by reversing the spell on Lucky. She was pleased, when faced with the house elf’s memories, to find that Lucky was extremely content in her life of servitude to Dumbledore.</p><p>At the end of the hour, she bade goodbye to Lucky, who disappeared with another loud crack. Hermione would <em> never </em> quite get used to that.</p><p>“Next week, we will hone your ability to occlude whilst dueling. It is important to keep your mind sharp while casting spells and counter-curses. Your magical ability is weakened when you are in the midst of a duel, so your stamina must increase in order to shield and occlude at the same time.”</p><p>“I really appreciate you taking the time to train me, Albus. I would never be able to learn this on my own.”</p><p>Dumbledore nodded. “I’ve been meaning to tell you how very proud I am of your recent accomplishments. Your writings are superb. I hear of them <em> everywhere </em> I go. In addition, the whole Ministry is astir about your proposal of a new bank. The DMLE is currently investigating the goblin’s breach of contract with the Department of Magical Finance. I’m also quite impressed with your partnership with Brutus Quintus. He is a very good friend of mine.”</p><p>Hermione was blushing and stammering in the best possible way. Albus was her role model and to hear this kind of praise from him was nearly the height of achievement for Hermione. “Thank you, sir.”</p><p>“I confess myself very proud to be able to call you daughter, Hermione. Do continue to shine brightly. The world needs a star, when the sky turns black.”</p><p>“That reminds me, sir. I’ve been invited to the Minister’s home this week, to a private gathering of sorts. Minister Moon says he wants to talk more about my career.”</p><p>“Ah, yes. I, too, was invited. Yet I find myself unable to attend, unfortunately.”</p><p>“<em> Oh </em>,” Hermione said, a bit crestfallen. “Why ever not?”</p><p>Albus looked down at her through his spectacles and his brilliant blue eyes were twinkling. “Well… because I simply don’t want to go. Not in the slightest.”</p><p>Hermione stared at him in shock. Then, she burst into laughter, unable to stop herself.</p><p>Dumbledore smiled at her mirthfully. “I find that I would much rather be home by a crackling fire with a glass of peach brandy and a box of Fizzing Whizbees than blowing smoke up the new Minister’s dress robes. When you earn the title of the world’s most powerful wizard and duelist, you realize that the wisest thing one could do is prioritize one’s own time and happiness… Because <em> time </em> is the only thing we cannot redeem. I hope you will also learn in the coming years, Hermione, that the most profound and underrated word you could ever learn to say... is <em> no </em> .”</p><hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Riddle awoke in the darkness of his flat to a violent peal of thunder. Lightning lit the sky outside his window, silhouetting an old lamppost against the pouring rain. He had been dreaming of the night he made the <em>tempaestus</em>; the ground had been shaken and a loud crack rent the sky as he had ripped open the fabric of time. The storm raging outside must have bled into his dream. Tom’s heart raced. He had seen her. <em> Hermione </em>. </p><p>She was so… different. She had been in his flat, cooking for him. She wore strange clothes. What looked like men’s denim trousers and odd white loafers. A kind of jumper and cloak blended together. Muggle clothes. <em> Strange </em> ones. Her hair was loose and free, with wild curls, no longer tame and smooth, and she wore no makeup.</p><p>He had watched her flitting about the kitchen in the dream as he sat at his rickety table. She stirred some kind of batter. </p><p>He struggled to remember the dream.</p><p>Scones. She had been baking scones.</p><p>She complained that he was too thin, and asked him what he had been eating. He hadn’t been able to tell her. He rarely thought about food or even remembered what he had eaten from one meal to the next. He hardly had time to. Some days he went all day without eating, only having coffee or tea.</p><p>He realized that he could be perceived as <em> too thin </em>. He would have to remind himself to eat.</p><p>Tom rubbed at his eyes. He wasn’t sleeping enough. Between working all day, researching and learning new forms of magic, practicing his skills in dueling, and balancing his social and political obligations, he was spread very thin.</p><p>Tom stared up at his ceiling, vibrating with the after-effects of the dream. His ceiling leaked in the corner, dripping water into the wood floor. It reminded him of the orphanage. He grabbed his wand and fixed it with a mending charm. It would just begin to leak in another spot the next time it rained.</p><p>Oftentimes, he still felt like that fucking orphan boy whom every other child disliked, because he was <em> different </em>.</p><p>Soon, <em> different </em> had turned into <em> devious </em>.</p><p>Then, <em> devious </em> developed into <em> depraved </em>.</p><p>He reached for the dream with his magic, willing it to return to his mind.</p><p>She had opened a drawer in his kitchen and pulled out a box.</p><p><em> His </em> black leather box. The box containing the <em> tempaestus </em>. Its runes glowed as she opened it. </p><p>Before he’d known what happened, she had touched the pen and she was gone. Then he was back on the hill in front of Riddle House. He had ripped open the fabric of time with a dark, ancient incantation. An egyptian one. It had taken him two years just to decipher its hieroglyphics and phonetics. Riddle hadn’t even been sure that his research had been done correctly. With most magic he was very precise. But this spell had been a shot in the dark. </p><p>He knew he had gotten it at least partially correct when the earth shook and shifted. Almost three years of preparation yielded a spell that had been activated in the span of what seemed like mere seconds. Time moved very fast and slow all at once, but in his dream, he heard Hermione scream from the other side of the tear, so far away from him.</p><p>Then, a crack of thunder split the sky and the rip sealed itself, pulling her away from him. She was gone. Her screams had been cut off. It had felt as if one of his horcruxes were destroyed. A sucking of his soul from his body.</p><p>Tom had awoken in a cold sweat, hands shaking.</p><p>Very few things shook Tom Riddle. Divination was one of them.</p><p>Dreams were another.</p><p>They struck him as evidence of something <em> other </em> . Something… <em> beyond </em>.</p><p>That both excited him and terrified him.</p><p>Seeing prophecies come to pass… they led him to believe in the existence of fate. </p><p>Tom Riddle wasn’t sure if he wanted to believe in fate.</p><p>He didn’t <em> need </em> to believe in fate.</p><p>He believed in <em> himself </em>.</p><p>He was the master of his own fate.<br/>
<br/>
So it begs the question…</p><p>Why did this witch haunt his dreams?</p><p><em> Why </em> must she consume his <em> thoughts </em>?</p><p>Tom looked at his pocket watch suddenly. <em> Fuck </em>.</p><p>He was supposed to be at the Minister’s house in ten minutes.</p><p>He had fallen asleep by accident… <em> collapsed </em>out of pure exhaustion.</p><p>His newest acquaintance, Wilhelmina Tuft, who happened to be a candidate for the position of Minister for Magic, had invited him to Minister Moon’s house that evening. She’d kept regular owl correspondence with him since Ostara.</p><p>“A meeting of tomorrow’s ascendant stars,” she had written. She found Tom to be quite charming and seemed pleased with his political allegiances. </p><p>Tom found her vapid, but that wouldn’t stop him from flashing her a smile.</p><p>Charm. Manipulate. Motivate.</p><p>Those who couldn’t be charmed could be <em>manipulated</em>.</p><p>Those who couldn’t be manipulated could be <em>motivated</em>.</p><p>Those who couldn’t be motivated… could be <em>murdered</em>.</p><p>It was all the same to Tom. As long as the result was the same at the end of the day.</p><p>Life was his chessboard.</p><p>But what was his <em>little</em> <em>witch</em> doing now? </p><p>He felt as though they were on opposite sides of a chess board... he the black pieces, and she the white, playing two different games, yet contained to the same board, weaving in and out of one another, waiting for a moment of confrontation.</p><p>Hermione was bright, and she was powerful… but was she <em>deadly</em>?</p><p>Did she possess that quality somewhere within her? Or was she as soft and warm on the inside as she appeared on the outside?</p><p>Tom wanted to know. He wanted to dig around deep inside of her and pull out her basest instincts and inclinations.</p><p>He wanted to uncover her fears and motivations like a skilled archaeologist and <em>use </em>them. </p><p>Tom’s questions were driving him mad. They <em> plagued </em> him.</p><p>The witch seemed to possess a drive to accomplish. What drove her?</p><p>Was it the same drive that Tom <em> himself </em> possessed?</p><p>Who was Hermione <em> really </em>? Was she truly the offspring of the famous Dumbledore?</p><p>Riddle knew she was lying about <em> something </em>. His instincts told him that much.</p><p>M<em>ore importantly… </em>what did the dream mean? </p><p>He had no time to think about it now.</p><p>He truly had no time for Hermione at all. Tom barely had time for himself.</p><p>He took a speedy shower, threw on his robes, and grabbed his wand. He was always sure to put on cologne anytime he left his flat, his little ritual. It was as spiritual to him as the Eucharist. He wore an expensive and complex cologne, imported from Spain with notes of cedarwood, amber, and oud wood. It was the only splurge he really allowed himself because, with his compulsive personality, smells happened to affect him rather dramatically. </p><p>It was another of his little <em> fixations </em>.</p><p>It had been <em> one </em> of the reasons why he’d been so drawn to Hermione at the Ostara Ball. She smelled irreverently sinful, like lavender, sandalwood, salt, and vanilla, but it put him slightly off at how similar her scent was to Amortentia.</p><p>He bloody <em> hated </em> Amortentia.</p><p>Every time he smelled that blasted potion, he thought of his pathetic muggle father.</p><p>It had made him want to taste her and strangle her all at once.</p><p>With seconds to spare, Tom threw on his cloak, stepped out into the street in the pouring rain, and apparated.</p>

</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Today was <em> not </em> Tom’s day.</p><p>From his pent-up exhaustion, to his accidental nap, to his disturbing dreams, then the foreboding weather…</p><p>He stepped into the Minister’s 1930s home, a three-story brick structure. It reminded him somewhat of Grimmauld Place, except that it was standalone and was much less… well, <em> grim </em>. </p><p>As he’d crossed over the threshold and was suddenly thrust into the throes of social introductions, he saw that across the drawing room stood one of his least favorite people in existence… Alphard Black.</p><p>The bloke looked quite smug, leaning against the sidebar with a brandy in hand, staring at Tom as if he’d known Tom would be there.</p><p>He probably <em> fucking </em> had... the cunt. </p><p>Tom found himself surrounded by a gaggle of women, all shaking his hand and smiling coyly until the Minister himself approached. Riddle had met him at Malfoy Manor some months back, so they reacquainted themselves politely until he saw <em> her </em> across the room.</p><p>He should’ve anticipated she might be here, but the blasted witch somehow had a way of frequently surprising him.</p><p>Hermione Dumbledore stood with Winifred Bones and Aeris Flint, two of his Hogwarts schoolmates who now worked at the Ministry of Magic. Tom was asked by <em> someone </em> if he would like a glass of <em> something </em> (“most definitely, firewhiskey, if you have it”) and Tom shook the hand of another <em> someone </em> whose name he instantly forgot as he allowed his gaze to trail down Hermione's body in a lengthy appraisal.</p><p>She wore a fashionable black lace dress with cap sleeves and a hem that ended mid-calf. The lace was see-through around her shoulders, having a scalloped slip sewn in that ended just below her collarbone. She wore long black gloves of silk, black pumps, and red lipstick.</p><p>Her lips looked like rose petals and he wanted to smear that lipstick all over her face.</p><p>At that moment, her gaze drifted over to his corner of the room and their eyes met. Her mouth fell slightly open in surprise, but it was a soft sort of uncertainty and bore no hint of the animosity she’d shown him the other day, prior to her meeting at the Ministry.</p><p>It felt as though it were years since they’d locked eyes, despite the fact that it had only been days, or a week, or two weeks; Tom had really lost track.</p><p>Tom didn’t smile, nod, or acknowledge her in any way other than to stare into her eyes, his black irises burning into her whiskey-colored ones like smoldering coals.</p><p>She closed her mouth after a moment, then cleared her throat and looked away.</p><p>Tom turned aside to find Alphard Black staring at him.</p><p>Black was probably the only Slytherin he’d gone to school with that he could barely tolerate.</p><p>Tom and Alphard were quite similar with regard to their physical attributes. Alphard was a few inches shorter than Tom, but Tom was quite tall, and both were pale and had black hair, although Alphard’s was straight and he always wore it slicked back, whereas Tom’s was curled and parted so that it spilled over his forehead.</p><p>Their eyes differed, however. Tom’s were so dark they were almost black, and Alphard possessed brilliant blue eyes like his sister Walburga. But in fourth year, he developed heterochromia due to a quidditch injury, causing his left eye to stay iridescently blue and his right to darken into an inky, charcoal grey.</p><p>They’d been school rivals, barring that Tom had bested him at everything and anything they competed in.</p><p>When they dueled in fifth year, Tom had defeated him with a NEWT-level mind magic illusion, causing Alphard to believe he was casting a different spell than he actually had. No one had ever beaten Tom in a duel, however, so it wasn’t much of a contest.</p><p>They battled it out over their class scores, but Alphard always came in second.</p><p>Alphard seemed to want to make everything a competition, knowing that Tom would always rise to the challenge.</p><p>The competition never bothered Tom.</p><p>Nor did Alphard’s complete disdain for the Knights of Walpurgis. </p><p>What infuriated Riddle was Alphard’s casual acceptance of defeat and his smugness toward Tom which seemed to say, “Good for you, you won, you may always win, but at the end of the day you’re still a poor, orphaned half-blood with no social status or familial ties.” Alphard knew that Tom would have to work for everything he would ever possess, whereas Alphard could sit back despite whatever happened in his life, never needing to work, living off the Black family wealth, and the prestige that followed his ancient, pureblood lineage.</p><p>It enraged Tom to no end that Alphard was currently whiling away his time on elaborate world travels, partying with French socialites from Beauxbatons, and attending Quidditch matches with box seats, while Tom’s only desire was to <em>learn</em>. To grow in his magical knowledge and power. To push the boundaries of what one wizard could accomplish through magic. To <em>build</em> <em>something</em> that the world would be forced to recognize. To incite a <em>revolution</em>. </p><p>And yet, he was wasting his time working to pay for a leaky flat.</p><p>Not that he didn’t have plenty of time. He would have nothing but time when it was all said and done. That was one thing all these precious pureblood princes couldn’t take away from Tom. His horcruxes.</p><p><em> Immortality </em>.</p><p>The primary reason that Tom had fucked Walburga in the first place was to get under Alphard’s skin.</p><p>Tom looked away coldly from the sod’s mismatched eyes and made his way to the dining room.</p><p>The seating of the dinner party had already been decided. Alphard had been seated next to Hermione. Tom was seated diagonally from her. The Minister sat two seats down from them. Wilhelmina Tuft sat beside Tom.</p><p>There were twenty guests in all.</p><p>Tom observed that Alphard and Hermione had seemingly already met prior to his late arrival. Hermione spoke mutedly with Winnie Bones and answered Alphard’s questions politely. The conversation waxed political at one point, and the Minister had a heated debate with Flint over some mermaid legislation that had been up in the air for nearly eighty years which Tom could care less about it. Wilhelmina asked Tom quiet questions about Hogwarts and about his future goals, about his relationships with some of his Death Eaters, as well as Abraxas (he did not refer to them as Death Eaters in public). </p><p>Tom and Hermione did not speak. </p><p>As the dinner progressed, and Wilhelmina sat sharing softly with Tom about her political campaign, he flicked his eyes up to catch hold of Hermione’s gaze and he held it there for the better part of ten seconds. He could have been imagining it, but he felt as though she were conceding something. She didn’t look away until Tom broke the contact. Then, she seemed to release her breath, as if she’d been holding it the entire time, unable to look away until he released her.</p><p>It felt like a promise.</p><p>He could not explain what it was that was building between them, but whatever it was, it was steadily becoming irreversible.</p><p>Once Tom set his sights on something it became an obsession, a relentless pursuit.</p><p>Tom refused to look at her again.</p><p>As the dinner came to an end, Minister Moon stood as the house-elves filled everyone’s goblets with vintage wine. He lifted his goblet in the air.</p><p>“If I may make a toast, please, raise your glasses. As you all know, I have been quite the champion of witches’ careers during my administration. In these times, it is imperative that we begin to support the success and promotion of witches. I have invited here tonight three extremely accomplished and promising young ladies who I believe will make a radical difference in our society. These are not simply career-driven witches, but witches with foresight, vision, and bravery! Miss Bones,” he inclined his head toward the redheaded witch, “has proven herself to be a force in the field of healing. She has crafted several state-of-the-art medicinal potion brews and her own <em> unique </em> diagnostic spells for blood curses, which have been incredibly tricky to determine for our St. Mungo’s nurses. Miss Bones, we recognize your advances in healing this year and we look forward to incredible things from you in the future."</p><p>There was a round of soft clapping as the witch demured and inclined her head in appreciation.</p><p>Minister Moon continued, "You all know that I have been Minister for nearly ten years now. I have presided over the Global Wizarding War and simultaneously, a muggle World War as well. I have maintained excellent relations with the muggle Prime Minister, Mr. Churchill, and I hope to see those same well-maintained bridges intact as we cross into a new decade. Mrs. Wilhelmina Tuft is a strong and capable witch, and all of us here,” he gestured around, chuckling conspiratorially, “we all know that she is a shoo-in, and I have given her my endorsement. I pray that you will usher the British wizarding community into a time of peace and prosperity, unity, and understanding. It is my desire that muggles and wizards would co-exist peacefully and without hatred for one another…”</p><p><em> It will never happen, </em> Tom thought. <em> As pretty a painting as that may be, it won’t ever be real </em>.</p><p>Tom knew that wizardkind would remain just as fickle and self-absorbed as they’d always been.</p><p>He looked at Hermione, staring rapt as the Minister made this speech, her eyes glistening.</p><p>It struck him that she truly believed in this vision and that she was passionate to see it come to fruition.</p><p><em> That, I suppose, is the difference, </em> he thought, <em> between an idealist and a realist. </em></p><p>He determined that he would always speak the truth to her, whether she hated him for it or not.</p><p>“... which leads me to my honored guest tonight. Miss Hermione Jean Dumbledore. I think I speak for everyone here, Miss Dumbledore, when I say that we at the Ministry, as well as the wizarding population at large, were all waiting with bated breath to see what would become of the daughter of the great Albus Dumbledore. I must say that you have undeniably exceeded my every expectation. I hope,” he glanced pointedly at Tuft, “that you will continue to harbor a strong working relationship with the Ministry of Magic moving forward, as your influence grows and continue to shed light on ways that we might improve our operations and make life for witches and wizards better. You have, most impressively, uncovered a breach of contract between the goblins and the ministry and set in motion the building of a new wizarding bank. Everyone, please give a round of applause for the creation of the Ministry-approved financial institution, Midas Enterprises!"</p><p>There was a round of applause around the table. Tom smiled to himself, secretly impressed with <em>his</em> little witch.</p><p>"Now, as you seem to have a fondness and passion for the muggle world, I would like to formally extend an invitation to you, Miss Dumbledore, to become the Ministry’s liaison to the muggle world. I would like to humbly request that you would act in the role and position of Ambassador of Muggle Relations. This would include a seat as a representative on the council of the International Confederation of Wizards. This will be my final appointment as Minister for Magic during my term.”</p><p>Hermione’s face was frozen as she stared at Minister Moon. Tom pressed his tongue against his cheek.</p><p>After a moment, Hermione seemed to rouse and looked about her at the faces around the table, her mouth falling open slightly as she searched for words.</p><p>“Oh, <em> my </em>,” she said with no small amount of shock. “I- I have no words. What a great honor you bestow upon me, Minister. I think I’m in a bit of shock, really.”</p><p>The Minister chuckled and waved his hand. “Now, there will be no need for you to abandon your position as a writer for <em> The Daily Prophet, </em>certainly. It would be a tragedy to draw you away from that for which you have so much talent and natural affinity. Please, take your time in deliberating over this invitation. I simply wanted to make it known to our group here, as the faces you see around you will all become important political forces in the coming years. I pray that despite any differences in beliefs and points of view, we can all join hands in making the magical world safer and more stable in the years to come.”</p><p>“Thank you, Minister. I’m so honored. You pay me the highest possible compliment.”</p><p>Minister Moon smiled at her and lifted his glass, meeting the eyes of every face at his table, and said cheerfully, “To magic!”</p><p>Tom saw out of the corner of his eye that Wilhelmina was looking at Hermione curiously, with a slight narrowing of her green eyes.</p><p>As everyone toasted, Alphard Black shot Tom a smug look, inclined his head, and sipped his wine.</p><p>When dinner concluded, the company drifted back to the drawing room. Hermione, Winnie Bones, Wilhelmina, and the Minister’s wife all sat in a sitting area speaking softly and several of the men were standing around the sidebar, enjoying a few choice cigars, and pipes filled with Veela leaves that were sold at a shop on Horizont Alley.</p><p>Tom was ready to leave. He’d had quite enough of the simpering smiles and political pretenses. It all made him want to act out and curse someone. Probably Alphard, if he had his pick.</p><p>He decided he would use the blood-boiling curse.</p><p>Or perhaps he would use his most recent experiment. It was a modification of the summoning charm which allowed him to rip an organ from his enemy’s body; he thought of summoning Black's blood-soaked heart directly into his waiting hand.</p><p>Tom’s lips turned up slightly.</p><p>“Good to see you again, Tom. It’s been a year or two.” Tom recognized the false congeniality of Black’s voice instantly and cocked his head only slightly in his direction.</p><p>Black had approached Tom where he was standing at the bar, slightly to the side of the rest of the group.</p><p>“Black,” Tom muttered in acknowledgment. He said nothing else.</p><p>Alphard chuckled. “You’re as charming as ever, Riddle.”</p><p>Tom took a sip of his firewhiskey. “Are you desperate for my attention, Black?”</p><p>Alphard smirked. “I saw you looking at Miss Dumbledore earlier.”</p><p>“Did you now?”</p><p>“I thought it an <em> interesting </em> bit of eye contact,” Alphard drawled.</p><p>Tom took another sip of whiskey. It burned his chest. He’d imbibed more alcohol than he’d intended tonight. “I’m still waiting for you to say something relevant, Black.”</p><p>Alphard shrugged. “She’s a sensational witch. Wouldn’t you agree?”</p><p>Tom’s face was a blank mask as he looked at Alphard challengingly. He said nothing. </p><p>Alphard’s expression became smug. “I don’t believe I’ve <em> ever </em> known you to have eyes for a witch, Riddle. Save for my sister, of course. I’d almost begun to wonder if you and Abraxas had taken up together.”</p><p>Tom smirked. “Let me be clear, Black. I’ve <em> never </em> had eyes for your sister. Cock, yes. Eyes.. no.”</p><p>Alphard’s eyes hardened, then his lips pinched into a tight smile. “You’ve always been a son of bitch, Riddle.”</p><p>Tom cocked a brow, inclining his head. “I don’t disagree with you.”</p><p>Alphard turned and requested a gillywater from the house elf behind the bar. He took the crystal glass and sipped it in silence, then gestured to Hermione where she sat across the room. “Do you know her, then?”</p><p>Riddle’s jaw ticked. “We are acquainted, yes.”</p><p>Alphard lowered his eyes and rolled his tongue along his cheek. “My sister seems to truly… despise the girl.”</p><p>“I’m not sure exactly what gave you the impression that I care about who Walburga likes or does not like.”  Tom imagined himself summoning Alphard’s heart. He thought of how it would look in his hands, still beating and dripping a thick, dark crimson onto the carpet.</p><p>Alphard shrugged. “It’s just unusual, the amount of hate she seems to harbor toward her.”</p><p>Tom rolled his neck and then glanced at Alphard impatiently. “Since when is it unusual for Walburga to dislike someone? I imagine she harbors disdain for Hermione’s progressive views on blood purity. Walburga dislikes anyone who doesn’t line up with her blood-purist ideologies.”</p><p>Alphard gave a cynical laugh. “It’s true. Which is why it quite befuddles me, then, why she likes you, half-blood, of all people.”</p><p>Tom smiled coldly. “I wouldn’t expect you to understand this,” Tom muttered as he tossed back his whiskey and sat the glass on the bar behind them. “But cock can work miracles, Black. That is, <em> if </em> you know how to use it.”</p><p>Alphard lifted his chin, his nostrils flaring the only indication that Riddle has gotten under his skin.<br/><br/>At that, the conversation was severed because the group of witches had stood and were making their way back to mingle with the group of men.</p><p>Alphard moved to gallantly pull up a seat for Hermione, offering to grab her another drink from the bar, for which she smiled and thanked him. </p><p>Then he took a seat beside Hermione, proceeding to chat with her conspiratorially about her new offer as Ambassador of Muggle Relations.</p><p>Tom decided he would kill Alphard Black.</p><p>He would have to be delicate about it, considering his standing in society. Perhaps poison.</p><p>“-I’m very fond of muggle culture, actually,” Black drawled.</p><p>“<em>Really</em>?” Hermione’s face registered her surprise.</p><p>“Oh, yes.”</p><p>“That surprises me.”</p><p>“Does it?” He feigned hurt. “Is it because I’m a Black?”</p><p>“Er- Well…” she appeared to be holding back laughter.</p><p>Alphard shot her a winning smile. “No, I don’t blame you. Not at all. I used to be very staunch about my views on blood purity. Then I went to New York City. Have you ever been?”</p><p>Hermione’s eyes sparkled. “I confess, I haven’t.”</p><p>“Oh, you’d love it.” He grinned. “Especially Harlem. The music, the art, the jazz… the dancing. You’ll never have the same night twice. It’s a unique experience all its own. I’ve become very fond of muggle music. I imagine a people that could create something so beautiful and soul-wrenching, couldn’t be all that bad. America has a very different approach to muggle relations than Britain. Ah, and New Orleans, the blending of muggle and wizarding culture there is absolutely superb. If you ever decide to go, I would be more than happy to escort you. I know the <em> best </em> spots.” He winked, eliciting a warm laugh from Hermione.</p><p>Riddle thought he might actually rip the bastard’s heart out in front of the Minister for Magic. He was powerful enough that he could duel all twelve wizards and then obliviate them all after. He ground his teeth as he contemplated it, imagining every possibility and outcome, running through each witch or wizard in the room and their abilities and strengths, predicting what spell they would cast, how he would counter, what curses would be most effective, etc. He thought this way very often, actually, everywhere he went. He rarely stopped thinking about magic, truthfully.</p><p>Instead of giving in to his baser urges, he pacified himself with a plan to poison Alphard. Perhaps a Bloodroot poison, or a tea infused with Runespoor fang.</p><p>Perhaps he would wait until he’d found the diadem. He’d relish creating a horcrux using Alphard’s corpse.</p><p>Or better yet, he could wait until he’d found a relic belonging to Salazar Slytherin himself. They were both Slytherins, so it would be quite fitting, Tom supposed.</p><p>Tom’s gaze wandered to Hermione’s ankles, thinking to himself that they were quite delicate.</p><p>A few minutes passed, and Tom decided he’d had a bit too much to drink, and he was ready to head home. He had work early and now needed to wake a bit earlier to pour over his textbook on deadly potions and poisons.</p><p>Tom made his way over to where the Minister and Minister-to-be stood and began to say his goodbyes.<br/><br/></p><hr/><p> </p><p>Hermione watched as Tom Riddle began to say farewell to Minister Moon, and she felt a pang of irritation as Wilhelmina Tuft placed her hand on Tom’s arm, promising to owl him.</p><p>Alphard Black was in her ear, droning on about a deadly vampire commune in New Orleans, but Hermione couldn’t take her eyes off Riddle.</p><p>They’d not spoken a single word to each other since he’d arrived, and Hermione couldn’t help feeling a bit let down by the fact.</p><p>He had only looked at her once or twice, and when he did, Hermione felt as if he had gripped her by the throat, holding her frozen there, locked in the soullessness of his black eyes.</p><p>But why did she want him to speak to her? To look at her with some kind of acknowledgment?</p><p><em> So you can get close to him, </em> she thought to herself. <em> You have to get his horcruxes. You have to kill him. </em></p><p>She wondered to herself what Tom thought of the Minister’s speech and his offer to her of the muggle relations position. He presumably <em> despised </em> muggles. He murdered them quite callously and without thought, in the future. He rounded up muggle-borns. <em> She </em> was muggle-born. Hermione found herself contemplating how he would react if he knew her true blood status. She wondered <em> how </em> he became that uncompromisingly evil being that she’d feared in her time. A man who would kill an infant because of a <em> prophecy </em>. The man she saw now seemed so far removed from that reality that she felt she might have dreamt it up.</p><p>She turned back to Alphard Black and smiled, nodded, although she had effectively tuned out the last few minutes of whatever he had been rambling about. She felt bad about it. He was quite interesting, after all, and this was the uncle that Sirius had mentioned he was rather fond of. The only family member, besides Tonks and Andromeda, that Sirius had spoken highly of. Hermione knew that he had died of a mysterious illness, or rather “unknown causes” sometime in the late 1970s, leaving Sirius a hefty sum of gold, which allowed him to leave home at a tender age. It saddened her somewhat to imagine the handsome wizard beside her passing away so young.</p><p>He <em> was </em> quite handsome, she realized. His peculiar eyes even added to that attractiveness, lending him a mysterious quality. </p><p>Hermione watched as Tom Riddle left the room. After a moment, she too, decided it was time to leave.</p><p>“I think I shall turn in for the night,” she murmured to Alphard. She was tired, after all, it had been a long day.</p><p>“Of course,” he said, eyes searching her face. “I’ll walk you out.”</p><p>Hermione said her goodbyes and they made their way together to the foyer, grabbing their cloaks and wands from the house-elf who acted as a doorman. She was walking out of the front door when Alphard was held up in the foyer by Aeris Flint. She decided she would wait for him just outside, so she closed the door behind her and turned to make her way down the steps. </p><p>Tom Riddle was still outside, standing unnaturally erect on the sidewalk with his back to her, seemingly staring at nothing, lost in thought. When she closed the door, he twisted around to the sound, watching her with a guarded expression, betraying that he hadn’t expected her to leave so soon.</p><p>She descended the steps from the stoop and stopped on the sidewalk to face Tom. He stood sideways, but his head was turned toward her.</p><p>Hermione stood very still; she held one hand awkwardly away from her body, her palm flat and fingers spread in the empty air, like it was resting against a wall. </p><p>She observed Tom’s lips and the contempt in the shape of his mouth, the planes and hollows of his pale cheeks and structured jawline, and the cold, pure gleam of his eyes that held no signs of empathy.</p><p>He was so sharp and serrated, dressed in all black save for a crisp white shirt and black tie; his black and gold Gaunt ring glinted unnaturally in the light of the streetlamp. Hermione thought that he looked like the edge of a knife that might either sharpen her or cut her wide open.</p><p>His nostrils flared; then his eyes, now marbled with crimson, dragged down her body with painstaking slowness, an act of ownership. Hermione’s heart beat violently against her ribs.</p><p>When his eyes slid back up to meet hers, she felt warm fingers wrap around her throat. She gasped, lifting her hand to her throat but felt nothing there.</p><p>She looked back to Riddle and his lips were turned upward at the corners in the barest hint of a smirk.</p><p>The door opened, and Hermione turned to find Alphard Black strolling through the doorway. </p><p>When she looked back, Riddle was gone.</p><p>Alphard jauntily descended the steps. “What was that?”</p><p>Hermione cleared her throat. “What was what?” She was slightly breathless.</p><p>“Thought I saw Tom.”</p><p>She shook her head dismissively. “I suppose he was just leaving.”</p><p>He approached and took her hand, bowing low before her and pressing a kiss to the silk of her glove. “It was an absolute delight to meet you, Miss Dumbledore.”</p><p>She gave him a genuine smile in return. “I feel the same way. I’m not sure how we managed to avoid one another up until now.”</p><p>His smile was dazzling. “Perhaps they’ve been hiding you from me.”</p><p>Hermione laughed. “Believe it or not, I’m not really much for social engagements. I prefer my books and my quill, unfortunately.”</p><p>He ran his fingers through his inky black hair. “Then I suppose you absolutely abhor Quidditch matches.”</p><p>She tilted her head this way and that. “I don’t think <em> abhor </em> is the word… I more or less <em> abstain </em> from them. I’ve been romantically linked to a few quidditch players in my time and I’ve discovered they’re not exactly my cup of tea.”</p><p>“Ahh,” he groaned, biting his lip. “So she has a soft spot for athletes!”</p><p>“No, no, <em> no </em> ,” Hermione chided. “I fear they must be the <em> type </em> of men that are drawn to me, unfortunately.”</p><p>“I have a feeling there are many types of men that are drawn to you, Miss Dumbledore.”</p><p>Hermione felt heat creeping into her cheeks. “Please call me Hermione.”</p><p>“Well, <em> Hermione </em>.” He waved his hand, conjuring two slips of paper that appeared to be tickets. “I just so happen to have box seats to a quidditch match this coming Saturday. The Kestrels are playing the Magpies, so I figured being from Edinburgh you might be a Montrose fan. But alas, I appear to have been sorely mistaken.”</p><p>Hermione fought back a smile.</p><p>His mismatched eyes glittered, the ghostly blue eye piercing her and the charcoal eye laughing with mirth. “I would invite you to go, but I’m afraid some beef headed beater might snatch you away from me.”</p><p>Hermione shook her head, giving an incredulous huff of laughter. “Oh, you’re dreadful. Why ever would I say yes after you’ve sufficiently mocked me?”</p><p>He grinned. “Because I’ll introduce you to Bodie Watkins. <em> Very </em> famous seeker for the Magpies. Then I’ll take you for drinks after.”</p><p>Hermione nodded, inclining her head as if considering. “I’d like to say yes, but I feel I must inform you… I don’t think your sister cares for me very much.”</p><p>He rolled his eyes. “If you’re going to tell me no, at least let it be because you don’t want to go… Don’t pretend it’s because of my sister.”</p><p>“That’s not it at all! I just wanted to give you fair warning. I <em> would </em> love to go!”</p><p>He gazed at her. “Is that a yes?”</p><p>Hermione nodded demurely. “It is.”</p><p>He grinned. “I will owl you then. Now go, apparate out of here before the Minister comes out and starts adding more prestigious titles to your repertoire.”</p><p>This time, Hermione rolled her eyes. "Do you tease everyone this much? Or just me?"<br/><br/>Alphard bent down (he was quite tall), bringing his eyes level with her own, and gazed at her with a very stern expression. "Leave some prestige for the rest of us, <em>Hermione</em>. You can't have it <em>all</em>."<br/><br/>Hermione laughed and Alphard thought to himself that he liked the sound of her laughter very much. He watched her apparate, admiring her ankles before she turned on her heel and disappeared with a soft clap.<br/><br/><br/></p>

<p>Tom knelt, gazing down at the city of Edinburgh. Magical energy crackled around him like static electricity. A warm breeze caressed his face, and his eyes were cold and hard, glowing bright red with triumph. He was a bit dizzy and lightheaded, but ultimately, his endeavor had been thus far victorious.</p><p>He’d <em>fucking</em> done it.</p><p>Now, all he had to do was feed that power and grow in his abilities.</p><p>Tom’s research of late had waxed theoretical, and he found himself studying in the early mornings before work, combing the ancient texts relating to Merlin, or <em>Myrddin’s</em> life and magic, his abilities at shapeshifting, potion brewing, and prophecy. He had read Geoffrey of Monmouth’s texts, and was currently studying <em>Myrdhinn, ou l'Enchanteur Merlin </em>by La Villemarqué, <em>L’Morte d'Arthur</em>, and <em>The Mystique of Merlin</em> by Cesar Pontieu, but found himself unable to locate any evidence of a particular rumor which one would hear amongst the Celtic witches of Scotland: that Merlin had achieved cross-continental apparation.</p><p>Tom had not heard of a witch or wizard alive who had accomplished that particular feat of magic.</p><p>It was difficult enough to apparate great distances within one’s own country. Not only that, but one typically had to apparate to somewhere one had <em> already been before </em>.</p><p>But, in theory, Merlin had been able to apparate <em> anywhere </em> in the world, regardless of whether he’d already traveled to that place or not. The distance was of no consequence.</p><p>To apparate great distances would be tricky. Most wizards that attempted it were either killed or severely injured.</p><p>Tom salivated at the thought of being able to learn such a practice.</p><p>Tom had been practicing this skill for quite some time; he was determined to achieve fluency in its very subtle nuances.</p><p>Tom didn’t care if he splinched himself. He didn’t care if he was injured. He <em> would </em> be the only wizard in this time to successfully apparate across continents.</p><p>He had first wanted to test the theory that he could apparate to a location he had not been to before and was not familiar with. He began with short distances, keeping a rather expensive vial of Essence of Dittany with him in case he splinched himself. One had to have some sort of connection with the place, perhaps an acquaintance, a past history, or a mental picture of the terrain.</p><p>Tom had apparated successfully to a magical street in London that he had never visited, Vertic Alley, with merely a focus on the name of a shop that was owned by his Slytherin colleague, Upton Stoddard. He was rather pleased with himself that day, and had treated himself and Stoddard to a firewhiskey at<em> The White Wyvern </em> , and then paid a visit to S <em> hyverwretch’s Venoms and Poisons </em> in search of a quality Runespoor fang to hang onto in case he did, indeed, decide to poison the Black bastard. He might fucking dose Walburga too, just for spite.</p><p>Slowly, Tom began to increase his range of apparation. In his future planning, he had intended that once he had discovered the relics of each Hogwarts founder and created his final horcruxes (provided that it worked; he still was unsure if it was possible to split one's soul seven times) he would travel for several years, taking a space of time to search for Ravenclaw’s diadem in Albania. There, he had intended to study the dark arts with a wizard named Zephyris<em> , </em> a giant and wizard half-breed who had become infamous for his skill in the field of necromancy and astral projection. Tom was already fairly proficient in the astral arts, but he had caught wind from an Albanian vampire that frequented <em> Borgin and Burkes, </em> regarding tales of Zephyris’ ability to infuse his soul with dark magical energy which allowed him to not only take on a spectral form, but a form that resembled real physical matter. In essence, he could project his soul anywhere, at any time, and even take on a tangible form, all while his physical body still lay in its original location. It was a fascinating bit of magic, if it was, in fact, true, and Tom was determined to master it. </p><p>In addition, Tom planned to have Dominik Hausler freed from Azkaban, and then he would hide him amongst the giants in Albania. Tom had become friends with the giants in London that had assured him their kin in Albania would welcome any refugees that Tom sent to them. The giants hated muggles, with which they had a rough and bloody history, and therefore, were sympathetic to the cause of Grindelwald. They despised wizards as well, but Tom had spent the last three years building a relationship with a specific community of giants in London.</p><p>Hausler would impart to him the knowledge he possessed of Grindelwald’s experimental magic. He would learn to create <em> inferi </em> . He would discover if one could truly weaponize an <em> obscurus </em>.</p><p>But…</p><p>Tom would need <em> years </em> to accomplish these undertakings.</p><p>He would not be able to stay in London. And he did, in fact, <em> intend </em> to stay in London to discover the secrets of a <em> certain witch.  </em></p><p>
<em> Unless… </em>
</p><p>He could become fluent in cross-continental apparation.</p><p>Then he would be able to instantly apparate to Albania, and anywhere else he needed to go. Then, he would only have to leave London for weeks at a time.</p><p>Portkey travel was easier and distance was not an issue, but the consent of the Ministry of Magic and various international magical governments was required to set up international portkeys, and Tom didn’t desire any Ministry awareness of his comings and goings, nor did he relish the thought of a stint in Azkaban for something so frivolous.</p><p>So there was really no choice but to attempt the impossible.</p><p>He did not want to leave <em> Hermione </em> for very long.</p><p>He wanted to keep an eye on her.</p><p>Tom had a sneaking suspicion that she had rankled many in the seedy underbelly of Britain’s wizarding community. Particularly the blood purists, dark creatures, and those who opposed the Statute of Secrecy.</p><p><em> His </em> people.</p><p><em> His </em> followers.</p><p>Even his Death Eaters grumbled their dislike of her.</p><p>Riddle had decided that should any harm befall her, it would be by <em> his </em> hand, and no one else’s.</p><p>If anyone laid a hand on the witch, he would kill them, slowly and torturously. He would bring them to the brink of death, again and again, and revive them each time. He would heal them, only to break them again. He would bleed them dry, crucio them beyond physical and mental repair, yet still refrain from releasing their soul into the netherworld until he had sufficiently wrenched every ounce of despair and misery from their cursed being.</p><p>Tom marveled that despite how brief his interactions with the witch had been, he already possessed such an intense sense of ownership over her.</p><p>There was really no help for it. Tom had learned early in life that fighting his obsessions only made them worse. He needed it to be <em> manageable </em>.</p><p>This particular Saturday was his off day, and he’d spent it drinking coffee and smoking his muggle cigarettes, pouring over his texts and tomes, and practicing his spellwork.</p><p>Then, he determined that he would apparate into a nearby country, expanding his range of apparation once more.</p><p>The first place that came to mind was Edinburgh. He had never been before, but he knew that Hermione had purportedly grown up there, and he had a sudden curiosity about the place. He was aware of a particular landmark which was known for possessing high levels of magical energy. It was called Arthur’s Seat, a hill of high elevation that overlooked the city.</p><p>It was nearly 400 miles, a dangerous undertaking.</p><p>He stared at the photo of the landmark in his latest acquisition from the library, <em> Moste Significante Spells and Sorcery of Scotland </em> . Tom memorized the slope of the hill and the jagged cliffs descending to the landscape below. Then, without ceremony, he apparated with a click.<br/>

<b>Wednesday, April 28, 1948</b>
</p><p> </p><p>Hermione stood on the balcony of the Dumbledore cottage in Godric’s Hollow with tears in her eyes. </p><p>Last week, Hermione had been flying high. She had felt as if the sky was the limit for her in 1948. She felt she <em> belonged </em> here. Blueprints for Midas Bank were being drafted and were slated to break ground sometime next year. She’d also officially accepted the role of Ambassador of Muggle Relations at the Ministry and would attend her first meeting of the International Confederation of Wizards in June. Her articles were being lauded and praised throughout London. </p><p>Then, she’d attended a quidditch match on Saturday with Alphard Black and had a genuinely lovely time (Kenmare won, to her pretended dismay). They went out for drinks after, as he’d promised, and he’d made her laugh more than she had in years. She truly hadn’t laughed so hard since before the war… possibly even fourth year...</p><p>Then, as if her luck had run out, as if some dam had finally broken, the following week turned into a nightmare.</p><p>First, the death threats had begun pouring in from scores of outraged goblins. They were owled frequently to her office at <em> The Daily Prophet </em>, but somehow it had leaked that she was staying at Dumbledore’s home in Godric’s Hollow and they’d begun to show up there as well. Several arrests were made and the Department of Magical Law Enforcement had come out to secure the home and install new wards, runes, and magical protections.</p><p>Then, the howlers began to arrive. Minister Moon had announced on Monday that Hermione would act as liaison to the muggle world and for the past two days, howler after howler had arrived from pureblood families and even half-bloods, to her surprise, yelling at her about the dangers of muggles, calling her a blood-traitor, and many other foul names. Her ears still rang from the last one she’d received.</p><p>Finally, as if the week couldn’t get any worse, the widely-read London-based wizarding tabloid, <em> Rumours! </em> , had plastered a photo of herself and Alphard Black on the very front page. Alphard was clapping for a particular play, and Hermione was watching the match with rapt attention. In the moving photograph, they each turned to smile at one another, looking very much like a couple smitten when in reality, they’d just been having a proper good time as new acquaintances. The new friendship was mostly platonic on Hermione’s end, although Black had been quite flirty with her and she wasn’t opposed to <em> anything </em> that might turn her attention from Riddle. Hermione had received several accusatory letters by owl this morning and had been sent along with them, copies of the paper.</p><p>The front page read as follows:<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<b> <em>Dumbledore &amp; Black: Wizarding Royalty, or Royal Fraud?</em> </b>
</p><p><em> Is it a match made in pureblood heaven? Sources say Alphard Black, son of Pollux and Irma Black and heir of the Most Noble and Ancient House of Black, was spotted getting cozy at the Kenmare vs Montrose Quidditch Match this Saturday with none other than Hermione Dumbledore, princess of wizarding London herself! </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> <em> Miss Dumbledore, the recently re-united daughter of Albus Dumbledore &amp; the late Eleanor Dagworth-Granger, was recently named the Ministry of Magic’s Ambassador of Muggle Relations by Minister Leonard Spencer-Moon, and is now the highest-paid columnist at London’s The Daily Prophet. It is rumored that she will be featured in the September issue as Witch Weekly’s Witch of the Year. Our staff has reached out to Witch Weekly for verification but as yet, this claim has neither been confirmed nor denied by the magazine’s public relations team. </em></p><p>
<em> Ironically, Hermione Dumbledore is well-known for her newly spun career as an advocate for muggles and a compassionate voice for muggle-born witches and wizards everywhere. Miss Dumbledore has adamantly rejected what she deems “bigoted blood purity ideologies” and has called for an end to social segregation, prejudices, and “bullying” of muggle-born witches and wizards. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Though Miss Dumbledore espouses such beliefs in poetic words and lyrical language, valiantly moving the hearts of the London wizarding world, one must ask the question: Does Miss Dumbledore adhere to these beliefs for herself? Why would such a witch be found clinging to the arm of the “Prince of Purebloods”?  </em>
</p><p>
<em> A source close to the Black family says, “Alphard Black is a Slytherin through and through. He’s been very vocal in the past about his pureblood elitism, as well as his siblings and parents. I can’t see why a witch like Hermione Dumbledore would want to associate with him based on her political views, but maybe it’s all just for show.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> The Ancient House of Black is well-known for its rigid and unforgiving blood purity stance, being one of the largest, oldest, and wealthiest pure-blooded families in Great Britain, as well as one of the Sacred Twenty-Eight. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Is Hermione Dumbledore a fraud? Can we safely assume that despite her avid entreaties to her readers, she is reluctant to apply those same principles to herself? Does Miss Dumbledore seek to increase her wealth and influence through an advantageous match to the Black heir? </em>

</p><p>“Trash!” Hermione exclaimed. “Complete <em> bloody </em> rubbish!”</p><p>Hermione couldn’t believe her eyes.</p><p>The more she read the article, the more angry she became because she suspected it had the fingerprints of <em> Walburga Black </em>all over it.</p><p>The final straw that split the hippogriff’s back occurred that very morning when an envelope addressed to Hermione had come to her balcony via a large brown owl. Hermione had taken the envelope gingerly, afraid to open it and was contemplating hiring an assistant to sort through her mail, when the envelope transformed into a hissing black snake and almost struck her. </p><p>She had flung the slithering asp off the balcony with a high-pitched scream and stood, seething in anger, her heart racing, tears of rage threatening to spill over onto her cheeks.</p><p>This was absolute. Fucking. <em> Bullshit </em>.</p><p><em> It’s very typical. It comes with the territory, </em> her rational side whispered. </p><p>She knew she had asked for it when she’d charged at the pureblood community, knife in hand, threatening to slaughter their sacred cows.</p><p>But this… this with Walburga wasn’t simply a vendetta born of a political disagreement.</p><p>This was personal. This was <em> bad blood. </em></p><p>Hermione’s vindictive side flared like a spark of fiendfyre.</p><p>This was absolutely the start of a feud between her and Walburga. It was <em> complete </em> bollocks. So what if she’d been seen out with her brother at a quidditch match? That meant <em> nothing </em> . So what if she’d been caught in an almost-kiss with her… er, what <em> was </em> Riddle to Walburga?</p><p>Sudden jealousy sliced through Hermione like an uncomfortably blunt blade. </p><p><em> You don’t care, </em> she thought to herself. <em> You want to kill him. You must kill him.  </em></p><p>Harry and Ron’s faces flooded her mind. She saw Remus and Tonks. She saw Sirius.</p><p>Sirius… he was Walburga’s son.</p><p>Hermione’s life was suddenly feeling awfully <em> complicated </em>.</p><p>She felt she was developing her own pureblood allegiances while simultaneously disagreeing fundamentally with their whole belief systems. She felt she was betraying her friends. Her parents. </p><p>Had she been more focused on her career here than saving her friends? </p><p>No… she had been trying to shift mindsets, alter opinions, and transform hearts with her writings. <em> That </em> was how true change was affected.</p><p>But Hermione had just realized that London politics were very dirty and unfair. She would have to develop a thicker skin and adjust her tactics. She would have to learn to fight dirty as well. If her enemies had opted to be savage and barbaric… well, so would she. Perhaps her time spent around all these <em> Slytherins </em> had begun to rub off on her.</p><p>And then there was Riddle… Hermione did not know what to think of him.</p><p>They weren’t… <em> friends </em>. No, that wasn’t the word.</p><p>They were something <em> else </em>. </p><p>They were nothing…</p><p>But they were also <em> something </em>.</p><p>It was unspoken, and tangible, and terrifying…</p><p>… and she had to kill him.</p><p>She <em> had </em> to.</p><p>There was no other way.</p><p>But how could she continue to denounce pureblood prejudice, and get close to Death Eaters at the same time? The trashy gossip column had already pointed out the farcical discrepancy. That would only put it in people’s minds and cause them to question her character… then to see her hob-knobbing with the pureblood elite would only strengthen their argument.</p><p><em> But how many people truly read such trash anyway? </em>Hermione thought.</p><p>It would be difficult to get close to Riddle when he knew just how she felt and what she believed. They were on exact opposite ends of the spectrum.</p><p>Truthfully, she’d been avoiding any interactions with him. She knew it was her duty to get close to him and steal his horcruxes, and yet…</p><p>She was afraid of herself.</p><p>She was afraid of <em> him </em>.</p><p>She had time, though. She knew he’d only made two horcruxes, and it would be several years before he would make more. </p><p>Hermione’s hands trembled with anxiety. She’d never felt it this badly before.</p><p>She took a deep breath. Then another.</p><p>“I think it's about time,” she muttered, “That I get my own flat.”</p><p>Hermione begged off work, not wanting to go into <em>The Daily Prophet</em> today for fear of what pernicious post that may be awaiting her there. No, she needed a day off desperately, and she knew just what she was going to do.</p><p> </p><hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Hermione drew her black cloak tighter around her form, not wanting to be recognized. She needed a <em> breather </em>. For good measure, she cast a simple transfiguration spell on her face. All of this notoriety was beginning to feel wearisome, and she wanted to browse Carkitt Market in total anonymity. </p><p>She was on her way to meet a witch who would show her several flats on Horizont, Diagon, and Vertic. </p><p>But first, she wanted to make a stop at the market and run a few much-needed errands.</p><p>Carkitt Market was an outdoor market located about a block away from Diagon Alley. The structure was beautiful, framed by an elaborate ceiling of Victorian wrought iron rafters and glass through which one could view the sky. The shops featured handpainted signs, canted bay windows, brightly colored columns, and terraces in brick red and dragon green. In the center of the market stood a small Gothic revival stand with an octagonal turret that steepled toward the sky, <em> Eternelle’s Elixir of Refreshment</em>. </p><p>Hermione first stopped by the Apothecary and replenished her store of medicinal potions, being sure to stock up on Dreamless Sleep, Calming Draught, and another potion that she remembered brewing in her sixth-year Potions class, but had never actually tried herself, Elixir of Euphoria. Perhaps it would alleviate some of her anxiety.</p><p>Then she stopped by the house-elf placement agency. Hermione desperately needed an assistant and didn’t particularly want to deal with another witch or wizard hanging about all the time, but she thought it a very good idea to free and employ a house elf. She wanted to feel like she was doing some good in the world, as she was feeling rather down and depressed of late.<br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p>“Two <em>thousand</em> galleons? That seems awfully steep.”</p><p>“You are purchasing the house-elf for life, Miss Dumbledore. If you are not able to afford it-”</p><p>“Of <em> course </em> , I can afford it. I just cannot fathom the concept of <em> selling </em> another creature for one’s own gain, that’s all.”</p><p>The agent looked at her rather dubiously. “Miss, this practice has been in place for <em> centuries </em>. If you do not like the way things are done in the British wizarding community, then perhaps you would be more comfortable in the mugg-”</p><p>“You’re being very rude to a potential customer,” Hermione interrupted icily. “Simply pair me with an elf, draft the papers, and I’ll be on my way.”</p><p>The agent rolled her eyes. Hermione pursed her lips, determining that she would single-handedly put an end to this <em> tradition </em> in her lifetime.</p><p>“So, you desire an elf that would act in the role of a personal assistant of sorts. Most wizarding families prefer elves skilled in manual labor, housework, cooking, cleaning, and the like. This will require a very specific skillset and we have very few elves experienced in that kind of work. I do believe I have the right elf for your request, however. We will place you with Piksy.” The woman waved her wand, producing a set of vanilla-colored papers with golden seals. “We will need your signature on these documents. This is her magically-binding contract of servitude, identification documents, background check, and health report. As the contract states, once you sign, she will be bound to you for life as well as to the service of your direct blood relatives through a blood-bind. It is an enchantment that is embedded into the house-elves magical core. The elf will also be magically bound to any property whose deed contains the signature of their master. Are you aware of the terms of release? Should you present the elf with <em> any </em> article of clothing, intentionally or otherwise, the contract will be effectively terminated, freeing the house-elf from its binding magic. This does not include jewelry but does include accessories such as hats, scarves, socks, gloves, and the like. Belts are up in the air so it's best to avoid them if at all possible. Do you have any further questions?”</p><p>Hermione had sat staring at the woman blankly as she made this speech, one which she was obviously used to rattling off like a flight attendant giving floating device instructions. Hermione found it all quite degrading and inhumane, but let the woman make her speech all the same.</p><p>“No,” Hermione huffed impatiently. “Now, where is the elf?”</p><p>The woman snapped her fingers, shouting, “<em> Piksy </em> to the assignment desk!”</p><p>Suddenly a <em> pop! </em>resounded through the shop and a tiny little elf with pale skin, bounteous freckles, a few strands of red hair, thick red eyebrows, and glowing yellow-green eyes appeared on top of the desk.</p><p>“Piksy,” the woman muttered somewhat disdainfully, “this is your new master, Miss Dumbledore. Miss Dumbledore, Piksy is a British house elf, but she has served a <em> French </em> family for many years, one who worked in the Bureau de la Justice Magique in Paris. She is proficient in reading and writing and some administrative and clerical work. She should serve your needs well.”</p><p>Hermione smiled warmly at the miniature elf and held out her hand. “Hello, Piksy, I am Hermione. I’m very happy to meet you.”</p><p>The elf looked at her outstretched hand suspiciously, then met Hermione’s gaze with hesitation.</p><p>The agent huffed. “Piksy, you are to shake your new mistress’ hand.”</p><p>“I think we can manage <em> quite </em>well on our own, thank you,” Hermione said contemptuously.</p><p>The elf reached out timidly and shook Hermione’s hand in a weak grip. “Piksy is pleased to meet her new owner, Mistress Dumbledore.”</p><p>“You may call me Miss Dumbledore, or Hermione.” Hermione glanced down at the elf’s clothing, a filthy, threadbare rag that was tied crudely at the shoulder. “And first thing’s first, we need to purchase you some decent clothing and get you freed. Come along, Piksy, there’s a lovely little shop on Vertic Alley that sells children’s robes. They should carry some things in your size.”</p><p>“F-f-freed?” Piksy looked at her new mistress with something almost akin to fear as Hermione signed the documents, sealing the elf’s servitude, albeit temporarily. She doled out the correct amount in galleons and then rolled up the parchments and tucked them under her arm.“Certainly, Piksy. If you’re going to work for me, you’ll decide if you want to do so as a <em> free </em> elf. I know this is a lot to take in all at once, but if you’ll just trust me, I assure you that everything will be just fine.” Hermione looked at Piksy compassionately and reached out her hand. The elf looked doubtful, but she gripped Hermione’s hand and the two apparated away.<br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p>About an hour later, Hermione and Piksy strolled down Horizont Alley hand-in-hand. Piksy's old rags had been replaced by a lightweight sleeveless dress in bright sherbert green. Piksy had at first objected strongly to the idea of being freed and to Hermione's desire to buy her new clothing. Hermione finally had to convince her that the old sack she'd been wearing was an eyesore and offended her eyes, too which Piksy at last relented and hurriedly agreed to swap it out. She refused to wear anything overly complex and was strongly averse to long sleeves (it would interfere with her work, she said), but her eyes kept wandering to the little sleeveless number on a rack in the back of the shop. It was not much different from the cut of her old rags but was a dramatic improvement in style, appeal, and <em>cleanliness, </em>so Hermione bought several in a myriad of colors. Then, she popped into Florean Fortescue's and bought Piksy an ice cream cone, garnering many strange looks from the other patrons. This greatly improved the now-freed elf's spirits and seemed to alleviate the creature's apprehension. The elf practically skipped down the street at Hermione's side, lapping contentedly at her strawberry rhubarb ice cream. Hermione made a note of the creature's preference for sweets.</p><p>Feeling much better and a bit less lonely with the petite and easy-to-please Piksy at her side, Hermione called upon her lawyer, the illustrious Starling Silvanox, who famously won the acquittal of several Azkaban prisoners. In his top-floor office overlooking Diagon Alley, he drafted an employment agreement for Piksy, complete with salary, benefits, <em>and</em> allotted days off. Despite Piksy's indignant opposition and assurance that she would, in fact, <em>not</em> be taking any days off, Hermione insisted that she keep a proper work week with a healthy amount of off-time which Hermione would <em>ensure</em> that she observed.<br/>
<br/>
After the contract of employment was signed by both parties, Hermione set off with her new administrative assistant to tour several flats in the wizarding district of London. After hours of deliberation, Hermione finally settled on the private suite of a very well-guarded, historic, and prestigious quarter of Horizont Alley. The entrance, much like the Ministry of Magic, was located in a phone booth, which one had to dial into to gain admittance. Hermione had an entire floor to herself, with floor-to-ceiling windows and a balcony featuring a lovely stone mermaid fountain, a pond filled with silver seahorses, and a garden in which grew many flowers and potions ingredients, namely nightshade, monkshood, wolfs-bane, and other herbs. Most notable among its virtues was its mail center, where there worked a few friendly squibs that sorted through the daily post.</p><p>At the end of the day, she apparated back to Godric's Hollow with Piksy. Hermione was exhausted, but it was a victorious sort of fatigue as she was quite pleased with how much she'd accomplished in one day. She determined that she would move her belongings into the new flat over the weekend.<br/>
<br/>
Hermione finally collapsed into bed that evening and dosed herself with Dreamless Sleep. As she was drifting off, her mind wandered to Riddle, and she wondered if he were having as foul a week as she was. She smiled gleefully to herself and hoped that he was.</p>

<h2 class="heading">Prelude to a Kiss</h2>
</div>

<div class="userstuff">
<p align="center"><em> Every loneliness is a pinnacle </em> - Ayn Rand</p><p> </p><p>Hermione woke in Godric’s Hollow on Monday morning, feeling much more chipper than she had last week. Her Sunday afternoon training session with Dumbledore and Lucky had gone very well, and Albus had elected that they could move on to training in other forms of magic, provided that Hermione continued to practice her occlumency skills with her own house elf, Piksy. </p><p>After their lesson in his office at Hogwarts, Hermione had left the castle and strode out to the Black Lake, spread out like a rippling dark mirror reflecting the mountains and the forest. She stared out at the quidditch pitch, marveling that so little had truly changed since her time, so many years in the future. Hermione sprawled out onto the grass, flung out like a cross on the warm earth, feeling empty and flattened under the weight of the sun.</p><p>She thought of Harry and Ron, and the Weasleys, and her parents. She thought of Ginny. What had they done when they discovered Hermione was gone? Had Ron mourned her? Had he wept for her? Had they felt <em> abandoned </em> by her?</p><p>Hermione knew that she was not the same person after the war. She’d known it before she had even scrawled that cursed incantation across the parchment and journeyed back in time. </p><p>She thought of her strange encounter with Madame Violette in The Leaky Cauldron, and the cards that still burned in her beaded bag. The weight of fate began to press upon her like a force, threatening to stifle her. It didn’t matter that the object had been created by Voldemort himself. Because the object had not been used as he had intended, that much was clear. There was a reason that <em> Hermione </em> had come across it. The universe, the gods, fate, or some higher power had sent her here, to this time. There was <em> something </em> she was to accomplish. She had thought that her purpose was clear: kill Voldemort, and undermine the evil seeds he had planted, the disastrous movement he had created. But now, Hermione felt that there was something much bigger than even Voldemort. She felt a quickening around herself, the aid of some amorphous magical energy that propelled her. </p><p>She thought of the cards.</p><p><em> The Tower </em>… a violent upheaval.</p><p><em> Death </em>… the ending of a cycle, and the start of something new.</p><p><em> The Five of Wands </em>… conflict and competition.</p><p><em> The Lovers and The Two of Cups </em>… soulmates.</p><p><em> Judgement </em>… metamorphosis. A spiritual journey to one’s higher self.</p><p>The cards troubled Hermione. She had been ripped from her fate in one life and been thrust into an alternate destiny, and already, after only three months, she felt her old life begin to fade… a distant memory. Unreachable. Unattainable. Best forgotten.</p><p>She missed them all terribly. She missed Luna, George, and Mrs. Weasley’s cooking. She missed the familiarity of having people who truly knew and loved her.</p><p>Here, nobody truly knew her.</p><p>It was both a blessing and a curse. </p><p>The better people know you, the more they put you in a box. Here, Hermione felt invincible. She felt as though she were able to reach her full potential, to gain power, and influence. People respected her here because they didn’t <em>know</em> her. They wouldn’t label her as a swot or a novelty (her magic is remarkable for a <em>muggle-born</em>). She wasn’t thrown into the box of Harry and Ron’s “motherly” friend, the one with the brains, always with her nose in a book, a walking encyclopedia, an insufferable know-it-all. </p><p>Here, Hermione was a force. She possessed ideas and <em> vision </em>. She was influential; or rather, she would be one day. People saw her differently.</p><p>Tom Riddle <em> saw </em> her. She didn’t exactly know <em> what </em> he saw when he looked at her, but every time he gazed at her with those obsidian eyes, she felt <em> seen </em> . Understood. <em> Desired </em>, even.</p><p>She shook away the dangerous line of thought.</p><p>Despite the respect she was garnering as Dumbledore’s daughter, as a prodigious writer, a political power, and a witch to watch… she was lonely. </p><p>… and loneliness was dangerous.</p><p>This morning, however, she had awoken feeling different. She felt sharp, like the edge of a scythe, poised to reap the souls of her enemies. <em> Let them test me, </em> she thought. <em> I will show them just who Hermione Granger is. </em></p><p>It had taken her longer to furnish her flat and move her things than she anticipated, but tonight would be her final night in Dumbledore’s cottage. Albus had congratulated her on finding her own place and promised to stop by for tea and scones at his earliest convenience.</p><p>Hermione’s owl Perdita rapped on the window with her beak, prompting her to open the window and retrieve her morning papers. Hermione gazed at her latest editorial with pride on the front page of The Daily Prophet as she sipped her tea: <b> <em>Life, Re-incarnated: Spectres, Soul-Mates, and Startling Stories about Second Lives.</em> </b></p><p>She read her article again (just to be sure the copy editor was performing to standard) and then pulled out her daily copy of <em> Rumours!. </em></p><p>She’d purchased her own subscription to the trashy gazette so that she could keep an eye on whatever lies they were perpetuating about her. Sure enough, there, on the front page, was a photograph of Hermione and… <em> Piksy </em>?</p><p>The photograph portrayed Hermione and Piksy walking down the street in Vertic Alley. It must have been taken immediately after they had left the assignment desk in Carkitt Market, as Piksy still wore her old tattered rags.</p><p> The article read as follows:</p><p>
<b> <em>Hermione’s House-Elf Hoax!</em> </b>
</p><p><em> Miss Dumbledore is at it again! For several weeks now, Rumours! has been following the lies and inconsistencies of journalist and London socialite, Hermione Dumbledore. Only weeks prior to this photograph being taken, Miss Dumbledore published an article on the front page of The Daily Prophet entitled </em> <b> <em>House Elves or House Slaves?</em> </b> <em> Miss Dumbledore has been seemingly shedding light on what she considers to be an old and outdated practice, bewailing the inhumane treatment of house elves, the unethical system of slavery, and the moral failings of our wizarding community as a whole.  </em></p><p>
<em> After calling for the freedom of house elves everywhere, Hermione urges witches and wizards to employ their elves with a living wage, scheduling days off, and even providing them with clothing and personal property, thus salvaging the dignity of what she calls a “powerful, loyal, and stout-hearted race.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> However, Hermione has a history of saying one thing, and doing another entirely! This past Wednesday afternoon, Hermione Dumbledore was spotted in Carkitt Market in the act of purchasing her very own house elf for no less than two thousand galleons. Pictured above is Miss Dumbledore and her unnamed elf strolling down Vertic Alley- </em>
</p><p>Hermione promptly folded the paper in half, refusing to read the remainder of the article. She did not get angry, or lose her temper. She simply folded the paper, sat it on the table, and continued to drink her tea. </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Later that morning, Hermione made her way to her desk on the second floor of <em> The Daily Prophet.  </em></p><p>“Good morning, Hermione!” said her friend and fellow writer, Eulessia Baron. “Tea?”</p><p>“Oh, yes, please,” Hermione smiled. She made her way to Eulessia’s desk. “I actually wanted to speak to you about something.”</p><p>“Of course. What is it?”</p><p>Hermione tapped her chin thoughtfully. “I need you to do me a favor. I know your primary focus is Advice or How-To, but I do think this could work along those lines. I need you to write an article about me. A kind of interview. I will have a chat with Editor-in-Chief Baumgartner, I’m sure he will let it swing.”</p><p>“Oh, how wonderful! But um… Has this anything to do with the article in Rumours this morning?”</p><p>Hermione’s eyes widened. “You know about it?”</p><p>Her friend looked sheepish. “Well, the interns have to read through all of the competitors every morning, the other London papers…and they’ve been keeping everyone current on what they’re writing about you. It’s absolutely awful, just complete rubbish. But... did you actually buy a house elf?”</p><p>Hermione ground her teeth in frustration. She could not believe how many people paid attention to those garbage gossip papers. It was infuriating. “Of course, I did, but <em> only </em> so that I could <em> free </em> her and <em> employ </em> her! What a disgraceful excuse for journalism. We have to fire back, Eulessia!”</p><p>Her friend gave her a wry smile. “I have to agree. I don’t think Baumgartner will mind us taking that farcical rag down. The only reason they’re propagating all of those lies about you is because<em> you’re </em> the columnist selling the <em> most </em> papers! They just want to discredit their competition and hurt our circulation.”</p><p>“Exactly!” exclaimed Hermione. “This has to be <em> stopped </em>. I’m not playing games anymore with this wretch of a writer, whoever they are.”</p><p>Eulessia smiled and winked. “That’s the ticket. Just let me know what you need, Hermione. I definitely won’t turn down the opportunity for a front-page feature.”</p><p>At that moment, a copywriter popped his head in and said, “Staff meeting in ten minutes. It’s very important.”</p><p>“Oh,” Hermione murmured. “I wonder what it could be about?”</p><p>Eulessia lowered her voice and leaned into Hermione. “<em> Apparently </em> , there’s been a breach at Azkaban prison. But the Ministry contacted Baumgartner and said it is <em>not</em> to be put into the papers. They don’t want the public to catch wind of it. It would cause too much fear. I mean, Azkaban has <em> never </em> been breached. Never!”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Tom Riddle levitated a muggle man through Knockturn Alley, secured by a Full Body Bind and a silencing curse. He threw a shoddy invisibility cloak over the man’s body until he approached the enchanted entrance that lay within a narrow corridor. For all appearances, it was nothing more than a dilapidated brick wall on the northern side of a shrunken head shop. However, this particular entrance had been a secret for decades. Tom glanced around the dark, misty side-street, which was almost entirely encased in a thick fog this particular morning, ensuring that he was indeed alone. For good measure, he cast <em> Homenum Revelio </em>, which confirmed that he was not being followed or watched.</p><p>Tom tapped a few bricks in specific succession, and suddenly the brick wall suddenly melted away into a large, arched doorway, nearly twenty feet high. The doorway actually led to a dark, murky tunnel, and Tom passed into the shadows, levitating his invisible prisoner alongside him.</p><p>There were large torches on either side of the tunnel, illuminating the enormous doors that lined the sides of the stone tunnel walls. When Riddle reached a black door, he muttered, “<em> Aberto </em>.” The door wasn’t locked and it opened with a creak, so he walked through. </p><p>He crossed the dimly lit, open space of the pub, which was now empty with it being so early in the morning. It would be packed with giants come evening. </p><p>“Maigog,” Riddle said aloud. He heard a loud, thunderous shuffling sound coming from the back. After a few moments, a colossal man emerged from a door behind the bar, his footsteps shaking the wood beneath Riddle’s feet.</p><p>“Ah,” the man grunted. “Tom Riddle. It’s been a fair few moons since you’ve set foot in my pub. What brings you here at this early hour?”</p><p>Riddle grinned. “I’ve been busy, my friend. I’ve brought you something.” Tom reached out and yanked the invisibility cloak from the floating body of the muggle.</p><p>Maigog’s eyes flared. “Where did you get that, eh? Brought us a present this morning, I see. To what do we owe this visit?”</p><p>Riddle glared at the muggle. “Call it a gesture of goodwill. I will be back here tonight. I’m bringing a… <em> friend </em>.”</p><p>The giant’s eyes narrowed. “A friend, eh? You’ve never brought a friend before.”</p><p>“You’ll like her.”</p><p>“Her? Ah. A lady friend.” The giant chuckled knowingly. “Better places ter bring a woman than a pub full o’ giants, Riddle. Haven’t you heard? The ladies like ter be wined and dined.”</p><p>This time, Tom chuckled. “She’s no ordinary woman, Maigog.”</p><p>“That right?”</p><p>“She likes to be <em> scared </em>,” Riddle grinned. “And I enjoy frightening her.”</p><p>“A’right bring yer weird friend, then.”</p><p>Riddle glanced back at the muggle. He removed the silencing charm, and the man immediately started pleading for his life. Tom glanced at Maigog. </p><p>“This man here is a muggle politician. He enjoys the little boys, don’t you, Terry?” He brushed the man’s sweat-slicked hair from his forehead. Then he leaned closer, looking the man in the eyes. “You see my very large friend over there? He enjoys eating people. He likes his meals still alive. He rips them limb from limb. Sometimes prefers them boiled alive. Other times just eats them raw. Then he'll use their bones for toothpicks. Maybe if you’re lucky, he’ll let you choose which way you’d like to be feasted on.”</p><p>The man immediately began screaming and thrashing against the Full Body Bind. Riddle grinned, then turned to go.</p><p>“See you tonight, Maigog!”</p><p>“A’right Riddle, see you tonight. Thanks fer the snack! I do love it when they struggle.”</p><p>Riddle turned and bowed low. “You are <em> most </em> welcome. Do me a favor and make it painful.”</p>

</p><p> </p><p>After getting home from work that evening, Hermione and Piksy rushed around the cottage in Godric’s Hollow, packing up the last few things which she would take to her flat in the morning.</p><p>Suddenly, a knock sounded at the door. </p><p>Hermione was instantly on alert. She’d received far too many death threats of late to not be suspicious. There were many wards on the home, but she supposed they weren’t designed to stop someone from knocking.</p><p>“Piksy! Will you look through the window and see who it is at the door?”</p><p>“Certainly, Mistress Hermione.” Although Hermione had instructed the elf to call her Hermione rather than Mistress Dumbledore, the elf still hadn’t been able to change her habits, so a compromise had been struck.</p><p>“It be a handsome young man, Mistress.”</p><p><em> Could it be Alphard Black? </em> Hermione wondered. “At least say “Miss” instead of “Mistress,” Piksy! It reminds me of a house elf named Kreacher who I’m not very fond of. Is his hair blonde or black?”</p><p>“It be black as night, Miss.”</p><p>Right. It had to be Alphard paying a visit. He had owled her saying he might stop by to see her later in the week, but it was a bit early all the same, and she had forgotten to tell him about her new flat.</p><p>Hermione ran to the door and whipped it open. “Hello, Alph-”</p><p>She stopped short. </p><p>It was none other than Tom Riddle standing in her doorway, and not Alphard Black.</p><p>“<em> Oh </em>,” she muttered, surprised. “Tom.”</p><p>His eyes were narrowed as he cocked his head to the side. “Expecting someone else?”</p><p>“<em> No </em> ,” she muttered defensively, swallowing. “I just wasn’t expecting <em> you </em>.”</p><p>“My apologies for surprising you. May I come in?”</p><p>Her eyes widened. “You <em>most</em> <em>certainly</em> may not.”</p><p>He laughed incredulously. “I must say, your manners are somewhat lacking. I suppose if you won’t let me in, then I’ll have to entice you to come out and play.” His eyes scanned her in appraisal, taking in her appearance. Hermione wore a very stylish black playsuit that buttoned up the front and belted around her waist. She had a monochrome floral scarf tied around her neck above her collar. Her arms and legs were tanned from her time spent in the garden most weekends. It was a very chic look for the period she was in, and she felt a bit like Grace Kelly in it.</p><p>Her cheeks reddened under his prolonged gaze. When his eyes rose to meet hers, he raised his eyebrows and inclined his head as if to say, <em> not bad. </em></p><p>Hermione pursed her lips and glared at him, willing her pulse to slow down. “Why are you here?”</p><p>He leaned closer, resting his forearm arm on the door frame. “Why don’t you come out and I’ll tell you?”</p><p>Hermione’s eyebrows drew forward sharply. “How do I know you won’t curse me as soon as I step foot out the door?”</p><p>“Am I a vampire, Hermione? Why do you act as if the threshold of this house will somehow keep me out if I mean you harm?”</p><p>She looked around, unsure of how to respond, because he did make a good point.</p><p>“Besides,” he continued in his smooth cadence, “If I wanted to curse you, I could do so from right here… and I probably already would’ve. By the way, your house elf is ogling me from the window.” </p><p>Hermione glanced over and saw a wide-eyed Piksy gazing curiously at Riddle through the window panes. Hermione bit back a smile.</p><p>Riddle continued, “Why do you suspect me of wanting to curse you? Have I shown any inclination or desire to hurt you?”</p><p>She could kick herself because he was right. She shouldn’t have any reason to believe him a violent person. “No… I don’t suppose so.”</p><p>His eyes narrowed. “Unless, of course, you think you know something about me.”</p><p>She narrowed her eyes in return. “What is there to know?”</p><p>He smiled politely, but it didn’t reach his eyes. “I don’t know, you tell me.”</p><p>“Perhaps it’s my intuition.”</p><p>He scoffed. “You seem to have no qualms about being alone with Malfoy or Black. <em> Neither </em> of them are saints, Hermione.”</p><p>She rolled her eyes. “Yes, but at least <em> Abraxas </em> is a gentleman, whereas you, sir, are a bit of a cad.”</p><p>His eyebrows raised in surprise. “Hermione… Malfoy is <em> no </em> gentleman. You have far more to fear from him than me, at least, in that respect.”</p><p>“That remains to be seen.”</p><p>Riddle held out his hand. “Come then, and I’ll show you.”</p><p>Hermione stared at his hand. “I- You can’t just come to a girl’s house with <em> no warning </em> at…” She glanced at her watch. “ <em> Eight o’clock </em> at night and whisk her away somewhere!”</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>“Well… I don’t <em> know </em>. It’s just… rude, I suppose.”</p><p>He cleared his throat. “What is rude is you keeping me standing out here for an alarmingly long time considering I did brave the <em> great </em> Albus Dumbledore’s <em> personal </em> residence just to take said girl out for a drink.”</p><p>Hermione sighed, looked at his outstretched hand, and then hesitantly stepped outside. “Where are you taking me?”</p><p>His lips turned up mischievously. “How brave <em> are </em> you?”</p><p>She feigned affront. “I’m a <em> Gryffindor </em>, Tom.”</p><p>“Are you brave enough to go somewhere potentially dangerous with me?” He grinned, dragging his tongue along his perfect teeth.</p><p>Her heart beat swiftly, but it had little to do with the threat of danger. </p><p>“That depends.”</p><p>This time, Tom feigned affront. “You don’t trust me?”</p><p>“Not at all.”’</p><p>He smirked and then leaned in close, gripped her wrist, and whispered, “That’s very smart of you. Let’s go.”</p><p>“Where are we going?”</p><p>“You’ll see.”  He apparated them immediately.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>They reappeared in Knockturn Alley, hidden in a shadowy little side street. There were all sorts of shady characters lurking about, most of which were unidentifiable or concealed beneath heavy cloaks and darkness. Hermione lifted her eyebrows dubiously, giving Riddle a scathing side-eye. “Knockturn Alley? You really know how to show a girl a good time.”</p><p>He chuckled. “Are you too posh for this, then?” He bent down and murmured into her sweet-smelling hair, “For some reason I had the impression that you’re not afraid to get your hands dirty. Was I wrong?”</p><p>She rolled her eyes, then turned aside to find him dangerously close. His scent overcame her, smelling of whiskey and smoke, cedarwood, and some oceanic aroma, like fresh rain. It went rushing to her brain and made her feel a bit cheeky. “I <em> can </em> get dirty when necessary, Riddle.”</p><p>His eyes narrowed, then fell to her lips and paused there as his tongue pressed into the side of his cheek. “Mmm. We’ll see.”</p><p>He led her down the narrow corridor to a wide brick wall. There was barely enough room for the two of them to stand. He reached into his pocket, producing a black piece of fabric which he lifted as if to blindfold her. She jerked back instinctually. </p><p>“It’s just the rules, Hermione. You’ll have to just trust me.”</p><p>She glared at Riddle. “That’s the issue. I <em> don’t </em> trust you.”</p><p>He sighed, bending down so that his eyes were level with hers, almost as if she were a child. “Have I ever given you a reason not to trust me?”</p><p><em> So many, I couldn’t even list them all </em>, she thought.</p><p>“I don’t wait for people to give me a reason not to trust them, Tom. I just naturally don’t trust <em> anyone </em>.”</p><p>He gazed back at her, his eyes soft and pensive. “We have that in common, then.” After a moment, he gently, slowly, brought the blindfold up and tied it around her eyes. “It’s just for a moment, Hermione.”</p><p>After he’d tapped each brick in succession, the wall melted away and the doorway appeared. He took her hand, noting how small it felt in his own, and led her into the dark tunnel. When they approached the large black door, he turned to her and untied the blindfold. </p><p>She looked around, her eyes adjusting to the darkness. She noted the size and height of the door and her brow furrowed. She felt a deep apprehension, but there was something delicious about it. Hermione certainly did not trust Riddle, but there was something dangerous and scintillating about placing her life in his hands. She loved the rush of adrenaline she’d felt when he placed the blind over her eyes, and the rough, but gentle touch of his hand, guiding her through the darkness.</p><p>Riddle waved his wand. She gazed at the bone-white yew wand in his hand, a little over thirteen inches long. She wondered errantly if his wand was at all a reflection of the length of his-</p><p>“Ready?” He glanced at her with a smile. The door cracked open.</p><p>She nodded, swallowing. He gently gripped her elbow, guiding her through the door alongside him. It was large enough to permit them both to walk through at once.</p><p>Hermione’s eyes widened and she stopped dead in her tracks. The room was enormous, and it was filled with <em> giants </em>.</p><p><em> Actual </em> giants.</p><p>Hermione and Tom were dwarfed by them, and by the size of the furniture, and the height of the bar, and the lights, and <em> everything </em> was simply <em> huge </em>. </p><p>“Holy cricket,” Hermione whispered. Riddle stood beside her, watching her out of the corner of his eye. </p><p>Hermione knew that after the first Wizarding War (in which the giants allied themselves with Voldemort) aurors had killed many of them and driven the rest of them into hiding. Then with the return of Voldemort, the remaining giants allied themselves with the Dark Lord once more. They’d fought them during the Battle of Hogwarts.</p><p>But of course, before the first Wizarding War, some giants <em> did </em> exist and mingle among wizardkind. </p><p>The sight was absolutely frightening to behold.</p><p>“Maigog!” Riddle called out. A large giant with black hair and a long beard came over from the bar.</p><p>“Ah, so you <em> have </em> come back. And this is… your <em> friend </em>?” The giant looked her up and down.</p><p>“Yes. This is Hermione. Hermione, meet Maigog. He is the owner of this pub.”</p><p>“Um, hello,” she said shyly, and then she reached out her hand because she didn’t know what <em> else </em> to do. He stared at her tiny hand and then tipped his head back, laughing uproariously. Then he bent down, squatting on his knees, and held out his forefinger, allowing her to shake it awkwardly. </p><p>Riddle fought back his laughter as well, but sobered quickly when Hermione shot him an angry glare. “Your manners are <em> impeccable </em> , Dumbledore. Unless, of course, it’s <em> me </em> standing at your front door.”</p><p>She whispered angrily under her breath as the giant led them into the pub. “You bring me to a pub full of giants in <em> Knockturn Alley </em> , no less, and then you proceed to <em> mock </em> me. You are on dangerous footing already, Mr. Riddle.”</p><p>At that, Tom did throw his head back and laughed deeply, and it was so attractive that Hermione felt her chest tighten uncomfortably. “Do you think I’m on some kind of quest for your favor, Hermione?”</p><p>“If you are, you’re terrible at it. Better find another dream quickly.”</p><p>He chuckled, and his hand came to rest on the small of her back casually as he guided her to a more private area clearly intended for humans.</p><p>Her lower back tingled at his touch.</p><p>She thought of the number of times Alphard Black had casually touched her on their outing. His contact had not seemed to affect her so viscerally as Tom’s.</p><p>Hermione observed the monstrous man named Maigog. He looked much more human than some of the giants she’d seen during the war. All of the giants in the pub did. He also spoke very clearly and intelligently. Something she’d always been told was that giants were unintelligent, bloodthirsty, murderous, suspicious, and easily riled. But these giants simply seemed like average people, although they did cast a variety of looks at her and Riddle as they passed, ranging from mere curiosity to thinly veiled disgust. </p><p>“Table for two,” Riddle said.</p><p>“Right here,” said Maigog. They climbed up a few steps to an area containing a few tables and booths. It was a darker corner, on a railed platform on one side of the pub. It afforded a very good view of the rest of the pub, but felt very private as well. The giant could reach the platform without taking the stairs, which were clearly only built for humans. There were no other wizards in the pub, although Hermione imagined there might be a trusted few that frequented the establishment. </p><p>So <em> this </em> was how Voldemort got the giants on his side during the wars.</p><p>The more she learned about him, the more he interested her.</p><p>They took a seat in a little booth in the far corner. Hermione gazed around her, observing her unobstructed view of this magnificent race of people. They were just so <em> large </em>. It was certainly a fearsome sight. They drank from huge mugs, some kind of dark beer.</p><p>After a moment, she turned back to Riddle. He sat gazing at her with unmasked intensity.</p><p>“Well,” she said, releasing a breath slowly. “You certainly don’t disappoint, do you?” </p><p>He smirked. “Has anyone ever told you that you look very pretty when you’re nervous?”</p><p>She rolled her eyes but felt warmth spread through her chest. “That’s a strange compliment. Is that a kink of yours?”</p><p>Riddle laughed. “It might be. Are you suddenly interested in my kinks?”</p><p>“Certainly not. Not <em> ever </em>,” she scowled.</p><p>He grinned broadly. “I’d be more than happy to familiarize you with them.”</p><p>“Is there a reason you’ve brought me here?”</p><p>“As a matter of fact,” he said seriously. “I’ve decided to stage an intervention.”</p><p>She blinked. “Excuse me?”</p><p>He leaned back, resting his arm along the back of the booth. “Well, to start with, you’ve been attending quite a few balls and quidditch matches with the premier <em> pureblooded </em> bachelors of London. Then I see you’ve broken down and bought yourself a house elf. What kind of person would I be if I let you carelessly toss aside your own ideals in such a frivolous manner?”</p><p>She shook her head. “You’ve <em> got </em> to be kidding me.”</p><p>“It’s quite scandalous<em> . </em>”</p><p>Hermione set her jaw. “You’re insufferable. Do you actually read those trashy gossip tabloids?”</p><p>He smirked  “I see them on the stands. Your name seems to sell quite a lot them. No wonder they keep terrorizing you.”</p><p>“It’s disgusting.”</p><p>“Did you <em> enjoy </em> yourself?”</p><p>She huffed. “What do you mean?”</p><p>“At the quidditch match.”</p><p>She glared at him. “I had an <em> exceedingly </em> lovely time.”</p><p>“You don’t strike me as the quidditch type.”</p><p>“No? What <em> type </em> do I strike you as, then?”</p><p>He smirked. “The type that rides dragons, duels dark wizards, and breaks into banks, of course.” He inclined his head. “And visits pubs full of giants with <em> seedy </em> men.”</p><p>Despite herself, Hermione fought back a smile. He was right, of course. She was definitely <em> not </em> interested in quidditch. Nor balls, for that matter.</p><p>She gazed across the table in the dim light of the pub. “So. You’re friendly with giants?”</p><p>He nodded. “I am.”</p><p>“Curious.”</p><p>Riddle cocked his head. “Why is that curious?”</p><p>“You’re friends with Slytherins and purebloods. It seems like they would harbor quite a bit of disdain for giants. I’m surprised you don’t think them beneath you. Besides, I thought giants <em> hated </em> wizards.”</p><p>Tom considered her words. “My <em> Slytherin </em> friends do not know about the majority of my associations. Truthfully, you’re the only person I’ve brought here. And it's true. Giants don’t have the best history with wizards <em> or </em> muggles. They are allowed to roam, with restriction, in our society, but they are unhappy with their lot. Very misunderstood creatures.”</p><p>Hermione recalled Hagrid saying the same thing. It was strange to hear it from Riddle’s mouth, almost as if he had compassion for them, which she knew him to be incapable of.</p><p>“They are more widely accepted in America. New York City, especially. There is a muggle sports team called the New York Giants, for example. There’s a reason for that. The giants are everywhere among the magical society in New York.” He smiled wryly. “They are more restricted and policed here in Britain. They have much more to gain if the statute were to fall, so they do keep certain allegiances.”</p><p>Hermione’s interest was piqued. “Do you foresee that ever happening?”</p><p>His eyes flicked to hers, now marbled with glowing crimson. “It <em> will </em> happen. One day.”</p><p>He didn’t seem to want to elaborate further on that, so Hermione left the topic alone for the time being. “How did you become friends with them? I’m sure you gained favor with them somehow.”</p><p>He smirked. “I have my methods.”</p><p>Her brow furrowed. “What are they?”</p><p>He leaned forward, his eyes narrowed. “Considering your recent appointment as Ambassador of Muggle Relations, I think it best if we left it ambiguous.”</p><p>She bit her lip, suddenly anxious. “No, <em> tell </em> me.”</p><p>He laughed under his breath. “I feed them muggles.”</p><p>Hermione looked at him in horror, mouth agape. “You <em> what </em>?”</p><p>He grinned, clearly finding her shock hilarious. “Only the <em> bad </em> ones, of course.” He winked.</p><p>Hermione's eyes were wild, her face both appalled and disgusted. </p><p>“Does that shock you, Hermione?”</p><p>Hermione sputtered. “A <em> bit! </em>”</p><p>He chuckled. “Going to turn me into the Ministry? Send me packing to Azkaban?”</p><p>She sighed, looking at him very severely. “I really <em> should </em>. It would be what you deserve.”</p><p>He tilted his head, observing her. “And what about what they deserve?”</p><p>“Who?”</p><p>“The blasted git I brought to Maigog earlier today, for example.”</p><p>“You- you… <em> Today </em>?”</p><p>He glanced about the room, then met her incredulous stare. His expression was unreadable. “The man was a muggle politician. A very corrupt one.”</p><p>“Are you claiming to have only ever killed <em> corrupt </em> people?”</p><p>He took a cigarette out of a case from his cloak and shoved it between his lips. As he struck a match and lit the end, inhaling snappishly, he muttered, “I never said that.”</p><p>“Wonderful,” she muttered derisively. She continued to watch him in disbelief. “How do you <em> know </em> the man was corrupt?”</p><p>Smoke billowed from his mouth and nostrils. “I was astral projecting one evening. Sending my soul out of my body. I happened to find myself in a muggle dinner party, full of politicians. But I overheard a few things that were quite obscene, even for me.”</p><p>“You can… project your soul into… <em> other </em> people’s homes?” Her face was horrified.</p><p>He smirked, observing the slight pink color tinting her cheeks. “Some. Most wizarding homes and buildings have protective enchantments and wards. Older wizarding buildings have protective runes set into their foundation stones.” He glanced at her. “The intent is to keep the ghosts out. But in addition, keep souls from projecting themselves in.” </p><p>The scholarly side of Hermione was intrigued. “How fascinating. I’ve read some about the astral arts but… there isn’t really much material about it in the libraries.”</p><p>“It’s a dark art, Hermione. You wouldn’t have read about it in many places. It’s also quite dangerous.”</p><p>“So…” Hermione gazed at him searchingly. “What things did you hear? What could possibly be so obscene that the man deserved to die?”</p><p>Before Riddle could answer, a giant approached, holding a tray bearing two tiny mugs. They weren’t actually tiny, they were the perfect size for humans, but they seemed minuscule in comparison with the giant. Riddle handed her one of the mugs, brimming with a fizzing, foaming dark brown liquid. “Try it.”</p><p>She looked at it warily. “What is it?”</p><p>He chuckled. “It’s called <em>Nephiliquor</em>. Otherwise known as Giant’s ale.”</p><p>Hermione looked at it doubtfully, but gripped the handle and took a sip. She made a pained face. “It’s quite <em> strong… </em> but it <em> is </em> good. Very good, actually.”</p><p>His eyebrows lifted. “I confess myself surprised. I assumed you’d be too spoiled on champagne to enjoy the barbaric drink of <em> brutish </em> giants.”</p><p>“I’m going to ignore your presuppositions.” She took another sip, glancing around the pub. “These giants are very different. From everything I’ve heard about giants… well, these seem so much more <em> human </em>.”</p><p>Riddle nodded. “There are different races of giants. Some are as different as muggles from wizards, or goblins from house elves. These are descendants of the Rephaim, and they are much closer in stature and mind to humans than others of their kind.”</p><p>“I see.” Hermione glanced about, taking in the appearance of the pub. Red lanterns hung from the ceiling, and very forlorn piano music drifted throughout, played by a female giant on the floor below. The interior of the pub was actually quite beautiful. Truly it was more like a private club than a pub. She found it strange that the place could be so melancholy and atmospheric, and be owned by a race that quite literally, <em> ate </em> people.</p><p>Every time she encountered the man Tom Riddle, he surprised her.</p><p>“To answer your question… the muggle man was very wealthy and influential, and he gave a lot of money to charities. One of them was an orphanage.” He brought the cigarette to his lips and he inhaled. On his exhale, he continued through the ejection of smoke. “Anyway, he had a kind of arrangement with the matron. He felt since he gave large sums of money that kept the orphanage operating, he was <em> entitled </em> to the children there. I overheard him offering to share the children with another influential friend of his. I’ll let you take a guess at what they did with them.” Riddle’s jaw muscles tensed, but he didn’t look at Hermione as he lifted his mug and took a long draught of ale.</p><p>Hermione was very still. She didn’t question what he meant by that statement, as it was clearly implied by the contempt in Riddle’s voice. It made her feel sick, and she suddenly wondered if it was the same orphanage that Riddle himself grew up in.</p><p>Hermione decided that she would go and visit that orphanage. She had to see where he’d come from. How terrible that one would never have memories of a beautiful childhood… of one’s parents, of outings, of love and happiness.</p><p>She found it strange that he would feel protective of the children there when he had allegedly frightened two children almost to death as a child.</p><p>But perhaps the matron who had said such things was no saint, after all. Perhaps Riddle had only been protecting himself. There was no way of knowing.</p><p>“What orphanage?” Hermione asked softly.</p><p>He shrugged. “Doesn’t matter, really. What <em> does </em> matter is that Maigog and Daikeris over there,” he pointed to his friend and another giant behind the bar. “They ate him.” He laughed under his breath.</p><p>Tom’s bitterness was palpable.</p><p>She watched him take another drag from his cigarette. “Where did you learn astral projection?”</p><p>He expelled smoke. “I taught myself. Quite a bit of trial and error.”</p><p>“That’s quite remarkable. How ever do you have the time to learn these kinds of magic?”</p><p>He smiled dryly. “I don’t sleep.”</p><p>That, she could believe. As handsome as he was, he was looking a bit peaky lately. He was paler than normal, with barely perceptible dark circles under his eyes.</p><p>“What kinds of things do you study?”</p><p>He flicked his eyes up at her. “Things that would corrupt the garden of my <em> soul </em>, Hermione.”</p><p>She sighed. He was often referring to her articles with scorn. Perhaps he thought she judged him harshly. “Do you wake early to study?”</p><p>He nodded once. “I do.”</p><p>“So do I.”</p><p>Smoke poured from his mouth. “What kinds of things do <em> you </em> study?”</p><p>She exhaled. “Well, of late, the progression of magical creatures’ protection laws. Past lives. Ichthyomancy. Protection circles. The floating eye curse. Star-gazing and astrology. Sacrificial protection. Tarot… Just to name a few.”</p><p>He gazed at her for several moments. “I enjoyed your article on past lives.”</p><p>“Did you?”</p><p>He nodded. “Very intriguing research. You know, I’ve yet to see your <em> magic </em> in action. I’m curious about a witch who singly-handedly took down a dark wizard.”</p><p>“Oh, I never said I did it single-handedly. I had two friends to help.”</p><p>He stared at her blankly. “So you were serious?”</p><p>She looked at him with surprise. “Of <em> course </em>.”</p><p>His eyes narrowed. “Who was the wizard?”</p><p>Her lips turned up in a hint of a smile. “Oh, he was very ugly. Dark arts will do that, you know. Make you ugly. He was bald, with very dry skin… he had slits for eyes and no nose <em> at all </em> . His fingernails were yellow and he was spindly and wraith-like. I imagine he might’ve been handsome once, but alas. I suppose the <em> garden </em> of his <em> soul </em> was far too corrupted.”</p><p>Tom said nothing but gazed at Hermione. The soft piano music drifted mournfully through the pub.</p><p>They were silent for a bit as they sipped their ale. The giant brought another round of drinks and Hermione felt her chest and skin growing warm from the bitterly strong alcohol. Everything began to seem a bit fuzzy. She looked at Riddle and asked something that she had wondered about for months. “Do you actually believe all this pureblood nonsense?”</p><p>His black eyes were piercing and sharp when they turned on her. “I’m a <em> half-blood </em>, Hermione. Do you think I believe in it?”</p><p>She returned his gaze boldly. “Then why do you cater to them?”</p><p>The energy between them crackled, teeming with the force of their magic mingling. “I do what I have to do. You’d be wise to do the same if what you seek is power. I have a feeling that it is.”</p><p>“I seek only to incur change, Tom.”</p><p>“As do I.”</p><p>She gave an amused ‘<em> hmph </em>.’ “I think you’re going about it entirely the wrong way.”</p><p>He smiled mockingly. “Funny, I’ve thought the same thing about you and your methods.”</p><p>Hermione’s chin lifted a notch. “I suppose we’ll see then, won’t we?”</p><p>Riddle’s dark eyes glittered like multi-faceted onyx and he held up his mug. “Cheers to that.”</p><p>They drank in silence, eyes locked.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>When Tom apparated them back to Godric’s Hollow, they took a walk along the main street, passing by an old church, the sewing shop, an ice cream parlor, and the graveyard. They were passing by the exact spot where she and Harry had seen Bathilda Bagshot, which was actually Voldemort’s serpent, Nagini.</p><p>“I enjoyed the pub.”</p><p>He glanced at her. “Did you?”</p><p>She nodded, meeting his stare. “Yes, I did. Although I’m a bit tipsy. I suspect if you ever wanted to get me sufficiently <em> sloshed </em>, Giant’s ale would be the way to go.”</p><p>He held back a smile. “Are you a happy drunk or an angry one?”</p><p>“Oh, <em> happy </em>, certainly. I get very talkative, studious, and extremely active. I’ll clean your entire flat and cook you dinner, all whilst regaling you about mermaid social hierarchies and the dangers of hinkypunks.”</p><p>Tom laughed against his will. “Are you inviting yourself to my flat for dinner and drinks, then?”</p><p>Her face reddened. “Of course not.”</p><p>“Ah, but you just offered to clean my flat and cook for me, and I’m terribly ignorant of mermaids, as it stands.”</p><p>Hermione cleared her throat and kept walking, but her face and neck felt very hot. She thought it best to change the subject. “You asked me this once, Tom, but… do you believe in past lives?”</p><p>He thought for a minute. “I would rather believe in that than the notion that there’s something after this life… some kind of judgment or great tallying of all our sins and deeds.”</p><p>“Hmm.” She was quiet as they walked. “It's a romantic concept, I suppose.”</p><p>“Are you a romantic, Hermione?”</p><p>“No,” she muttered definitively. “I don’t think I am.”</p><p>“Neither am I.”</p><p>“So you don’t believe in an afterlife?”</p><p>“I don’t relish the thought of the unknown. I cannot control what I do not know, Hermione. I want to own something. In this life. Something I built with my own two hands… and I want to keep it. I desire that <em> this </em> would be… all there is.”</p><p>Hermione thought that his hopes were desperately sad.</p><p>He was telling her, in his own way, that he feared the repercussions of his pursuit of power.</p><p>He wanted all his darkness and death to amount to nothing.</p><p>The lives he took, were nothing more than transient matter.</p><p>All he could hope for was the emptiness of immortality.</p><p>To reign forever over a kingdom of death and destruction, a few slivers of humanity tethering him to this world, with the dark forces to keep his macabre carcass from rotting.</p><p>What would he think if she told him what he would one day become?</p><p>She met his eyes and sparks flew. She could feel his magic around her like shadows licking against her skin. She shivered with the pressing of it, but the prickles had little to do with her fear of him, and more to do with her <em> desire </em> for him. </p><p>“How final,” she murmured softly. </p><p>“Precisely,” he whispered, his eyes watching her closely. “You mentioned stargazing. Are you at all skilled in divination?”</p><p>“If I were, I wouldn’t be studying it so voraciously. I would say there’s a rather large gap in my education where divination is concerned. I’ve always held the practice in contempt.”</p><p>They stopped walking in front of the cottage, and he tipped his head back to look up at the stars. “I find divination to be the most frightening branch of magic.”</p><p>Her eyebrows shot up. “Even more so than the dark arts?”</p><p>He glanced at her. “Absolutely.”</p><p>Riddle held out his hand and suddenly, to Hermione’s amazement, the night sky appeared in his hand. She gazed at the universe and its milky clusters of stars and its planets in orbit. It was so beautiful as it floated above his hand that she reached out to try and touch it. She waved her fingers through the stars, dragging the little wisps of shadow, like tendrils of night curling around her fingertips.</p><p>“How beautiful,” she whispered softly. She looked at him and the stars were reflected in his obsidian eyes. “How are you doing that?”</p><p>“Intuitively,” he muttered. </p><p>“What do you mean?” she asked, staring at the miniature universe in his palm.</p><p>“In schools, they’ll only teach you tried and true methods. Formulas. Spells. Incantations. Magic that has already been imagined and created. What they won’t tell you is that magic is intuitive. Wizards possess the ability to sense magical energy and harness it through the power of the mind. Those spells and incantations didn’t even exist at one time. They had to be imagined, created, and harnessed. Willed into being by a powerful witch or wizard.”</p><p>“Why don’t they teach this?”</p><p>“Because if they did, there would be some witches and wizards who would become much too powerful. There are no limits on the amount of power one could wield if such principles were put to the correct use.”</p><p>

</p><p> </p><p>“Fascinating.” Hermione continued to wiggle her fingers through the stars, captivated by their strange substance. Of a sudden, the sky disappeared and Tom took hold of Hermione’s hand.</p><p>She stared at their hands, now clasped together. He began to run his fingertips softly along her skin. His hand was warm, and she noted that it dwarfed her much smaller one, with long, pale fingers and prominent veins that extended up his wrist, disappearing beneath the cuff of his shirt. Her heart began to thud rapidly in her chest.</p><p>She slowly lifted her eyes to peer up at Riddle. Had he been so <em> tall </em> before? His eyes were narrowed as he gazed back at her, gauging her reaction as if she were a skittish animal.</p><p>He used her hand to gently pull her closer, until she could feel the heat from his body radiating around her own. Hermione stopped breathing.</p><p>Tom released her hand and then laid his at the base of her throat, letting it rest there with his thumb against her pulse. It pumped furiously against the pad of his finger.</p><p>His eyes met hers.</p><p>“Tom,” Hermione whispered.</p><p>Riddle did not hesitate. He leaned down and covered her mouth with his.</p><p>Hermione was surprised by how quickly her own body reacted to his; she melted beneath his touch.</p><p>The kiss was gentle at first as if he were giving her a moment to acclimate herself, but his lips quickly grew hard and insistent, sending flames licking upward through her body. His hand moved from her throat to her hair, threading into her curls and gripping them tightly, causing her scalp to burn, though not unpleasantly. His tongue slid against the seam of her lips, parting them and invading her mouth boldly. He tasted inexplicable, like spearmint, expensive whiskey, and tobacco. She bit back a moan.</p><p>His tongue moved against hers, forcefully advancing into her mouth only to retreat and then slide back in with a smoothness that made her head spin. She felt his teeth tug her bottom lip before his mouth slanted across hers, deepening the kiss as if he intended to devour her. </p><p>It was no soft first kiss. It was the snapping of a cord pulled tight.</p><p>He tasted like hunger and darkness and longing. So much <em> longing </em> and <em> loneliness </em>, like the ache of an unhealed wound.</p><p>She wanted to respond with her own brand of heat... as if she could <em> heal </em> him with only her body and her skin. In the furthest part of her mind, she knew that she was kissing Lord Voldemort... but the Giant's ale was strong in her system and the building of tension between them these past weeks made it so deliciously <em>easy </em>to give in.</p><p>Tom was everywhere, searching, plumbing her depths with his power. His right hand tightened in her hair, not permitting her to pull away when the heat between them morphed into a flame. His left hand sought her skin, but the playsuit proved to be a barrier, so he searched out the skin of her legs, dragging his fingertips slowly along the back of her thigh, inching slowly upward.</p><p>But<em>, Merlin</em>, this man could kiss.</p><p>Warmth pooled in the pit of her stomach, spreading in waves through her core. Her pulse was racing, and before she was aware of what she was doing, she released a soft sound, the barest hint of a moan, a whimper that fell like a breath.</p><p>At that, Riddle paused. His muscles went rigid against her softer body, and he broke the kiss to lean back and look at Hermione.</p><p>His eyes searched her face, taking in her flushed cheeks and her now red and slightly swollen lips. Then his eyes met hers, enthralling her with quiet intensity. They were like two portals, black holes in the midst of space that contained universes. She wanted to become lost in them, as if she could somehow escape the reality of who he would become and how he would eventually almost destroy her life.</p><p>She wondered then if there was more to him than the evil he would become. Were there alternate realities? Was there a possibility that in some alternate universe, with an entirely different set of circumstances, Riddle could have been a good person?</p><p>His hand still rested on the back of her thigh, and it scalded her. As they stood gazing at one another, she imagined what his touch would feel like in other, more intimate places. In some distant place in her mind, she realized the thought was incredibly traitorous and wrong, but she couldn’t seem to pull herself out of the bubble they were in.</p><p>She felt locked in a trance.</p><p>Riddle brushed her bottom lip with his thumb, and she knew he was contemplating kissing her again.</p><p>Suddenly, Hermione began to feel a sensation around her ankle. At first, she thought it was some kind of strange magic belonging to Tom, but as she focused on the feeling, she realized that something was wrapping around her leg. She abruptly pulled away from Riddle and looked down, then immediately let out a scream.</p><p>A black snake was curling itself around her ankle and slithering up her leg. She jumped back as if to shake it off but immediately Riddle knelt down and began to hiss softly. As soon as he spoke, the snake unwound itself from her ankle and began to slide toward him through the grass. </p><p>Her heart was beating extremely fast, her veins full of adrenaline. “The snake, it’s- It’s from the envelope.”</p><p>He looked up at her with furrowed brows. “What envelope?”</p><p>She took a deep breath and realized she was shaking, and not just because of the snake. “I’ve been getting some very <em> interesting </em> post lately.”</p><p>His eyes narrowed as the serpent slithered into his hand. “What post, <em> Hermione </em>?”</p><p>She swallowed, hesitating as she read the quiet hostility in his voice. “Just… some death threats, from angry goblins. Howlers from the purebloods. And- and I don’t <em> know </em> who sent the snake. I think its charmed to find me and poison me.”</p><p>Riddle’s eyes narrowed even more, and he looked at the snake in his hand before promptly turning it to black dust. The dust blew from his hand in the breeze as he turned to Hermione. “Why didn’t you tell me about all of this?”</p><p>“Excuse me? Why would I tell <em> you </em>?”</p><p>He stood staring at her, his face blank aside from the tensing of his jaw and a black and stormy rage building in his eyes. “You have to stop writing these articles, Hermione.”</p><p>Her mouth fell open. “I most certainly will not! I will not be intimidated!”</p><p>His jaw ticked, and his gaze was hard as stone.</p><p>She stared at him in utter shock. “<em>Of course</em>, that’s what you’d want me to do. Everything I write goes against your <em>pureblood friends</em> and their precious <em>traditions</em>. Is that what this has all been about? You’re trying to get me to stop writing my articles?”</p><p>He sighed. “Of course, I would like you to stop writing them. But what I want is of very little consequence. What is of consequence, is that you’re drawing a target on your back and putting yourself in danger.”</p><p>“Why do you care?”</p><p>He glared at her. “Are you always this bloody difficult?”</p><p>“I won't stop writing. I don’t care what you want or what you think.”</p><p>“If you don’t, this isn’t going to stop. You have no idea what the purebloods are like. I do.”</p><p>She narrowed her eyes and stepped forward angrily, bringing herself up to his chest. “I know <em> exactly </em> what they’re like. <em> Trust </em> me.”</p><p>Tom’s nostrils flared as he gazed at her. </p><p>“You can't tell me what to do, Tom. I won't be intimidated. Not by you, not by howlers, or snakes, or <em> Slytherins</em>, or anyone else.”</p><p>The energy that sparked between them had turned dark. It circled around them, pushing and pulling and weaving about like a treacherous storm. He looked down at her, his expression hard and laced with both fury and lust. Tom released a short breath through his nose. “I can’t decide whether I want to fuck you or <em>curse </em>you. You’re an irritating witch, Hermione.”</p><p>She stared back at him defiantly. “You’ll never get the chance to do either.”</p><p>He smirked poisonously. “If you won’t stop writing these articles, then I <em> will </em>find a way to stop you. And you will not like it.”</p><p>She narrowed her eyes coldly, anger seething from every pore in her body. “I invite you to try.”</p><p>He nodded. “Very well. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.”</p><p>Tom apparated with a click, leaving Hermione standing in front of the cottage, feeling a mixture of rage, defiance, desire, and perhaps most of all, disconsolate confusion.</p>

</p><p> </p><p><br/>Tom awoke on Tuesday morning, and the first thought that rose to his consciousness was of Hermione’s skin. Her soft, smooth, tanned skin beneath his fingertips, and the scent of lavender and vanilla, and something else that was very distinctly <em> Hermione </em>which drove his senses crazy.</p><p>The memory of her taste, her lips, her <em> tongue </em>in his mouth flooded back and shot straight to his cock. He leaned his head back with a groan, silently cursing her.</p><p>Tom reached for his cock and found that it was hard and erect. He released an irritated breath through his nose. He wouldn’t be reading this morning. If he didn’t satisfy this fucking <em> ache </em> in his body, he would be on edge all day.</p><p>He wrapped his fingers around his cock and began to stroke himself gently. He thought of her sweet-smelling hair wrapped tightly around his fingers, her pulse jumping wildly in her throat… the way she’d said his name, so soft and uncertain. She had been <em> afraid </em> he would kiss her.</p><p>Then, the moment that he had, she melted like candle wax. </p><p>His cock throbbed painfully. Following that train of thought, Tom imagined himself dripping hot candlewax all over her body, imagining the sound of her surprised gasp when the hot liquid connected with her skin.</p><p>Tom pumped himself faster, gritting his teeth as he thought about how fucking irritated he’d been with her at the end of the night. But that <em> sound </em> she’d made… that little whimper… or was it a moan?</p><p>Tom had stopped himself at that point. If he hadn’t, he might have pushed things too far. </p><p>Now wasn’t the time for that… <em> yet </em>.</p><p>He thought of her soft hand in his; he imagined her hand on his cock, stroking him gently. He thought of her stretched out in his bed, naked, all smooth skin and slender curves and wild hair. He thought of his hand around her throat. Tom wanted to control the very <em> air she breathed </em> . He wanted to leave bruises on her neck like a necklace she could wear to work. He wanted complete control over her, mind, body and soul. He wanted to own her, like he owned one of his horcruxes… simply because he knew she was a woman who could <em> never </em> be owned.</p><p>In fact, he desired to <em> make </em> her a horcrux. Then, he would always be inside of her, fully possessing her.</p><p>Tom didn’t know why he thought of her this way. It surprised him that he should desire her to such an acute degree. He knew his mind was acting up again, but he allowed it, because the thought of attaching a piece of his soul to Hermione <em> turned him on </em>.</p><p>He imagined the taste of her cunt. </p><p><em> Soon, </em> he reminded himself. </p><p>He imagined Hermione beneath him… sliding himself inside of her. What face would she make when she came? He intended to find out.</p><p>He heard her soft, breathy moan again. </p><p>He wanted her tears.</p><p>He wanted her <em> screams </em>.</p><p>Cum shot all over his stomach.</p><p>Tom ran a hand over his face, then threw his arm over his eyes.</p><p>He wasn’t very surprised that the night had ended as it had. Theirs would be no simple coming together. He had known this since the night of the Ostara ball.</p><p>That was the night he’d decided that he wanted her.</p><p>Riddle could recognize that something in Hermione was his exact contrast.</p><p>The yang to his yin.</p><p>An opposite, but interconnected force.</p><p>He recognized that anything they built together would be founded upon violence and conflict.</p><p>Tom was vaguely aware that all great things in this earth were the result of tension. Electricity, a force fed on resistance... Diamonds, a gem formed under intense pressure. </p><p>Tom and Hermione would become a <em> potent </em> thing. A power of immense magnitude. He knew this. He could sense it in the force of their magic when they were together.</p><p>Her magic sang for his.</p><p>It was like the crackling of electricity in the midst of a storm. Protons and electrons clashing and dancing in cohesion.</p><p>The attraction was so intense that he wondered if he had ever known her in a past life. Tom had learned to accept that nothing was impossible.</p><p>It was a mantra that he lived by, and it had served him well thus far.</p><p>He could discern that she possessed formidable magical potential. He wasn’t entirely sure if she was yet able to wield it properly, but that was a nonissue. He could teach her.</p><p>Tom <em> wanted </em> her. </p><p>His desire was a visceral thing. Like pain. Like the first time he’d read about horcruxes, he'd become so obsessed that he’d vomited out by the Black Lake. When he wanted things badly enough, he made himself sick.</p><p>Tom felt nausea rising up now, but he knew that it was because of the Giant’s ale. It caused terrible hangovers, and Tom truthfully couldn’t remember the last time he’d eaten. He’d pick up a scone on the way to work.</p><p>He yanked off his boxers and wiped the cum off his stomach, then got up out of bed and walked, naked, to the bathroom. He brushed his teeth as he thought about Hermione. He wanted to know what she was like in the morning; if she drank tea or coffee, if she was cheery or grumpy. She seemed like the type who wouldn’t fucking shut up in the morning.</p><p>Tom knew she would be angry with him this morning. Probably cursing his name and thinking up some new article she hoped would piss him off. He liked her pettiness. She had a little vindictive streak that he found charming.</p><p>He could also be vindictive, and he would enjoy wrangling her defiant side into submission.</p><p>Tom threw on a black robe and made his way to the kitchen where he brewed coffee. He pulled a book from of his bookshelf and removed the paper he always used as a bookmark. He had been studying the powers of invisibility and possession, which were extremely difficult if not defunct bits of magic, but Tom had discovered some interesting theories in <em> Dead Dark Arts </em> by Finnick Friedsson.</p><p>Tom suddenly recalled something that Hermione had said last night.</p><p><em> Sacrificial protection </em>.</p><p>His brow drew forward sharply; this was something he had not heard of, but it sounded vaguely familiar as if he might have come across it while reading once.</p><p>He made a mental note to study it further and continued with his current line of study.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Later that morning, Tom was dressed in a crisp, tailored white shirt and black slacks, along with his work robes bearing the Borgin &amp; Burkes badge pinned to his chest. He slid his Gaunt ring onto his right index finger and apparated to Diagon Alley.</p><p>He stopped at the newsstand and picked up the morning issue of <em> The Daily Prophet </em> . He gazed at the headline on the front page. A moving photograph of Hermione with her new house elf was splayed across the front page.<br/><br/><b> <em>DUMBLEDORE SPARKS MOVEMENT!</em> </b></p><p>
<em> House-Elf Employment at an All-Time High </em>
</p><p>
<em> Wizarding families everywhere are now boosting the morale of their personal staff by freeing and employing their family house elves. Hermione Dumbledore has paved the way for the humane treatment of these remarkable creatures by freeing and employing her own house-elf, Piksy. Piksy now acts as a personal assistant to Miss Dumbledore and earns a yearly salary, is given specified days off each week, and is provided with work uniforms, magical dental care, and lodging.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> This may come as a surprise to the wizarding community at large, following a disparaging article written about Miss Dumbledore in Rumours!, a London tabloid paper with crude print work, third-rate writing, and even shoddier reporting. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “They don’t even bother to corroborate their claims or even use reputable sources,” Hermione says with an amused smile and a dismissive shake of her head. “I really do marvel that anyone reads it! Not a single thing the paper writes is true. It’s, unfortunately, a slap in the face to true journalists everywhere.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> Daily Prophet columnist Eulessia Baron interviews Hermione Dumbledore in an exclusive piece about house elves, the cost of freedom, and the revolutionary direction of the wizarding community as a whole. Read more of this heart-warming story on page 17 </em>
</p><p>Tom couldn’t help a pleased grin from spreading across his face. </p><p>
<em> Good for you, Hermione. Bite back with those little teeth of yours. </em>
</p><p>Tom’s shoes clicked briskly on the cobblestone walkway as he crossed the street and made his way down Knockturn Alley to Borgin &amp; Burkes. A skeletal crow squawked from the windowsill, as it always did when someone opened the door.</p><p>“Ah, Good Morning, Tom!” shouted Caractarus Burke from the back of the shop. Tom crossed to the back room and noticed an assortment of new items being prepared for inventory. Notable among them were several items of goblin-wrought silver, including silverware, goblets, a pair of gauntlets, a helmet, and a silver ring set with a faceted ruby.</p><p>“What’s this?” Tom probed.</p><p>Burke shook his head. “After all this clamor about Gringotts and the goblins cursing the gold, we’ve had a slew of customers selling their goblin-wrought silver, fearing that it’s also cursed.” He gave a sinister smile. “I got them for a steal. They practically gave it all away. Just wait til all this ruckus dies down. Goblin-made silver will increase in value again, and I’ll make a <em> pretty </em> profit on all of this.”</p><p>Tom chuckled internally at the man’s prevailing greed. There was nothing Burke loved more than gold and galleons. “You should put a sign out front, advertising your rates on ‘cursed’ goblin-wrought silver. It might put the thought in the minds of passersby.”</p><p>Burke’s eyes bugged out. “Tom, you’re absolutely brilliant. Clever as a whip. Why didn’t I think of that?” The man immediately took off to do as he suggested.</p><p>Tom rolled his eyes and began to polish the silver with a charm. After a few minutes, he heard the sound of the front door opening, so he made his way out to the floor to aid any potential customers.</p><p>He saw the father of one of his Death Eaters. Edwin Rosier browsed the shop, eyeing a few items with curiosity. </p><p>“Mr. Rosier,” Tom greeted politely. “Good morning, sir.”</p><p>“Ah, Tom! Just the man I wanted to see. I hoped you were working this morning. How are you, my boy?”</p><p>Tom smiled congenially, but as usual, it didn’t reach his eyes. “Doing well this morning, sir. What brings you in?”</p><p>The older man had slick silver hair and a speckled salt-and-pepper beard. He was quite distinguished in appearance, with sharp velvet dress robes with silver clasps, a silver cane, and an emerald tie. “Nice ring you’ve got there, son. That a family heirloom?”</p><p>Tom's hand automatically rose to touch the ring. “It is, sir.”</p><p>Rosier nodded his head approvingly. “The Gaunts. Great line of wizards. Powerful line. <em> Strong </em> magical blood.”</p><p>Tom inclined his head in agreement. He knew there was an ulterior reason for Rosier’s visit.</p><p>“Anyway, Tom. I was just passing by, happened to be in Diagon Alley, and figured I’d pay you a visit. You know, my friends at the ministry still ask about you. ‘Whatever happened to that clever boy Riddle? Wasn’t he Head Boy?’” Edwin Rosier chuckled. “They’re all chomping at the bit to have you at the Ministry, Tom. I imagine there’d be several departments that would all fight over you were you to express interest.” He leaned over to Tom and murmured intimately, “Get you out of this hovel, eh?”</p><p>Tom smiled coldly. “I do appreciate the offer, sir. That’s very generous of you. I will keep it in mind for the future. However, I’m quite content where I am, at the moment.”</p><p>Rosier stared at Riddle for a moment. The older gentleman didn’t quite comprehend the hold that this young man had over his son. He didn’t understand much about the boy, truth be told. He had an eerie feeling about him; he couldn’t grasp the boy’s true intentions or motivations. That made him nervous. He thought if perhaps he could get the boy a job at the Ministry, he’d have him under his thumb and could keep an eye on him. But working here in a shady wares shop, reputed for its connectedness to the dark arts? It didn’t sit right with him. His son had grown quiet and secretive. He’d caught wind of his son’s prodigious skill in dueling and dark curses. It wasn’t that Mr. Rosier didn’t applaud magical skill, and he wasn’t entirely averse to the dark arts. But it was Riddle himself that didn’t sit well with Edwin Rosier.</p><p>“Of course, Tom. I’m aware you’re doing well for yourself here. Just something to think about… you know, for the future.” He smiled wryly and then began to make his way back out to the street.</p><p>“Oh, and Mr. Rosier,” Tom began. “If you have any goblin-wrought silver, my employer would be more than happy to take it off your hands. It is, in all likelihood, cursed, you know.” Tom smiled cordially. </p><p>Mr. Rosier smiled tightly and nodded. “I’ll bear that in mind, Tom.”</p><p>As the older man left the shop, Tom realized he’d forgotten his bloody scone.</p><p>Riddle walked back to the storage room and began to stock the shelves with new artifacts as he hatched his plan to kill the Editor-in-Chief of <em>The Daily Prophet.</em> </p>

<p align="center"> </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Hermione was back in her own time. She walked into a muggle coffee shop and there, in the corner, sat Harry and Ron. Hermione looked down at herself. She was wearing jeans and a green striped sweater, and converses. </em>
</p><p>
<em> She walked up to Harry and Ron. She simply stared at them. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Ron looked up at her. “Uh… Hermione… you okay?” </em>
</p><p>
<em> She couldn’t even speak for a moment. Then she cleared her throat. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Um- I’m- I’m fine. What are you two doing here?” </em>
</p><p>
<em> They looked at one another like she’d gone mental.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> “You said to meet you here. Said you had good news. We figured it was about your auror test,” said Harry. “Did you pass?” </em>
</p><p>
<em> Her mouth fell open. She looked around her. Everything looked so… so… normal. </em>
</p><p>
<em> No one wore trousers or skirts or dresses. They wore jeans and tee shirts and sneakers. Through the glass window, she saw modern cars driving by, not antique ones. </em>
</p><p>
<em> She looked back at Harry and Ron. “I… haven’t got my results yet.” She swallowed. How did she get back here? </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Well,” Ron gestured her forward. “Come and have a seat, then. What’s the good news? Bought you a coffee by the way. Hope you like lavender.” He handed her a cup. </em>
</p><p>
<em> She reached to take it. “Oh… Thank you. Lavender’s… my favorite.” Her heart beat rapidly. </em>
</p><p>
<em> She wanted to jump up and hug them both. She wanted to cry. To ask them how they’d been and if they missed her. She wanted to tell them she missed them terribly. She felt that everything she’d been through the past few months had been merely a terrible dream. </em>
</p><p>
<em> But they acted as if they hadn’t known she was gone. </em>
</p><p>
<em> So maybe she hadn’t been… </em>
</p><p>
<em> “The good news… is…” She didn’t know what to say. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Suddenly the door to the coffee shop opened. Hermione turned absentmindedly to see who it was. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Riddle. Tom Marvolo Riddle stood in the doorway, just inside the shop. </em>
</p><p>
<em> He wore black jeans, a Nirvana tee shirt, and black lace-up boots. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Hermione stared at him.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Riddle was wearing… muggle clothes. </em>
</p><p>
<em> He smiled when he caught her eye. </em>
</p><p>
<em> No… he was walking toward her. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Hermione,” Ron said in an alarmed voice. “Is that… who I think it is?” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “It is,” said Harry, drawing his wand.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> “How did he get here?” asked Ron. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “I don’t know, but he’s not staying,” Harry said viciously.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Wait,” Hermione breathed. “Umm... I can explain…” Her heart rate sped up. Had she brought him here? </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Explain what, Hermione?” shouted Ron. “That’s Tom Riddle!” </em>
</p><p>
<em> Tom walked up to them calmly. Ron and Harry stared as he approached Hermione and slid his arm around her waist. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Did you tell them the good news?” he murmured in her ear. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Ron and Harry had their wands pointed at Tom. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Hermione’s brow furrowed. “The… good news?” </em>
</p><p>
<em> Tom smirked and his eyes were warm as they watched her face. He reached down and gripped her wrist, lifting her hand into view. He held out her hand on display and she finally caught a glimpse of a ring on her finger. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Her ring finger. On her left hand. </em>
</p><p>
<em> A sparkling, oval-cut diamond glittered on her finger. The band was gold, and the bezel was comprised of an elegant serpent that wrapped itself around the sparkling jewel... an ouroboros. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Her mouth fell open.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Harry and Ron looked between Hermione and Tom. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Then they suddenly turned their wands on both of them. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “I can explain,” she said, anxiety rising in her voice. “This is some kind of mistake…” </em>
</p><p>
<em> Riddle turned to her. He gripped her chin and turned her face to his. “That isn’t what you said last night when you agreed to marry me, Hermione.”  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Suddenly the two of them were caught up in darkness. Ron and Harry disappeared. She heard only Riddle’s voice. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “You lied to me, Hermione. I know you used the Tempaestus. I know you want to kill me.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> She shook her head. “No!” His arms wrapped around her like chains. “Let me go, Tom!” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “You can’t kill me, Hermione. We’re one. The only way to kill me is to kill yourself. And I won’t let that happen. Never.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Let me go!”</em>
</p><p>
<em>"Look at me, Hermione."<br/><br/>Hermione opened her eyes and saw nothing in the darkness save for a skull... a serpent slithered in through its hollow eye socket and back out through its unhinged jaw.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Morsmordre...</em>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Hermione woke with a start and sat straight up in bed, breathing heavily. Her forehead was drenched in sweat, her thick curls clinging to the skin of her temples and the back of her neck. She thought she might vomit.</p><p>She ran to the bathroom and heaved a few times but nothing came up. After a moment, she curled up on the bathroom floor, shaking violently. Not only had the dream affected her strongly but the Giant’s ale had given her a terrible hangover.</p><p>She hated Riddle.</p><p>Hermione bent over and put her head between her knees, a trick she’d learned when she’d been on the run with Harry and Ron. Anytime her anxiety became too much, she would breathe with her head between her knees until it passed.</p><p>Her dream must have been a manifestation of her guilt. She had come home last night after her outing with Tom Riddle and she’d wept bitterly.</p><p>She had kissed Voldemort.</p><p>… and she had <em>enjoyed </em>it.</p><p>Hermione fucking hated herself.</p><p>He’d killed people. Murdered his father in cold blood. Killed Myrtle Warren like she was nothing. He would murder Hepzibah Smith for a locket and a cup.</p><p>He was <em>evil</em>.</p><p>She hated herself for the way her body responded when he touched her, when he kissed her. She hated herself for admiring his intelligence and magical prowess.</p><p>She hated herself for not wanting to go back home.</p><p>As lonely as she was here, she was <em>happier</em>. She felt important. She felt respected…</p><p>… and she <em>wanted </em>to kill Riddle. She <em>really </em>did.</p><p>Because she wanted to save everyone she ever cared about from the hurt and pain he would cause.</p><p>Was it even <em>possible </em>now to change the future? When the future had already occurred?</p><p>Where was she exactly? In an alternate timeline? If she did kill him now… would it even make a difference?</p><p>If she did indeed kill Voldemort… would she meet her friends again in her seventies?</p><p>
<em> Would they even know her? </em>
</p><p>Hermione felt the pressure and sadness begin to swallow her whole.</p><p>She felt immense pressure to kill Tom Riddle… to locate his horcruxes.</p><p>The demand was so great that she couldn’t breathe.</p><p>She knew she had to get close to him in order to do it…</p><p>But she didn’t trust herself with him.</p><p>
<em> Why was she so fucking weak? </em>
</p><p>Hermione knew she was sent here to do good. Some part of her suspected that fate had sent her to this time… but was she even accomplishing anything?</p><p>Hermione felt she was in a constant cycle of finding herself and losing herself in this unfamiliar time period.</p><p>She felt useless.</p><p>Utterly worthless.</p><p>And now she felt like a traitor.</p><p>A Judas.</p><p>A Benedict Arnold.</p><p>She’d been cavorting with the enemy like a whore. </p><p><em> That’s quite dramatic, </em>she thought to herself.</p><p>But it didn’t make her feel better…</p><p>… because it was <em>exactly </em>how she felt.</p><p>She’d <em>wanted </em>him to kiss her… and at that moment, when the heat pulsed between her legs and her body thrummed hungrily against his… she had wanted him to take her. She hadn’t thought about it consciously; her body simply responded to him of its own accord. <em> Him</em>. <em> Tom Riddle</em>. No one else had ever made her feel so <em>lustful</em>.</p><p>Not Viktor Krum. Not Ron. Not Abraxas Malfoy or Alphard Black.</p><p>Only Riddle.</p><p>It was almost as if she was no longer Hermione Granger, and he was not Lord Voldemort.</p><p>As if they were two completely different people…</p><p>Except they weren’t. </p><p>The worst part about it… was that she’d never even<em> had sex </em>before.</p><p>She, Hermione Granger, wanted to be fucked by a murderer.</p><p>An evil sociopath.</p><p>Her blood ran cold.</p><p>Useless. Worthless.</p><p>Traitor.</p><p><em> Whore</em>.</p><p>Hermione hung her head between her legs and cried.</p><p>She felt ashamed to face Dumbledore this Sunday.</p><p>He wouldn’t know anything, of course. But <em>she </em>would… and she would have to face him.</p><p>She decided that if Alphard Black were to owl her again, she would go see him. Perhaps he would take her thoughts off of Riddle. She would even let him kiss her, if it meant he could do away with the lingering memory of spearmint and tobacco.</p><p>Seeking relief and needing sleep desperately, she reached into her bag and realized she’d used up all her Dreamless Sleep potions. She felt around until her hand clasped a small vial of something. She pulled it out.</p><p>Elixir of Euphoria.</p><p>She popped the cork off and chugged it.</p><p>After a few minutes, a sweet, blissful feeling overcame her. Cloudy, hazy… happy. That’s how the elixir made her feel as it flooded her veins. Light. Carefree.</p><p>Her body filled with an airy feeling. Her fingertips tingled. </p><p>An easy smile formed on her lips.</p><p><em> That’s better, </em>she thought.</p><p>Relief came, if only for a while, and Hermione went back to sleep.</p><p>

</p><p>Tom knew who had sent the snake to Hermione.</p><p>When Tom had still been at Hogwarts, he and Walburga had used a similar spell to communicate the times and locations of their trysts. The snake would slither into his dorm room and transfigure into an envelope with her note. Then he would send it slithering back to her dorm room.</p><p>He supposed it was likely Walburga behind some of the gossip columns as well. </p><p>He wondered why he always chose to fuck <em> vindictive </em>little witches.</p><p><em> It’s miraculous, </em> he thought, <em> how much trouble a single irritating witch can cause. </em></p><p>Despite knowing that Walburga was likely the troublemaker, it still frustrated him that Hermione had received death threats and howlers.</p><p>Tom didn’t like Hermione being center stage in the wizarding world.</p><p>He didn’t like wizards like Abraxas Malfoy and Alphard Black vying for her attention.</p><p>When Tom discovered something he wanted, he preferred to keep it private. He <em>coveted </em>her. He wanted to hide her away like his horcruxes. But that was not an option. So he would have to be patient and bide his time.</p><p>Tom thought about how he would deal with Walburga. He knew that little Ciggy (Cygnus) was Walburga’s weakness. They were as close as siblings could get and the witch was quite protective of him. He thought about torturing Ciggy until Walburga cracked, but he didn’t particularly want to have to resort to that method. He rather liked Ciggy, after all.</p><p>He decided he would give her a warning before he took any drastic measures. </p><p>Tom pulled out a sheet of parchment and an envelope and wrote a little note addressed to Cygnus Black. He signed the note, <em> LV</em>. When he was finished, he charmed the envelope and it transfigured instantly into a scaly green-black serpent with red eyes. It slithered off to do Tom’s bidding with a wave of his wand.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Hermione stood, on the grounds of Hogwarts, in the room where she’d first learned to duel. Albus Dumbledore stood examining her form, correcting her stance, and pointing out minor adjustments she might make to improve her stature during a duel. </p><p>“Albus,” Hermione began before they started another round of practice. “I’ve been meaning to ask… and I don’t expect the answer to be any different from the last time I asked, but… have you learned anything about time travel? Have you discovered anything new that might help me?”</p><p>Hermione didn’t even dare to hope. She knew that wizards had only begun to make strides in the field of time travel during her own time, and they were only able to send someone back for a matter of hours at the most. Not years. The fact that Riddle had discovered a way to effectively bring someone so many decades back in time without killing them or driving them to insanity, which easily could’ve been her fate… well, that was an almost impossible accomplishment. </p><p>Again, her admiration for him rose to the surface against her will. She shoved it back down, and the nausea which accompanied it.</p><p>“I’m afraid, Miss Granger, that I have discovered nothing further that could help you. It is not for lack of searching, however. I have made several inquiries into the ministry, and into the Department of Mysteries, and I have reached out to several old friends of mine who are quite experienced and knowledgeable in the field. But there are no definitive answers or tested experiments, and I would not have your life endangered. Did you say that the object which sent you here was created by the very dark wizard you fought in your time?”</p><p>Hermione bit her lip against the disappointment. “Yes, sir.”</p><p>Albus sighed. “Then I fear, at this time, the only alternative is to seek out that individual and attempt to learn his secrets. Perhaps, Hermione, there is a way to learn the art of creating such an object, were you to gain his trust. That is, of course, if such a path would not endanger your life further. You will have to decide if the risk is worth the possible reward.”</p><p>Hermione nodded. “Yes, of course. It seems to be the only option, unfortunately. I’ve researched and combed through books until my eyes are crossing. I’ve found nothing that might help me.”</p><p>Albus looked at Hermione piercingly. “I can understand how difficult it must be to be separated from everyone you love, and who loves you in return. Your parents must be a very grievous loss for you.”</p><p>Hermione ground her teeth, holding back tears. She swallowed thickly. “They are. If I can be completely honest, Albus, I feel as if I’m fighting a war inside myself. Part of me misses my own time terribly. But then…” Her voice grew small and quiet. “Part of me doesn’t want to go back. The guilt is tearing me apart.”</p><p>Albus said nothing. He walked toward Hermione, standing before her as she looked down at her shoes. She couldn’t look at him. She would only feel shame, and seeing his blue eyes would remind her of the Dumbledore of her time, and his passing, and the circumstances of his passing. Albus placed a hand softly on her shoulder. “Hermione.” His voice was soft.</p><p>Hermione sniffled, blinking away tears and quickly wiping the escaping offenders from her cheeks with the edge of her robes. She met his gaze tentatively. “You have been forced to adjust to your regrettable circumstances. It is only natural to acclimate yourself and accept what cannot be changed. I must say you have done so beautifully, with much more grace than I could have managed myself. But I must say…” His brow drew forward. “I have grown quite attached to you. Despite myself, although I’ve told myself countless times that you must go back to your own time and that there’s every possibility that you may not be here… long <em> term </em>.” He cleared his throat. “I have begun to see you as a daughter in truth. I would be loathe to part from you, should the time ever come when you must go. So you’ll forgive me if I selfishly hope that such a time never comes.”</p><p>Tears sprung over Hermione’s eyes and she stepped forward, flinging her arms around Albus’ neck. He stood in shock for a moment before slowly bringing his arms around her shoulders. Hermione tucked her face into the place where his shoulder met his neck and cried out her heaviness into his indigo robes, leaving dark tear stains on his shoulder.</p><p>After a few minutes, Hermione pried her arms from around Albus’ neck. She wiped her tears away in embarrassment and almost immediately, they began to discuss dueling again. </p><p>“Hermione, I would like to share something with you that I’ve never shared with anyone before. I suppose it’s my own worry for your safety that makes me want to teach you. It is a particularly difficult use of magic. I only know one other wizard who has managed to master it, besides myself. And that particular individual is the wizard who taught it to me.”</p><p>Hermione’s eyes grew very wide. “I want to learn. <em> Please </em> teach me.”</p><p>He chuckled at her earnestness. “If you possess the magical strength to learn this technique, it will most certainly take you time to achieve it. We will practice every week until you master it. I should know within a few lessons whether you are strong enough.”</p><p>Hermione began to salivate. Hunger burst forward, filling her chest. “What is this technique, sir?”</p><p>Dumbledore’s blue eyes were piercing when they turned on her. “When dueling, most wizards are only able to cast one spell at a time. They either cast or shield. Some wizards, if very skilled, are able to cast and shield simultaneously. There is a teaching which states that a wand is only able to cast one curse at a time, but that is incorrect. There is a skill that enables a witch or wizard to cast multiple spells or curses at once. It does tend to drain one’s magical energy significantly, however, I’ve never been in a duel where any magic was needed after effectively utilizing this technique. To cast three curses at an opponent who can only shield against one curse… well, that tends to end a duel.”</p><p>Hermione’s mouth fell open. </p><p>“Of course, I’ve only cast three spells simultaneously at one time, myself. Usually, two curses and a shield are the best use of the practice. It is possible to cast all three using one’s wand, but it requires great mental strength and occlumency skills. The easiest way to use this skill is to cast once with one’s wand, silently, another wandlessly, and another using your mouth, an utterance. You have to be able to occlude these thoughts… separate them so as to think them all simultaneously. It is very difficult, Hermione, and I will not be at all disappointed or think less of you if you cannot achieve this particular skill. Some of the greatest wizards on earth have not been able to master it.”</p><p>Hermione’s mouth snapped shut. “I <em> have </em> to learn it, Albus. I <em> must </em>.”</p><p>Albus smiled. “Very good. I will try my best to teach you, although I fear I may be a more inept teacher than the wizard who instructed me. First, we will begin with the ability to occlude your thoughts in preparation. We will start with bi-casting. You will learn to cast and shield at the same time. Then, once you have mastered it, we will move on to bi-curses, and strengthen your magical stamina.”</p><p>For the next three hours they practiced, and the two of them barely noticed the time passing. </p><p>Hermione felt much lighter that night when she returned to her flat, despite a splitting headache and severe magical exhaustion.</p><p>She did not, in fact, need Euphoria Elixir to sleep that night. Her dreams were still fitful and amorphous, and she woke the next morning with the sensation of fingers tightly tangled in her hair.</p>

<em>Snapshots of June </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Walburga, who is LV?”</p><p>The eldest Black daughter lifted her head from her book. She sat in the parlor of Grimmauld Place. Her younger brother Cygnus was home from Hogwarts for the summer, and he had begged her to spend as much time with him as possible before he went back in September.</p><p>Walburga glanced at him absentmindedly. “What are you on about, Ciggy?”</p><p>He held up a cream-colored parchment. “This envelope came today. It was a serpent with red eyes and then transformed into a letter.”</p><p>Walburga’s eyes widened to the size of saucers. She tossed her book aside and shot to her feet, snatching the parchment from his hand. </p><p>She recognized the sharp, spiky penmanship instantly. Her blood ran cold.</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<em> My dearest Ciggy, </em>
</p><p align="center">
<em> Please inform your sister that her recent actions have caught my attention. </em>
</p><p align="center">
<em> I am merciful enough to issue this word of caution before any corrective measures are taken. </em>

</p><p align="center">

<br/>
</p><p>Walburga’s veins were like ice. She gazed at her young brother and swallowed.</p><p>“Who is LV? What does it mean?”<br/><br/>She shook her head as she folded the letter, attempting to calm her racing heart. “Nothing, Ciggy. Come, I’ll take you for ice cream.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p align="center">
<em> <strong><br/>June 15, 1948</strong> </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Every eye turned on Hermione when she walked into The Daily Prophet this morning. In the few months she’d been a columnist at the paper, she had become something of a legend. Several of the younger writers looked up to her, while many of the elder writers were quite resentful of her resounding success. They bitterly attributed her attainments to nepotism, believing it was the name of her infamous Father which had led to her inexplicable promotion.</p><p>Hermione didn’t care what they thought or believed. She had a job to do; a purpose. She had not ceased to write her articles pointing out the injustices and prejudices that pervaded the wizarding world. To her surprise, Riddle had not made any attempt to stop her. He had not owled, nor stopped by her flat or her work. He’d made no attempt to contact her since the night they had kissed.</p><p>It made her nervous.</p><p>Part of her wondered if he’d forgotten about her, or if his anger at her refusal to comply with his wishes had infuriated him to the point that he no longer wished to see her. Or perhaps, she’d been right. Perhaps their little “date” had been nothing more than an attempt to convince her to stop writing, and when he’d realized she would not comply, he’d given up contact. Her mind had touched upon all of these possibilities, but deep within herself, she knew that none of them were the truth.</p><p>She wasn’t sure what the truth was, but she had the distant feeling that he was planning something.<br/><br/>She hoped desperately that her intuition was wrong.</p><p>It had been exactly one month since Tom had kissed her in front of the cottage in Godric’s Hollow. Since then, Hermione had avoided Riddle like the plague. Abraxas had owled her several times, reminding her of her promise to make use of his library for her research and inviting her to various events, even asking her over for tea a few times. In truth, the library was magnificent and would be perfect for working on her articles, but she hadn’t wanted to run the risk of running into Riddle there. She felt bad for rejecting Malfoy’s many invitations and entreaties, and she knew that she would have to accept soon to avoid seeming rude.</p><p>Hermione made her way to her desk along the front wall of the second floor. The floor-to-ceiling window provided her with a view of the farthest end of Diagon Alley. Every morning she got to work just a little bit early because, through the window in front of her desk, she could see the busy hustle and bustle of the street every morning. But if she arrived early enough, the street would be relatively clear save for the crisp morning fog, and she could catch a glimpse of Tom Riddle crossing the street from the apparation point before making his way to the entrance of Knockturn Alley. He often stopped at the newsstand across the street from The Daily Prophet and picked up the morning edition. She could have sworn that a few times, he almost smiled when gazing at the front page.</p><p>This was the only bit of contact that she allowed herself. It was her little morning routine, her guilty pleasure. She never failed to arrive at work early so that she could watch him walk by.</p><p> </p><hr/><p align="center">
<br/>
<em> <strong>June 19, 1948</strong> </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Tom Riddle apparated into a dark forest on the outskirts of Tirana, Albania.</p><p>Almost fifteen hundred miles.</p><p>He instantly fell to his hands and knees and vomited profusely. Then, he sucked in several deep breaths. </p><p>His chest felt very thin and his stomach twisted in knots. He reached into his pocket and gripped the vial of a potion he’d brewed to combat the adverse effects of the apparation. He turned over with a groan and fell onto his back.</p><p>He lay there for about ten minutes, waiting for his head to quit swimming and his vision to cease its spinning. Once he stopped seeing double, he sat up cautiously. </p><p>The potion worked swiftly, and within another five minutes, Tom was up and on his feet. He didn’t dare risk another apparation so soon, so he made his way on foot up the side of the hill. He used the magical compass in his possession to locate the particular cleft in the rock. He vowed to make a portkey from the apparition point to the cave for his next visit. It would be much easier than hiking after such a taxing apparation. Even Tom’s immense stores of magical power were drained by the endeavor. The safehouse was protected by the Fidelius charm, but Tom had been given the coordinates by Zephyris, its secret keeper.</p><p>Tom muttered an incantation and suddenly the cleft parted and he walked into an enormous stone courtyard. The light of the moon filtered into the stone cavern from an opening in the ceiling. Carved-out columns and doorways appeared, leading into tunnels and corridors which housed rooms in the rock. On the right side of the cavern, a waterfall spilled over into a pool; the stars were reflected like gemstones on its deep blue surface. The reflection of the moon on the water cast blue, wave-like shadows on the stone walls.</p><p>Tom stood there for several moments in amazement, taking in its beauty. Very few things impressed Tom Riddle as beautiful. This cavern happened to be one of them.</p><p>“Tom Riddle,” came a deep, gravelly voice, its guttural dialect echoing in the acoustics of the dark cavern.</p><p>“Zephyris.”</p><p>The man stepped forward into the moonlight. He was tall, around ten feet high, Riddle guessed. His hair was white as snow; it was partially tied back, and fell in long, cascading waves around his shoulders. His skin was dark and tanned and wrinkled as if from years of biting wind. The wizard’s eyes were a dark crimson color. He wore silver robes and his wand was black and knotted, made of ebony. </p><p>“I cannot stay,” Riddle said as the half-giant approached. “Not this time. When I return, we will conduct the exchange. But tonight, I need you to perform the Unbreakable Vow. Take me to Dominik. He will make the vow tonight, and then take the Dark Mark.”</p><p>The wizard nodded and placed a hand on Riddle’s shoulder in greeting. Then, he led Riddle into one of the stone tunnels, and they disappeared into darkness.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p align="center">
<em> <strong>June 23, 1948</strong> </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“To what do I owe this… <em> unexpected </em> pleasure, Black?”<br/><br/>Walburga Black stood at the door of Tom’s flat.<br/><br/>She looked at him nervously. “Can I come in?”<br/><br/>The look that Tom gave her was one utterly devoid of any emotion. It was like he wasn’t even looking at her at all, but looking through her at something else which caught his attention. Irritation wasn’t even present; there was simply nothing in his eyes.<br/><br/>He stood back, holding the door open as she walked through. </p><p>Walburga stood looking at him for a moment. She’d had all her words planned out in advance; a perfectly plotted out speech. They left her the instant her blue eyes met his black ones. </p><p>She swallowed. “You threatened my brother? For what…? Over Hermione Dumbledore? <em> Really </em>, Tom?”</p><p>He stared at her blankly.</p><p>She shook her head in disbelief. “You’ve known her what… a few months? I’ve known you since we were children. You… you played <em> chess </em> with Ciggy last Christmas.”</p><p>Tom blinked and said nothing.</p><p>Her face broke, her bottom lip trembling. “Say something, you <em> fucking </em> coward!”</p><p>His eyes narrowed menacingly. “Walburga.” There was no statement, only a hint of warning in his tone.</p><p>She nodded angrily. “Right. Right, you’ll hurt my brother if I go against you. Right?! You’ll threaten and you’ll torture us like you do your Knights. You’ll kill him like you killed your father. You’d kill me in a <em> moment </em> , I know you would.” A sob broke free from her throat. She covered her mouth with her hand, her words muffled, incoherent sobs as they passed through her fingers. “Why are you <em> like </em> this, Tom? And why do I love you?”</p><p>Tom blinked slowly, then released a breath. He walked forward and took her chin between his knuckle and thumb, lifting her face until she looked up at him. She looked at his cold eyes, the gaunt angles of his seemingly perfect face, the curling black hair that fell over his forehead. “I can’t love you, Walburga. You know that I can’t.”</p><p>She ejected her breath in a bitter laugh. “You can’t love anyone, Tom. You think you might be able to love her?” She shook her head. “You’re wrong. You can’t.”</p><p>He cocked his head to the side, gazing down at her. “You might be right. But that still doesn’t help your plight, now, does it?”</p><p>Her face twisted into an acidic scowl. “You would have me marry Orion, then?”</p><p>He nodded once, his face a blank mask. “I would.”</p><p>She shook her head in disbelief. “You haven’t… you haven’t thought about what it would be like? You and I?”</p><p>He shook his head. “Never.”</p><p>She nodded, her lips drawn tight. “Does she even <em> want </em> you, Tom? From what I see, she’s got her sights set on my brother.”</p><p>Tom’s eyes sharpened perceptibly. His jaw tensed. “It’s none of your concern, Walburga. Keep your nose out of it, like I’ve warned you. I don’t have any desire to hurt you, or your brother. If you interfere, you won’t leave me any choice.”</p><p>The eldest Black daughter stood gazing at the man who haunted her nights, her thoughts, and her dreams. She’d imagined so many paths for her life and they had all included him, every one. He’d dropped her heart on its edge and shattered it into a million pieces, and he’d done it coldly, without remorse, without so much as a backward glance. She felt the breath leaving her lungs. </p><p>Walburga didn’t cry. She’d cried so many tears over Tom Riddle this summer that she seemingly had none left. Her beautiful blue eyes were swollen and red-rimmed.</p><p>“You won’t hurt my brother, will you? Alphard?”</p><p>Tom gazed at Walburga. He didn’t say yes or no. He just stared at her.</p><p>“Please don’t,” she whispered.</p><p>Tom took a deep breath and leaned his head back, staring at the ceiling. “I don’t believe I’ll have to, Walburga. I don’t see your brother as an issue. He’s quite inconsequential. He always has been.”</p><p>She swallowed and nodded, looking down at her hands which were clasped tightly. Her long black nails dug into her pale skin. She used the pain to keep herself from going completely numb.</p><p>She looked back at Tom. Silence spread between them. She missed his hands; his violence. She missed the way he called her a whore.</p><p>She didn’t mind being called a whore. Because she was always <em> his </em> whore.</p><p>But not anymore.</p><p>She hated Hermione Dumbledore with every fiber of her being. She hated her because she knew that Tom wanted Hermione in a way he had never wanted Walburga. Jealousy curled inside her stomach, tightening its grip on her heart, and stole the breath from her lungs. It flooded her veins like poison.</p><p>“They’ve set my engagement party for next month. I don’t expect you’ll be there. I don’t think Orion will want you to be… or my mother, for that matter.”</p><p>Tom flicked his eyes over at Walburga. “I believe congratulations are in order. Don’t worry, Black, you’ll have your little pureblood heirs and you’ll forget all about the orphan boy whose dick you used to suck.”</p><p>The comment was so cold that it set her aback. Her mouth fell halfway open as she looked at Riddle. It was in that moment that she realized Riddle had never cared for her in any capacity; it was just some imagined, girlish dream of hers. Wishful thinking on her part. The comment had come from a place of deep-rooted bitterness within Tom’s own person. Walburga knew, in some distant part of her mind, that in ten years, or perhaps twenty, she would finally get over Tom Riddle, and she would thank the gods that she never married him. But that day had not come yet, and she now felt nothing but hatred.</p><p>Both for Tom, and the Dumbledore bitch.</p><p>As she walked out through the door of Tom’s flat, she cast one last glance at him. He seemed like a stranger; an immovable statue of cold stone. She wanted to kiss him one last time, to taste the boy who had gotten her through years of school at Hogwarts. She recalled waking in the mornings in the coolness of her dorm room in the dungeons, Tom being the foremost thought in her mind at all times. </p><p>She knew he wouldn’t taste the same.</p><p>Walburga left his flat and apparated back to Grimmauld Place. Then she vowed that she would try to kill Hermione Dumbledore, even if she ended up in Azkaban for it, even if Tom himself strangled herself to death.</p><p>At least she would die with the sweet taste of revenge on her lips.<br/><br/></p><hr/><p> </p><p align="center">
<em> <strong>June 30, 1948</strong> </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Alphard watched Hermione as she stood looking out through the endless glass wall of her flat.  The gardens on the terrace, which were normally colorful and glittering with lights in the evening, were foggy and greyscale beneath the dim light of the storm clouds.</p><p>“What are you thinking about, Hermione?”</p><p>The brown curtain of her hair fell uniformly past her shoulders.  She’d smoothed it with some kind of charm. He liked it any way she wore it. When she spoke, her syllables were sharp and geometric, almost as if she spoke another language, and he felt vaguely that she wasn’t speaking to him, but to herself. "I was thinking about my childhood.  My mother and I used to spend each summer in the south, in the forests, on the beaches, when I was younger. Before I discovered my magic. I spent days in the forests without sleep, mapping out the sunny spots and the wet, green places.  I gave the beech trees and the rivers names.  I imagined the trees whispered passwords to me.  I hiked even in the rain. I used to imagine there were fairies in the trees."  She looked at Alphard, and he realized that she was speaking to him, after all.  "It's strange that I was desiring the kind of world that would exist for me one day. As if I knew it existed, or even willed it into being."</p><p>Alphard sat silent and intent, his mismatched eyes watchful. </p><p>He struggled to understand Hermione sometimes, but he’d decided that she was the most enigmatic woman he’d ever met, and it made him want her even more. He wanted to kiss her, but anytime he’d shown the intent, she had rebuffed him.</p><p>She breathed a deep, tight breath.  Her body was draped in a backless ivory gown of satin.  He had brought her back to her flat after escorting her to a Ministry event for the ICW, and she’d invited him in for the first time. Her back was arched, with shoulder blades resting against the window's diamond-paned frame as she leaned backward.  Her long arms were crossed, with one hand holding a glass of wine whose rim she rested against her chin.  Her delicate nails were painted a dark maroon.  Alphard thought to himself that she was a beautiful, terrible girl.  Thunder cracked and rain pelted so hard in the wind that he feared the glass behind her would be shattered. She was staring at him as if she knew what he was thinking, and her glance told him that she would have stood immovable, her back still arched backward as if the glass still stood.  Her cold serenity impressed Alphard as an unbreakable thing.  Behind her, the scenery of the garden was blurred by the river of rain upon the glass.</p><p>Her lips barely parted as she spoke.  "I used to think it spoke to me."</p><p>"What? The rain?"</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>"What did it say?"<br/><br/>A moment passed before she smiled sadly, an echo of regret tinting her expression.  "I can't remember… It’s been so long since I was listening."</p>

<b> <em>July 3, 1948</em> </b>
</p><p> </p><p>Tom Riddle sat in the darkest corner of The Leaky Cauldron on a Saturday morning. He’d arrived early, intent on eating breakfast before his Death Eaters showed up for their usual meeting. They would all eat together, but he would not eat with them. Eating with them would imply community, camaraderie… even friendship. Familiarity. Intimacy. But they were not his comrades nor his friends. They were his followers. </p><p>The thought of eating with them irked him, like a pebble in his shoe that he couldn’t locate or get rid of. It was another of his compulsive behaviors; he always ate alone. He thought perhaps a mind healer would find that interesting. However, he had no intention of ever letting another human being near his mind. He imagined the wires in his mind were all crossed incorrectly. He didn’t mind it. He presumed that divergence was the very thing that made him a magical genius, and if given the choice between a fucked up brain and being normal like all the other sods… he’d choose a twisted mind any day.</p><p>He was just finishing up a proper English breakfast of toast, bacon, sausage, mushrooms, grilled tomatoes, sunny-side-up eggs, and black pudding with a cup of strong black coffee. It made him rather sick, truthfully, since he hadn’t eaten so much in one sitting in weeks.</p><p>At a few minutes to seven, Mulciber walked in and Tom waved him over. He wanted to have a little chat before the rest of his Death Eaters arrived.</p><p>“Good morning, My Lord.”</p><p>“Good morning, Mulciber. Have you any news on what I asked you to do last week?”</p><p>The tall, blonde Death Eater nodded. “Everything checks out. Her background, documents, identification… Everything the Ministry has on her. I performed legilimens on the clerks in the records and census department. It doesn’t appear there’s anything shady… Unless someone is adept at memory charms or obliviation. Any tracks have been well covered.”</p><p>Tom nodded, furrowing his brow as he thought.</p><p>Mulciber continued, “If she’s not who she says she is, the only way to find out is to either seek out some contacts… someone who knew her mother well and perform legilimens on them. Maybe veritaserum. Aside from that… you may have to perform legilimens on <em> her </em>. It may be the only way.”</p><p>Tom’s eyes snapped sharply to Mulciber’s. It was something he had considered. He could obliviate her afterward and she would be none the wiser. </p><p>There were two things that stopped him. First, he recalled her occlumency from the Ostara Ball. He remembered encountering her rock-solid mental walls, which indicated that she was a relatively skilled occlumens. Tom inferred that she must have trained with a powerful occlumens, and while Tom was powerful enough to still override her will and penetrate her mind, it would be a forceful and painful invasion… a kind of <em> rape </em>of the mind, which was the second reason that Tom didn’t want to perform the spell on her. He wouldn’t feel right about violating her in such a manner. If it were anyone else, Tom wouldn’t hesitate. But Tom had impulsively decided that if he were to discover her secrets, he would do so through a battle of wits, not sheer, brute magical strength.</p><p>He did want to keep a certain level of trust between them, after all. Even if she was a filthy little liar.</p><p>Perhaps she had reason to be secretive.</p><p>So Tom decided that he would uncover her secrets on his own, or he would earn her trust and make her spill them.</p><p>“Do not breathe a word of this to a single soul, Mulciber. Do you understand?”</p><p>“Yes, my Lord.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p align="center">
<b> <em>July 7, 1948</em> </b>
</p><p> </p><p>Hermione knew Tom’s schedule now. She’d watched him walking to and from work for several weeks now through the window in front of her desk at <em> The Daily Prophet </em>. Unlike her, he had specific days off every week. He worked Monday through Saturday, with Sundays and Tuesdays off. Today was Wednesday, and Hermione was home at her flat. She only went in on days that she needed to work on her articles, had collaborations, or had staff meetings, although she was required at the ministry on many of her off days to oversee the work on Midas Bank.</p><p>It had been weeks now and he had neither owled nor visited.</p><p>Any other girl would have been furious at being kissed and dumped, essentially, but Hermione thanked her lucky stars. Despite the frustrating fact that Riddle was potentially her <em> only </em> way back to her time, she wanted nothing more than to stay as far away from him as possible for the time being. Once she overcame the <em> ridiculous </em> infatuation she had for him, she would be ready to hatch a plan to steal his horcruxes and kill him. She had to be able to trust herself around him, and after these many weeks, Hermione felt that she was finally starting to succumb to the separation and feel normal again.</p><p>However, the motherly side of Hermione plagued her, because she noticed during her morning vigil that Riddle was growing rather thin. He had always been lean and slightly muscular, but of late, he was looking a bit gaunt and his eyes had almost permanent dark shadows beneath them. It irritated her to no end because it didn’t seem to affect his handsomeness <em> at all </em> and it also pricked Hermione’s sensitive heart, making her want to cook for him and <em> force </em> him to sleep a full eight hours for once.</p><p>Hermione loved baking. She always had, even as a child. It was one of the few things besides reading that she did to unwind; a therapy of sorts. This morning, she had a kettle boiling on the stove and an oven full of orange and cranberry scones. She slid her oven mitt on and popped them out of the oven; they were golden brown and looked positively mouth-watering. Piksy sat on the counter beside her, swinging her legs. She’d done all the housework that there was to do and Hermione had been forced to <em> command </em> her to stop trying to make the scones for her. It had been absolutely unfathomable to the elf that Hermione <em> wanted </em> to bake them herself.</p><p>“If you stop trying to help, you can eat some scones, but <em>only</em> if you sit and <em>be</em> <em>still</em>,” Hermione fussed, exasperated. With that slight bit of motivation, Piksy finally simmered and busied herself with trimming flowers for a centerpiece.</p><p>Hermione whipped up a glaze with some butter, confectioners sugar, orange zest, and vanilla. She drizzled it gingerly over the top of the scones, then stood back and admired her work. She brought her fingers together and kissed them.</p><p>“That’s what you call, chef’s kiss, Piksy!” </p><p>Piksy hovered over the scones, sniffing them longingly. “But is we kissing the scones or is we eating them?”</p><p>Hermione doubled over with laughter. “Piksy,” she said, breathless with laughter. “You can eat as many scones as you like, just save a couple.”</p><p>Once Piksy had sufficiently gorged herself, Hermione placed two scones on a plate with a little note. She wrapped it up and gave it to Piksy.</p><p>“Piksy, I want you to take this to a little shop in Knockturn Alley. It’s called Borgin and Burkes. Leave it on the counter, but don’t let <em> anyone </em> see you. Do you think you can do that?”</p><p>Piksy looked at her with giant eyes and a big smile. “Yes, I can do, Miss Dumbledore!”<br/>

</p><hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Tom Riddle had just finished a sale with a customer who purchased a blood quill and an enchanted music box that would cause the listener to fall asleep, earning him a sizeable commission considering the customer hadn’t even planned on purchasing anything upon entering the shop. They <em> all </em> said that. If anyone could convince someone to part with their gold, it was <em> charming </em> Tom Riddle.</p><p>Tom actually enjoyed the work. It was quite easy, and he met a lot of witches and wizards who possessed invaluable information. For some reason, people loved to talk to the handsome young Riddle. They told him many things, and largely thanks to the kind of clientele that frequented the shop, Tom learned a great deal about various kinds of dark magic that he’d never read about in any books.</p><p>Mr. Burke begrudgingly counted out Riddle’s commission in the back room. Caractarus Burke considered Riddle an invaluable addition to his shop. The shop had tripled in sales since he’d hired the charismatic shopboy, and he counted it his immense good fortune that the young man wanted to work at his shop despite the countless offers he’d received to work at the Ministry of Magic. Mr. Burke was rather tired of counting out commissions for the boy, though. Young Riddle was amassing quite the stack of galleons of late.</p><p>“What do you buy with all your money, Riddle?” asked Mr. Burke.</p><p>“Books.”</p><p>“What kind of books?”</p><p>Riddle tossed the older gentleman a glance, his lips slightly upturned in a mysterious smile. “The kind of books that would curl your hair.” He looked up at the man’s balding head. “If you had any, that is.”</p><p>Mr. Burke guffawed heartily at the young man’s sinister joke and then gestured around at the interior of the shop. “Look around you, boy. There’s not much that could curl my hair.”</p><p>Tom smirked.<em> I bet I could </em>, he thought. Riddle made his way back out to the front desk and suddenly something caught his eye. Tom made his way up to the desk and found a small plate upon which sat two scones. Tom cocked his head to the side as he examined the offering because he’d just been out in the front of the shop only minutes ago and there had been no one else around. He reached out and touched one of the scones. It was still warm.</p><p>That’s when he caught sight of a small bit of parchment on the side of the plate. He unfolded it. It read, ‘<em> For the shopboy. </em>’ There was nothing else written, no signature… nothing.</p><p>Tom Riddle’s eyes narrowed as he stared at the scones. On a whim of intuition, he lifted the note to his nose and inhaled deeply. He caught the strong aroma of orange, then vanilla, and then the scent of fresh parchment… but then, because he was looking for it, he also detected a more faint note of lavender.</p><p>But how could the scones be from Hermione? And how had she gotten them here?</p><p>It seemed like such an out-of-character gesture for her, especially considering that she had avoided him so adamantly the last few weeks.</p><p>After a moment of reflection, Riddle’s dream came rushing back to him. Hermione in strange clothing, baking scones… and <em> complaining </em> that he’d been too <em> thin </em>.</p><p>His jaw jutted to the side and he laughed. </p><p>Riddle had never known himself to be a seer… but then again, perhaps his connection with Hermione had tuned his senses into her more strongly and allowed him to <em> see </em> things magically where she was concerned.</p><p>So then, did that mean that there was also a connection between Hermione and the Tempaestus? Had she come from the future? It was a thought he'd had more than once. Riddle’s eyes narrowed. He couldn’t be sure, but many things would make sense if she had. </p><p>And if she had... Then the Tempaestus had worked. Did that mean she was a follower of his?  No... that couldn't be. Something had gone wrong then.</p><p>But it was possible that she wasn't from the future at all. He had thought and thought about it, but he just couldn't seem to fit the pieces together. There was always a piece out of place.</p><p>He knew that he was slowly unpacking her secrets. He just had to bide his time. </p><p>He would let his witch feel safe and comfortable for the time being. Let her even distract herself with Alphard Black.</p><p>It wouldn’t be long before all her feelings of false safety came crashing down…</p><p>His witch wasn’t aware that he’d already confunded Alphard twice now, peeked inside his mind, then obliviated the son of a bitch afterward.</p><p>He’d decided that if Alphard had fucked her, he would kill him on the spot.</p><p>Perhaps, even over a kiss, if Riddle was feeling irritable.</p><p>But what Tom hadn’t anticipated was how loyal she already was to him…</p><p>She <em>couldn’t</em> kiss Black.</p><p>When Tom pulled out of the bastard’s mind, he’d been dumbstruck.</p><p>She’d avoided Black’s advances like the plague, and yet, she continued to see him. Quite frequently, in fact.</p><p>Tom had taken great pleasure in the feelings of confusion and rejection in Black's thoughts. The longing he felt for Hermione which Tom himself was all too familiar with.</p><p>Perhaps he would let her toy with the bastard a bit longer.</p><p>Tom smirked to himself. Scones, indeed.</p><p>She was <em>worried</em> about Tom.</p><p>He looked down at the scones and fought back a smile.</p><p>
<em> Very well, little witch. I will try to eat more. </em>
</p><p>He lifted one of the scones and took a bite. His eyebrows lifted instantly. Had she bought these? Or made them?</p><p><em> If the witch can cook like this, </em> he thought. <em> Then I might just marry her. </em></p><p><br/>

<em> <strong>July 17, 1948</strong> </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Walburga stood in the bathroom, staring at her reflection. Her formal robes were expensive and gaudy, just her mother’s taste. She hadn’t cared what she wore for her engagement party, so she’d let her mother decide. She was normally pretty, but she was pale of late, with dark circles beneath her eyes. She gazed back at herself in the mirror, barely recognizing the witch of the reflection.</p><p>She reached for the vial of calming draught and tipped it back. She wished she had something stronger. Perhaps she would toss back all the fire whiskey she could find tonight. She didn’t particularly care whether she got sloshed and made a scene. She was doing what they had all asked her to do, anyway. She was marrying her cousin, the person her family had designated that she would marry since she was an infant. Walburga didn’t care anymore.</p><p>She didn’t care about any of it. They could poison her wine, and tonight could be her funeral for all she cared. Her life was over anyway. She’d marry Orion. She’d be the perfect little pureblood prize of the Black family. That’s all she was ever meant to be.</p><p>She could hear the guests all mingling. She heard their voices and their glasses clinking as they said ‘cheers.’ She supposed they all considered her engagement to be a roaring success. Everyone but her.</p><p>Walburga reached into her pocket and withdrew his badge. When they’d left Hogwarts, Walburga had nicked Tom’s Prefect badge from his suitcase while he was showering. It was easy to find; he had never had many possessions. He’d never shown much inclination toward material things. His concern was always <em> magic </em>.</p><p>She opened the pin on the back of the badge and then dragged the sharp point across the skin of her wrist. A thin cut appeared on her arm; red seeped upward and out of the cut, blood beading along the seam where her skin opened.</p><p>She glanced back at her reflection, then tucked the pin back into her pocket.</p><p>When she returned to the drawing room, in front of hundreds of guests, London’s finest pureblood royalty, Orion Black got down on one knee in front of Walburga and presented her with a two-hundred-year-old heirloom, marquis-cut diamond ring. It had belonged to his mother, his grandmother, and his great-grandmother. </p><p>Horrified tears rose to Walburga’s wild eyes and then spilled over. They seemingly wouldn’t stop. She tried to smile, but the smile that she painted on her face was unsure and pained. Her hand shook as she held it out to Orion, and he held it steady as he slipped the ring on her finger.</p><p>Everyone in the room murmured a collective ‘aww’ at the rivulets of tears pouring down her pale cheeks, at the nervous trembling of her hands.</p><p>Walburga thought she might faint.</p><p>She would have, had Orion not stood and wrapped his arms around her, providing her with a moment of support. </p><p>“Just breathe, Walburga,” he whispered against her hair. She nodded, her hysterical tears staining his dress robes.</p><p>A round of happy applause echoed around the room. Women dabbed at their eyes with their husband’s handkerchiefs. The room dissolved into happy laughter, clinking glasses, and muffled murmurs.</p><p>She’d never even said yes.</p><p><br/>
<br/>

<em> <strong>July 26, 1948</strong> </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Tom lay on his bed, staring at the ceiling. It was dark, so dark that he couldn’t make out any outlines or silhouettes in the room. There was no moon, nor any stars out tonight. He felt the pervading darkness as if it were a reflection of his soul. He held his hand out in front of him, but he saw nothing but blackness.</p><p>All he could think about were those scones and the scent of lavender. The smell had since faded from the little piece of parchment, but he kept it on his nightstand anyway. </p><p>He felt very cold tonight. He hadn’t realized how much warmth Hermione had introduced into his life until she’d disappeared from it for nearly two months. Tom ground his teeth, willing himself to be patient.</p><p>For the first few weeks, he’d wanked every morning thinking about that kiss, her skin, her taste, the warmth of her body against his.</p><p>But now… he simply couldn’t. He didn’t want the thought of her skin or the memory of her moaning. He wanted her thoughts, her words, and her smile. The thought of cumming all over his stomach instead of inside her made him physically sick.</p><p>He felt savage and violent tonight. He wanted to chain her up with iron manacles that bruised her wrists… he wanted to choke her for driving him fucking insane. He was bitterly angry that he wanted her so viscerally.</p><p>His muscles were tight. </p><p>Insomnia set in.</p><p>Tom stood up and began to pace in the dark, naked save for the gold and black ring on his index finger. </p><p>He wanted to grab his wand and call forth fiendfyre and burn the entire city of London down. He itched to cast a killing curse. Magic swelled at his fingertips; it was painful. His fingers were black with it.</p><p>If he didn’t release it, he wouldn’t be able to sleep. There was just <em> too </em> much <em> power </em> inside of him.</p><p>It wanted to be let loose.</p><p>He hated it when he got like this. He truly did believe he was insane in these moments. He’d told Abraxas once in sixth year that he thought he was insane. It was a moment of vulnerability that he regretted.</p><p>Abraxas had laughed and said, “But insane people don’t <em> know </em> they’re insane. So you’re fine.”</p><p>Tom didn’t think that was true.</p><p>He rotated his head on his shoulders, cracking the bones, shaking out the tension.</p><p>Perhaps Hermione was right. Perhaps… the dark arts were getting to him.</p><p>He sat on the edge of his bed.</p><p>“Hermione,” he whispered to the thick, tangible darkness. He cast his power outward, releasing the dark magical energy into the air as he always did when he performed intuitive magic. “Come to me. Stop running and come to me.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p align="center"><br/>
<em> <strong>July 26, 1948</strong> </em><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Hermione was crying.</p><p>The guilt was eating her alive again.</p><p>Alphard Black had tried to kiss her, but she’d turned her cheek aside… then escaped quickly into her flat, and left him standing alone outside.</p><p>Why couldn’t she just kiss him? What was <em> wrong </em> with her?</p><p>It would be so damned easy.</p><p>Perhaps she couldn’t be with anybody. That had always been her lot in life.</p><p>A lonely swot. Always outcast. Never completely understood.</p><p>Destined to be alone. </p><p>Hermione gripped the vial of Elixir and tipped it back, letting the flood of happiness sweep her away.</p><p>She couldn’t sleep without it anymore.</p><p>She dreamed that night of a serpent winding itself around her throat.</p><p> </p>

<b> <em>August 6, 1948</em> </b>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Miss Dumbledore, </em>
</p><p>
<em> I hope that this letter finds you well and in the best of health. I have extended many invitations to you now to visit the Manor in the past weeks since I had the pleasure of being your escort to the Ostara Ball. You have most kindly and graciously rejected my every attempt to reconnect, therefore, I have aptly deduced that I have somehow offended you. Please accept my sincerest apologies if I neglected my duties to you as your escort on the night of the Ball. This was indeed a very grave error on my part and one that I have regretted daily since our last meeting. May I be so forward as to say that I have missed your sweet laugh, and your smile? If you will not so much as accept an invitation to visit, I beg you to acquiesce to regular owl correspondence until such a time comes that I may win back your regard.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> That said, I would like to extend one final invitation for you to visit the Manor. If you choose to reject this offer as well, then I will humbly cease to burden you with further invitations in the future. As it stands, in a fortnight, there will be a little get-together of like-minded friends and acquaintances at Malfoy Manor on the night of August 21st at seven o’clock in the evening.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> It would be my immense pleasure if you would attend, Hermione. </em>
</p><p><em> Please RSVP by owl. </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> <em> Affectionately, </em></p><p>
<em> Abraxas Malfoy </em>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p><em> What a finely worded letter, </em> Hermione thought wryly. <em> Even if the poor man seems rather miffed.  </em></p><p>Of course, she was not in the least bit offended at Abraxas Malfoy. She did not, however, intend to run into Tom Riddle at the Malfoy Library, nor did she think that Malfoy was the type of person she wanted to be running with regularly.</p><p>Still, it sounded as if she would greatly offend the fellow if she didn’t accept his invitation. She would have to go, or he would think that she was truly angry at him. </p><p>But how would she get around seeing Tom Riddle?</p><p>She imagined that most of the Death Eaters would be there. Could she possibly invite Alphard Black to escort her? Perhaps he was already invited. She would owl him and ask him immediately. </p><p>Maybe then, with Alphard Black on her arm, Riddle would get the picture and leave her alone. Perhaps, it would keep Abraxas at bay as well. Kill two birds with one stone.</p><p>Besides, it wouldn’t seem too strange for her to show up with Black. Most of Britain’s wizarding population assumed they were a pair anyway. Were they? No, not exactly… But no one needed to know that.</p><p>Hermione sat down at the antique desk in her sitting room and drafted a response for Malfoy, and sent it off with her owl, Perdita. Then, she wrote off a little note for Alphard and saved it to send with the owl later.</p><p>Hermione changed swiftly into a set of black robes that laced up the front and which allowed for swift and fluid movement. It was Sunday, after all, and she would be meeting Dumbledore at Hogwarts for her weekly training session. Hermione had grown rather proficient at bi-casting and dueling occlumency, and was ready to practice casting triple spells. Dumbledore had applauded her progress and magical stamina, and he seemed to be very optimistic that she would be able to learn the difficult technique. </p><p>Their Sundays had evolved from a quick “catch-up” over a cup of tea, to three and even four-hour-long training sessions, followed by dinner in Dumbledore’s office, where they usually laughed and laughed together over the absurdities of Ministry politics. They were each quite relieved to find that the other shared the same feelings and opinions about a great many things. Still, they avoided any topics which might bring up future events. </p><p>Sundays with Dumbledore became a soothing balm for Hermione’s bleeding soul. She hoped he felt the same way. Hermione’s nights were plagued by feelings of guilt, longing, inadequacy, and of severe confusion. She vacillated between taking Dreamless Sleep potion and Elixir of Euphoria each night, unable to rest and seeking escape from her own self-induced psychosis.</p><p>She often dreamed of Tom Riddle. At first, she had sought to escape the dreams that haunted her… but after a few weeks, she came to welcome them, for they were the only place where she could see him, hear him, and touch him. </p><p>Even the dreams gave her guilt.</p><p>Hermione didn’t understand why she ached to see him again, a man whom she’d spoken with only a handful of times, a man she knew would one day transform into a terrifying shell of a person, with a shredded soul, a murderous rage, and an intense hunger for power. </p><p>When her thoughts inevitably wandered to Riddle, she would often remind herself of the sinister voice that had plagued her when she and Harry had shared the horcrux. How it had lied to her and manipulated her, playing on her deepest fears and regrets.</p><p>That was <em> his </em> soul. Tom Riddle’s. That was who he <em> really </em> was.</p><p>She would remind herself of the voice which had demanded Harry be handed over during the Battle. The voice which had mocked Neville Longbottom.</p><p>The evil red eyes.</p><p><em> Be heartless, </em> she commanded herself. <em> Be cruel, like he is. Be cold, be calculating.  </em></p><p>“I cannot fix him,” she whispered to herself. “He’s a murderer. I cannot change someone like that.”</p><p>It became harder and harder to convince herself, each time.</p><p>“I cannot fix him.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>The next week, Hermione stood in front of the construction site for Midas Bank. Magical architects and engineers stood about, and contractors and construction teams, surveyors, and the like littered the site. The senior architect walked Hermione around the site, where workers were currently blasting the dirt and rock to bits with spells, making room in the giant stone basin of the earth for vaults that would be built. </p><p>The team had finally settled on a wizarding community called Kettel Court for the location of the bank, being one of London’s largest magical centres next to Diagon Alley. The building site overlooked the Thames, which sparkled like a bedazzled blue blanket as it flowed beneath the beating sun.</p><p>Hermione stood with Deloris Diggle and Brutus Quintus as they gazed at the busy construction site. Hermione didn’t see an empty, grotesque hole in the ground, spreading out before them like an open wound in the earth, but she saw the finished product, a building of raw purpose and beauty. Modern and sharp, its smooth stone, gleaming metals, and geometric angles would be a perfect frame for the future of the wizarding world. </p><p>Hermione stood on the precipice of the pit below her, gazing down into the raw earth. Around her lay the buzzing beehive of the construction site, but as she looked out at the product of her hard work, she felt only the whiteness of a cave of ice, as if the Thames beyond were the cool waters of the Antarctic, and at once, she knew the glory of a lone explorer.</p><p><em> This </em> is what Hermione desired. Progress, change, and transformation. To <em> pioneer </em> something.</p><p>Hermione finished up her chats with the contractors and then wandered through the connecting streets, exploring the area. She figured she might as well become acquainted with the community since she would be spending a great deal of time here in the coming months.</p><p>As she strode along the Thames, she came upon a large, abandoned factory just a few streets down from the construction site. Intrigued, Hermione walked around the front of the three-story brick building. Vines grew along the sides of the factory, obscuring its old, floor-to-ceiling windows. Hermione could just barely make out the writing on the dilapidated sign, reading “Portsmouth Potions.” It had been an old potion factory. A moth had been painted onto the sign and was charmed to flutter its wings. The moth still beat its wings and Hermione marveled that the charm still lasted on the falling-apart sign. There was something very serene and antiquated about the factory, which had a courtyard in back, fenced in by an old, iron gate. There were dilapidated, rusty machines, vats, and cauldrons scattered throughout the courtyard. </p><p>Hermione instantly fell in love with the building, with its enormity and antiquity. It seemed so cast off and forgotten, lost in the throes of the past, much like herself. She thought to herself that it would be so beautiful if she were to purchase it and fix it up. All it needed was a transformation. It could be something lovely and purposeful once again. </p><p>She wanted to <em> save </em> it. To be the one person who saw value in something once discarded and destroyed, and beyond hope. Something ugly and unwanted.</p><p>“I can fix it,” she whispered.</p><p> </p><hr/><p><br/>

</p><p> </p><p>Hermione’s hands were shaking. She needed an elixir fix. Badly.</p><p>Since when had she <em> needed </em> them?</p><p><em>I’m just nervous,</em> she thought, <em>because</em> <em>I’ll have to see Riddle tonight.</em></p><p>She walked across the room to her potions cabinet and took a vial from the shelf. She caught sight of herself in the mirror. </p><p>Her golden brown hair was partially loose and fell in smooth curls down her back. The upper part of her hair was plaited in braids, wrapped around the back of her head, and tucked out of sight. Loose curls framed her face, and charming art-deco diamond earrings dangled from her ears. A string of pearls hung around her neck, from which hung a sparkling gold serpent pendant, paved with diamonds and inlaid with emeralds for its eyes.</p><p>Alphard had given it to her. She didn’t know exactly what had prompted her to wear this particular piece tonight. She supposed that Alphard Black thought it a symbol of himself, as a Slytherin, but it wasn’t Alphard she thought about when she looked at the serpent.</p><p>Still, he <em> was </em> her escort tonight, so she felt it would please him if she wore it. It reminded her of the dream she’d had last month, of a serpent coiling around her throat.</p><p>She wondered errantly if it would bother Riddle to see another man’s jewelry around her neck.</p><p>Hermione’s gown was pale green-blue, and slightly loose but still fitted to her form. The fabric was a silky sheath over her body, backless and unadorned in the kind of simplistic cut that looked incredibly expensive. It was like a layer of icing over her glowing skin.</p><p>She stared into the mirror and it felt as though the person in the mirror was not herself.</p><p>Perhaps she was not herself anymore. Perhaps she was like the phoenix Ron had given her. Perhaps the old Hermione had died and she was, as Madame Violette had said, being reborn from the ashes.</p><p>Hermione didn't feel reborn. She felt both strong and wilted at the same time. She felt both resilient and depressed... Both hungry and starving.</p><p>What had Madame Violette said? <br/>
<br/>
<em>"Love is the fire of life. It either consumes, or it purifies.’ Will you let it purify you, Hermione? Or, will you be consumed?”</em></p><p>Hermione uncorked the vial of potion and drank it. Relief flooded through her body and happiness settled over her. Her anxiety slipped away.</p><p>A knock sounded on her door. She’d given Alphard the number to dial for the phone booth so that he could come up to her flat to see her more easily. It turns out that Alphard and the entire Black family had indeed, all been invited to the shindig tonight, so she didn’t feel remiss in asking him to be her escort.  He hadn’t intended to go, but since Hermione wanted to attend, he was more than happy to have her on his arm, particularly since he knew Riddle would be there.<br/>
<br/>
She hoped Walburga Black wouldn't attend.</p><p>Her kitten heels clicked on the pale wood floor as she crossed to the door and opened it. </p><p>Alphard Black stood leaning against the wall of the hallway and immediately his eyes took in her appearance, dragging slowly down her form and instantly bringing a bright pink blush rising to her cheeks. He turned his head to the side and lifted an eyebrow before his gaze finally met hers.</p><p>“Well, <em> hello </em> there, Miss Dumbledore.” He held out his hand to her. “It appears that <em> dessert </em> is on the menu, tonight.”</p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes, holding back a smile. She took his hand and he led her out into the hallway, then pulled her into a lingering embrace. He leaned into her and murmured in her ear, “Ready to enter the den of vipers, my dear?”</p><p>She took a deep breath. “Ready as I’ll ever be.”</p><p>He grinned. “You look good enough to eat.”</p><p>“Stop it,” she chided with a bashful smile. “Let’s go.”</p><p>He took her hand and apparated them to the gates of Malfoy Manor.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p>

<em><strong>I Put a Spell on you...<br/>Because you're mine.</strong> </em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The dinner party was like an enormous Slytherin House reunion. There were far more people in attendance than Hermione had originally anticipated. The guest list included many families, The Yaxleys, the Rowles, the Bulstrodes, the Flints and Fawleys, the Crouches and Carrows, and the Abbotts. Then, of course, there were Tom’s Death Eaters: Edward Rosier, Charles Macnair, Orin Mulciber, Ida and Cora Greengrass, Cygnus and Walburga Black, on the arm of Orion Black, Druella Rosier, Maximillian Dolohov, Daegan Rookwood, William Avery, Acacius Nott, and Reinhard Lestrange. </p><p>Not only were <em> they </em> all there, but so were their <em> parents </em>.</p><p>It was a glorified <em> sacred twenty-eight </em> dinner party. Hermione felt nauseous.</p><p>Imagine if they all knew she had mudblood carved into her left arm.</p><p>They’d all piss themselves.</p><p>She was grateful that her spells and glamours had held up well on that arm.</p><p>Hermione felt everyone’s eyes on her as she walked into the drawing room. Alphard had his hand resting casually around her waist as he guided her into the room. They had arrived after the dinner by design, because Hermione didn’t feel like eating dinner with a bunch of Death Eaters. Talk about losing one’s appetite. She could only imagine the topics that had circulated at that table.</p><p>Hermione swallowed nervously; not because of the stares, but because she hadn’t been in this room since Bellatrix Lestrange had tortured her brutally with the cruciatus curse.</p><p>Hermione felt her breathing growing shallow, dizziness threatening to swallow her vision, but thankfully, the euphoria elixir kept her sanity intact. She had another in her beaded bag on her wrist, just in case.</p><p>“Alphard!” Druella Rosier sidled up to the eldest black son, wrapping her arm around his waist in a friendly side hug. “Long time, no see! I’ve missed your witty banter.” She winked at him and he laughed in return.</p><p>“It’s always a pleasure to see you, Dru. Have you met Miss Dumbledore?”</p><p>The younger woman cast a wary glance at Hermione. “I think we may have met at the Ostara Ball back in March. How do you do, Miss Dumbledore?”</p><p>Hermione gave her a genuine smile and bowed her head, then held her hand out and they shook hands. It was a stilted reunion, but not entirely unfriendly. She suspected that Druella was a kind person at heart, but possessed certain loyalties, being the best friend of Walburga Black. </p><p>“I’m delighted to make your reacquaintance, Miss Rosier.”</p><p>Hermione glanced about the room but did not see Tom Riddle.</p><p>She did, however, capture the gaze of her escort’s sister, Walburga. The eldest Black daughter’s blue eyes were iced over and frigid, openly communicating her hatred for Hermione. Hermione smiled back at her, refusing to let the bitch intimidate her.</p><p>Alphard was the perfect buffer for unwanted attention, as well as a pleasant bridge to the other guests, as he guided her painlessly around the room, making introductions and bringing her much-appreciated flutes of champagne.</p><p>“I don’t know what I would do at these things without you, Alphard,” Hermione muttered under her breath. </p><p>His arm tightened around her waist and he turned to her. “Glad to be of service, Hermione.” He said her name with an intimate inflection and a lowering of his voice. Her eyes lifted to his, and she found him gazing at her hungrily, his stare devouring every detail of her face. </p><p>Hermione swallowed.</p><p>She had caught him looking at her like this more and more frequently of late. Her breath caught in her throat.</p><p>Alphard slowly lifted his hand and brushed a lock of her hair from her face, tucking it behind her ear. </p><p>A movement from the corner of her eye drew Hermione’s attention away, and she turned to find Tom Riddle walking into the room, flanked by Abraxas Malfoy and one of the Yaxleys.</p><p>He was staring right at them. His expression was masked, but his eyes were unmistakably dark and sharp. His eyes wandered from Alphard to Hermione, and then fell to the string of pearls around her neck. The serpent charm.</p><p>Abraxas approached them. “Hermione,” he murmured, bowing low and taking her hand in his. He lifted her hand to his lips, bestowing a kiss on her skin. “I’m honored that you chose to join us this evening. It has been far too long to have been deprived of your presence. I hope you will come around more often.” He then turned to Alphard and extended his hand. “Black.”</p><p>The two shook hands stiffly; neither wizard seemed particularly pleased to see the other.</p><p>“Come, Hermione, Black, you do remember meeting Mrs. Tuft? She is currently running for Minister.” Abraxas led them over to a particular grouping of people, including Riddle, the Greengrass sisters, Druella Rosier, the Abbotts, the Flints, and a few other Death Eaters. There, Hermione was reacquainted with the Ministerial candidate.</p><p>“I do recall meeting, at Minister Moon’s dinner party, several months ago,” Hermione said with a smile. “It’s a pleasure to see you again, Mrs. Tuft.”</p><p>The woman gave her a serene smile, but there was no warmth behind it. “And you as well, Miss Dumbledore. One can hardly exist in any social circles these days without hearing your name brought up many times over. I find myself quite curious about the <em> noteworthy </em> Hermione Dumbledore.”</p><p>Hermione couldn’t be sure, but she felt a slight chill in the woman’s words, a deeply buried insult, disguised by a polite smile.</p><p>Before Hermione could answer, Cora Greengrass interjected, “Oh my, but what a beautiful necklace you’re wearing, Hermione! Wherever did you get it?”</p><p>Hermione’s hand automatically lifted to touch the glittering pendant. “Oh, <em> thank </em> you…” She refused to look at Riddle. “It was a gift… from Alphard, actually.”</p><p>She didn’t miss the curious glances that several people cast at the two of them. </p><p>William Avery coughed.</p><p>“Well, it’s very <em> Slytherin </em>,” Cora simpered with a smile. “You have very good taste, Alphard. There’s nothing a witch loves more than diamonds. Wouldn’t you agree, Hermione?”</p><p>Hermione’s eyebrows raised. “Oh, yes, diamonds are lovely.” She sipped from her flute of champagne. “But I think I’d take a rare book over a diamond any day, myself.”</p><p>Laughter filtered through the circle. “Spoken like the true swot that you are, Hermione,” Alphard chuckled warmly. He placed his hand casually around her waist.</p><p>Hermione braved a glance at Riddle where he stood, only feet away.</p><p>His eyes were already on hers.</p><p>Their eyes met in a spark of heat. His flicked downward to where Alphard’s hand rested on her waist, then he looked away coldly.</p><p>“Alphard said you moved into the DuPont flats in the historic district,” Druella Rosier commented. “Have you met the ghost there yet? People say there’s the ghost of a French woman that haunts those apartments.”</p><p>“Oh,” Hermione murmured. “No, I haven’t encountered any ghosts… as of yet.”</p><p>Druella’s voice lowered as if she were saying something very secretive. “Some say she was a seer in her life, and that she can still tell you the future, even from the afterlife.”</p><p>“How fascinating,” Hermione whispered.</p><p>“I’ve a feeling Hermione doesn’t need a <em>ghost</em> to tell her the future,” interjected Riddle. Their eyes met. His were narrowed and searching. Hermione swallowed. How could he know? He couldn’t. Perhaps, he suspected… but he couldn’t know anything with certainty.</p><p>“What do you mean by that, Tom?” Ida Greengrass questioned.</p><p>“Oh, I do believe he’s teasing me,” Hermione said with tinkling laughter. “I’ve always viewed the practice of divination with contempt, but I’ve been dusting off my books on the subject of late. We had a little chat about it, some months ago.”</p><p>Alphard grinned. “Why don’t you practice on me, Hermione? What do you see in my future?”</p><p>“Well, unfortunately, I didn’t bring my crystal ball with me, <em> but… </em> ” There were a few laughs. Hermione made a show of looking at him with a mysterious smile. Then she closed her eyes and held her hands aloft, as if she were consulting the fates. “I foresee… you will purchase many more <em> diamonds </em> in the near future.”</p><p>The entire circle burst into delighted laughter. Alphard chuckled brightly. “I have a feeling you’re right, Hermione. What a <em> gift </em> you possess. I do think you’ve missed your calling.”</p><p>“She certainly should reconsider her career as a columnist,” chuckled Ida.</p><p>She smiled back at Alphard, and then glanced at Riddle. He was holding back a smile. He cocked his head, and his eyes sparked with a challenge.</p><p>Alphard then led her away, and they drifted over to where one of the Carrow daughters was seated at a large, white grand piano. She was playing quite beautifully, and Hermione soaked in the listless ballad; she could feel Riddle’s eyes boring into her back.<br/><br/></p><hr/><p> </p><p>Walburga Black hid in a corner of the room, observing the proceedings in stoic silence. Orion had opted to catch up with his school friends, and she was glad to be free of him for the moment. He despised catching her staring at Tom Riddle, and that was precisely what she intended to do.</p><p>She fingered the Prefect badge in the clutch around her wrist. </p><p>Her eyes followed the dance between Riddle and Hermione all night. Surprisingly, they avoided one another. But one couldn’t help but notice the stares and the heat of their eye contact.</p><p>It made Walburga ill.</p><p>She hated Hermione. She despised her because she was Walburga’s exact opposite. They had not one single thing in common. She did not understand what Riddle saw in the girl.</p><p>It sickened her that her brother wanted her. If the witch ended up in her family, even if by marriage, Walburga would off herself. The thought was simply ghastly. </p><p>No, Walburga would end the girl before that could ever happen.</p><p>She looked up to find Maximillian Dolohov approaching. He sipped from a glass of firewhiskey and leaned against the wall where Walburga stood.</p><p>“Good to see you again, Burgs.”</p><p>“Don’t call me that.”</p><p>“Forgive me, <em> Walburga </em>. What’s got you sulking in the corner?”</p><p>“What do you want, Max?”</p><p>“You know, for someone who just recently got engaged to the <em>love</em> of their <em> life </em>, you’re quite pissy.”</p><p>“I wonder why,” she murmured icily.</p><p>“Ah, yes,” Dolohov drawled, following her line of sight. “I almost forgot. Charming Tom Riddle. Do <em> forgive </em> me.” </p><p>“You are not forgiven, nor will you ever be. Now fuck off.”</p><p>He chuckled. “No, I don’t think I will.”</p><p>She shrugged. “Suit yourself.”</p><p>Dolohov gazed at her, letting his eyes roam her pale skin, soft lips, and the various pleasing peaks and valleys of her body, so appropriately defined by her dark blue gown. “You know, doll, for someone so beautiful, you’re looking a bit peaky these days.”</p><p>Walburga rolled her head on her shoulder to glare at him. “You certainly know how to make a girl feel special.”</p><p>Dolohov narrowed his eyes and then snatched her hand. She tried to pull her hand away from him but he slid up the sleeve of her dress, revealing several fresh cuts on her forearm and the scars of many older ones. She scowled at him and yanked her arm away.</p><p>“I said <em> fuck off </em>, Max. Why can’t you ever take a hint?”</p><p>“You know, Burgs, I’ve already told you this once, but you don’t have to marry the blooming sod. Not Orion, anyway. I don’t think mum and dad would be too down in the mouth if you married a pureblood like myself, from a good family. Forget about Riddle. He’s only a bloody half-blood anyway. Heir of Slytherin means fuck all to me. The Gaunts always were a schizophrenic lot and it's clear the apple doesn’t fall far.”</p><p>“You’d better hope he doesn’t hear you talking like that,” she murmured, cutting her eyes over at him.</p><p>“Why, love? You going to tell him?” </p><p>Walburga rolled her eyes. “I don’t suppose I will. It’s not like loyalty ever got me anywhere with him, anyway.”</p><p>“That’s right. Riddle expects unyielding loyalty... but he's loyal to one person, and one person only. <em> Himself </em>.”</p><p>She scoffed. “And <em> Hermione Dumbledore </em>, apparently.”</p><p>Dolohov’s eyes narrowed. “What do you mean?”</p><p>“Haven’t you heard?” she spat haughtily. “She’s his newest little pursuit.”</p><p>He looked back at Riddle. “I hadn’t noticed that at all.”</p><p>She smirked. “Well, I know him better than all you cuntlickers.”</p><p>Dolohov grinned and looked at Walburga. “<em> Language </em>, princess. Wouldn’t want the gossips to hear you talking like that.”</p><p>She stared at him acidly. “I’m not your <em> princess </em>.”</p><p>He grinned wider. “You <em> are </em> though.”</p><p>Walburga rolled her eyes and sighed, then turned to gaze at Riddle where he chatted with Malfoy across the room. “If you don’t like him, then why do you follow him?”</p><p>He tilted his head back and forth. “Our interests are aligned.”</p><p>“Right. So what do you think of his little pet?”</p><p>“Who? The Dumble-whore?” </p><p>She gave a throaty laugh.<br/><br/>He took a deep breath. “I think she’s no good. She’s a Dumbledore, after all. But she is influential. Or, at least, she’s on her way to becoming influential.”</p><p>Walburga stared daggers at Hermione. “I want her dead, Max.”</p><p>Dolohov was quiet for several minutes. Then he made as if to leave. “If you’re right, and she’s Riddle’s new obsession, then you’d better steer clear, or you’ll surely find yourself at the end of his wand, and that, my dear, is a very dangerous place to be. I may not like him much, but I will say that the bloke has one thing going for him, at least.”</p><p>“And what is that?”</p><p>“He’s completely fucking mental.”</p><p>The pair’s eyes met, and they both burst into laughter.</p><p>"So are you, Max."</p><p>Dolohov grinned and bowed. "Guilty as charged."</p><p> </p><hr/><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Riddle tore his eyes away from Hermione.</p><p>He fingered his wand in his pocket.</p><p>Truthfully, he didn’t want to be here, but he wouldn’t pass up the opportunity to see her. He itched to cast the spell. He wanted to know the truth.</p><p>But he must be patient.</p><p>His entire life felt like one long purgatory of patience, of biding his time. His soul felt as if it were flayed raw from the waiting.</p><p>Hermione was one thing he didn’t want to wait for any longer.</p><p>She stood by the hearth chatting with Elizabeth Abbott. He heard her tinkling laughter and it reminded him of his dreams from months ago. He hadn’t dreamed of her in quite some time. It made him feel farther from her.</p><p>Tom made his way to the bar and asked for a glass of Ogden’s. When he turned back around, there stood Alphard Black.</p><p>Riddle ran his tongue over his top teeth. “How is it that I’m always accosted by you whenever I’m getting a drink?”</p><p>Black chuckled. “I was only getting one for myself, my friend.”</p><p>Riddle’s eyes narrowed, then he started to walk away.</p><p>“Did you hear about my sister’s engagement?”</p><p>Riddle’s spine tensed. He turned around and stared at Black. He took a sip of his firewhiskey. “I did.”</p><p>“I think she missed you being at the engagement party.”</p><p>Riddle’s face was blank. “I sent my congratulations. By owl.”</p><p>Alphard smiled. “Right, so you did.” He grabbed his drink from the bar and turned to look at Riddle. He took a sip and sighed. </p><p>Tom’s stared at the man patiently. “What is that you want to say, Black?”</p><p>He shrugged, then came to stand beside Riddle as they looked out at the crowd. “Nothing much. I just want you to stay out of my way, where Hermione is concerned.”</p><p>Riddle’s jaw tensed. “What makes you think I want her?”</p><p>Alphard laughed. “I know you, my friend. I can see it in your fucking eyes. You’re obsessed with her.”</p><p>Riddle cocked his head. “Do you even like her, Black?”</p><p>“Do <em> you </em>? Are you even capable of such a thing? You think I don’t know better than most what goes on in that sordid head of yours? We were legilimency partners in school, after all.”</p><p>“Yes, and I found myself rather shocked by the <em> lack </em> of what goes on in yours.”</p><p>Alphard chuckled. </p><p>“You didn’t answer my question, Black. Do you even like her?”</p><p>Alphard scowled. “Of course, I like her! What’s there not to fucking like?”</p><p>Riddle nodded, his expression carefully empty. “Right. I think you just want her to get to me. I think you want her because she’s powerful.”</p><p>Alphard shook his head, amused. “Doesn’t sound much like me, now does it? Isn’t that what <em> you </em> want, Tom? Power? That’s <em> you </em>, not me. And if I’m being totally honest, I don’t need a witch to achieve power. I’ve already got it. I was born into it. What were you born into, Tom?”</p><p>Riddle chuckled. “You’ve said it yourself, Black. You’ve got it all. The diamonds, the prestige, the lineage. You’ve got everything a witch would want." He lowered his voice conspiratorially as he met the other's gaze. "So why try to scare me off, Black? Why would <em>I</em> need to stay out of <em>your</em> way? You’ve got it all, and I have nothing. Right?”</p><p>Alphard glared at Tom. “You’re not worthy of her, Tom. You think she wants a wizard who’s as poisoned by dark magic as you are? What are you gonna do, induct her into your little club? Your <em>knights</em>? You think that’s what she wants for her life? You’re a shopboy, Tom. You are nothing. You have nothing. You were born from nothing. You have nothing to offer. She will figure that out sooner or later.”</p><p>Riddle’s face betrayed nothing. He simply stared at his old school rival, and then took another sip of firewhiskey.</p><p>Alphard Black turned on his heel and walked away.</p><p> </p><hr/><p><br/>Walburga's eyes followed Tom Riddle throughout the night. She observed his tall figure, the way his trousers rode on his waist, the way they tightened around his thighs. She noted his particular gait, a quick, purposeful saunter as if he were never quite present in his surroundings. He always seemed to be elsewhere in his mind, somewhere far above everyone. Always thinking about something grander. That's what Walburga loved about Tom. He was a dreamer. <br/><br/>Walburga was no dreamer. She was quite tethered to the present. She was like the center of gravity for her social group. Everything had always revolved around her as if she was the earth, and everyone orbited her. Except that Tom had been the sun in her universe, brightening everything else in her life.</p><p>Now her sun was gone, and everything was bitterly cold.</p><p>When he finished talking to her brother, she noticed that Tom left the room. He had slipped out silently, in such a way that made her think he didn't want it known where he was going.</p><p>Walburga wanted to know. She always wanted to know where Tom was.</p><p>She cast a silencing charm on her feet and slipped into the hallway he had escaped into. She followed a good distance behind.<br/><br/>He made his way out onto the second-floor terrace in the back of the mansion and then made his way down the stone steps to the gardens. </p><p>Walburga stood away from the balustrade, just far enough back so as to be out of sight. She watched him withdraw a muggle cigarette from his pocket and light it.</p><p>Then he leaned against a column and looked out over the gardens, inhaling smoke.</p><p>She wondered what he was thinking. Tom Riddle's thoughts had always been an enigma.</p><p>She used to wonder during the summers when Tom would go back to the orphanage, if he was thinking of her, or if he missed her at all.</p><p>Now she knew that he never had.</p><p>Walburga still touched herself and thought of him. It felt wrong, and yet, it had been such a habit these past few years that she couldn't simply break the practice all at once.<br/><br/>She hoped that when she killed Hermione, Tom would feel the same thing she felt... the aching, barren wasteland of pain.</p><p>But then, she wasn't sure if Tom could feel anything, at all.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Hermione could feel his presence throughout the night, the icy tendrils of his magic like a tether binding her to him, pulling tighter in the long stretches of time that she prevented her eyes from meeting his. It was as though there were a string connecting their souls which pulled taut as they moved farther from each other, and which slackened as they grew closer. She could feel his eyes burning into her back, dragging down her body. She knew the moment his eyes landed on her, and she knew the very moment he looked away, when the shocking coldness faded and the dull warmth of the party returned. Energy crackled between them, taking her breath away each time she found his smoldering gaze upon her, icing her over with a wintery fire, raking over her appearance as if he could undress her there in front of everyone.</p><p>She felt like prey being stalked slowly by a dangerous, vicious predator.</p><p>She smiled casually at Alphard, letting her eyes sparkle like the crystal decanter she drank from, like the glittering serpent she wore around her neck.</p><p>After a few minutes, she scanned the crowd, realizing only when disappointment descended that she was looking for Tom. But he was gone.</p><p>Minutes passed, and someone made a remark addressing Hermione. </p><p>“Forgive me, I tuned out for a moment. What did you say?” Hermione needed an elixir.</p><p>She responded and carried on the conversation for a few more minutes, but her thoughts were elsewhere… she couldn’t help herself. The room, the company, and the air were all beginning to feel rather suffocating. </p><p>“Alphard,” she murmured, laying a hand on his jacket. “I think I’ll run to the library really quick and check on a book I’ve been curious about. I won’t be long…”</p><p>His brow drew forward, and he clearly noticed her preoccupation. “Do you want me to go with you?” </p><p>“Oh, no,” she muttered. “It won’t be very interesting, I’ll just be reading and terribly distracted. Don’t worry, I’ll be back very soon.”</p><p>He nodded, his eyes meeting hers as he leaned in and kissed her cheek. The others standing around marked the gesture, watching with curious stares as Hermione made her way to the double doors which led out of the drawing room. She fully intended to cross the hall and head to the library, desiring more than anything to be alone for a few moments. But when Hermione walked out into the corridor, she suddenly felt an irresistible pull to go in the exact opposite direction, toward the balcony at the end of the hallway. </p><p>Her heels clicked against the pale marble as she walked out onto the terrace, and then turned instinctually to descend the stone steps to the gardens below.</p><p>Sounds reached Hermione’s ears; insects chirped in the darkness, and the marble fountains gushed. There was the indistinct feeling of waiting; it hovered in the air.</p><p>Hermione stood staring out into the moonlit gardens, which were encased in a thick fog that swirled through the hedges and the giant oak trees. Lights glowed in their branches, along the walkways, and within the lampposts. Despite the faint lights and the opalescent radiance of the moon, the gardens felt empty and dark. Solemn. Devoid of something… she just didn’t know what.</p><p>“Are you looking for me?”</p><p>Hermione jumped and spun around to find Riddle leaning against one of the giant pillars of a grand, circular porch that hung off the back of the Manor’s east wing. The silver moon lit his inky black hair as he stood watching her from the shadows.</p><p>She shook her head. “<em> No </em>. I- I was needing a moment… alone.”</p><p>She couldn’t see his face in the darkness.. only the end of his cigarette which blazed red in the shadows.</p><p>“Are you sure?” came his smooth reply.</p><p>Hermione furrowed her brows. She looked around herself in a daze. Now that she thought about it… she couldn’t really explain what had drawn her here, to the gardens. It had been more of an impulse… a feeling which drove her to this place. She’d had every intention of visiting the library but had strangely found herself here instead.</p><p>Her lips parted. “Did you… did you put a spell on me?”</p><p>Riddle pushed away from the stone column, put out his cigarette, and stepped forward into the dim light of the moon. He began to make his way to where she stood. She could feel that same tether she’d felt earlier in the night, pulling taut as he neared, as if his hand was running along it, testing it. Hermione channeled her eyes into serene calmness despite the thundering of her heart in her chest.</p><p>“Yes. I did.” Riddle smirked, and she noticed at once that he had his wand in his left hand. He deftly spun the yew wand between his fingers as he came to stand beside her. “Funny thing about this spell. It's a kind of summoning spell… but it can only draw to me what already <em> belongs </em> to me.”</p><p>Hermione’s back stiffened as he leaned forward and whispered, “Your own magic seems to think you’re mine, Hermione.”</p><p>Fear shot down her spine, and she suddenly took off running. Her heart sped up, adrenaline spiking in her veins. </p><p>She gasped as she heard his footsteps echoing behind her. Hermione cursed her choice of shoes as she tore across the gardens with no destination in mind. She only had the untempered need to flee from Riddle, to get as far away from him as humanly possible. She wanted to scream, but her throat had closed up out of fear, her voice locked up and her breath momentarily frozen in her chest.</p><p>“No!” she gasped as she felt his hand wrap around her wrist in a bruising grip. He spun her about and she slammed against the stone wall of the manor, hidden beneath the shadow of a balustrade. His arms pinned her in on either side and suddenly, his body was warm and hard against hers, preventing any movement.</p><p>“Where do you think you’re going, little witch?”</p><p>His scent washed over her as he snaked a hand around her waist and pressed her harder into the wall behind her. She held up a hand in a meek effort at fortitude but the spell prevented her from struggling.</p><p>“Please, Tom. I came with Alphard. He will be wondering where I am."</p><p>“Then I suggest you stop playing games, and end this little charade of yours.” His icy voice was ever calm, ever smooth darkness.</p><p>“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Hermione gritted out from between her teeth. She dared not look at him, for fear that at any moment her resolution would crumble.</p><p>His jaw tensed as he gazed down at her. She always forgot how <em> tall </em> he was. “Look at me, Hermione,” he commanded gently.</p><p>She shook her head, bucking against his weight as she fought the effects of the spell. Angry tears rose to her eyes. She hated Tom Riddle. She hated how he made her feel. She hated that he would be so <em> bold </em> as to put her under a spell. She hated how dazed she felt under the force of his magic… and she hated that she had thought of him every day of the past two months. </p><p>“Look at me. <em> Now </em>, Hermione.”</p><p>She swallowed, her mind fighting against the eyes that she knew would cause her to cave, but her body betrayed her, unable to refuse the command as her gaze rose slowly. His thumb and forefinger gripped her chin and aided in lifting her face to his. Their eyes met in a spark of flames and ice, a blending of blistering heat and freezing winter.</p><p>“In a moment,” he breathed, his voice commanding in its calmness. “I’m going to take from you what should have already been given to me.” </p><p>Her eyes widened in fear, and she struggled wildly against him, like a rabid animal. </p><p>“You’re completely at my mercy, Hermione. I could perform legilimency on you, but I won’t. I want you to tell me the truth. Everything you’re hiding.”</p><p>With a hoarse sob, she asked, “What do you want from me, Tom?”</p><p>His eyes hardened. “You already know the answer to that, little witch. My patience is growing thin with your lies and your games.”</p><p>“I don’t know-” she murmured breathlessly as she struggled against the haze of the spell. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”</p><p>“Yes, you do.” His lips turned up in the barest hint of a smirk as he ejected a caustic laugh. “You know exactly what I want, Hermione, but you want to hear me say it. Truth be told, for a Gryffindor, you’re quite manipulative. I think you might just be a Slytherin after all.”</p><p>Hermione shivered as she stared at him. Her body felt suddenly very still. She swallowed, and his eyes followed the movement predatorily. Her heart thudded, her pulse jumping in her throat. He was right. Some fucked up and fractured part of her <em> needed </em> him to say it. Desperately. She <em> needed </em> to know if he hated her as much as she hated him. She needed to know if he <em> thought </em> of her as much as she thought of him. She needed him to speak the words <em> out loud </em>.</p><p>Riddle’s eyes roamed her face hungrily in the dim moonlight, his eyes taking in the blur of her features as they adjusted to the darkness… as if he were reacquainting himself with her lips, her eyelashes, the curve of her jaw. After a moment, he slid his hand around the back of her neck, thumb resting against her cheekbone and he pulled her forward. Then his lips brushed the shell of her ear as he muttered, “I’ll tell you exactly what I want, little witch. I want to know who you really are under this facade of yours. I want to know the magic you’re capable of. I want to know the dark, twisted parts of yourself that you try to hide from the world. I want to be the one who draws them out of you.”</p><p>Then he lowered his voice to a whisper, and she shivered, feeling his hot breath against her ear. “And I want to fuck you, Hermione. Slow, and hard.” He shifted his hand and wrapped his fingers around her throat. “I want to control the air you breathe. I want to fill every hole in your body and all the cracks in your soul. I want you to attend your balls and your galas with my cum in your stomach.” He dragged his thumb over her lip. “I want to see it dripping from your pretty lips. I want to drink from you. I want you to scream my name like it hurts. I want you to taste yourself on my lips. I want you to feel sore when you walk into your job to write your petty articles about me. I want to leave a treasure map of bruises all over your fucking body.” With his other hand, Tom lifted his wand and dragged the tip of it from her navel and downward slowly, with torturous intent, until Hermione’s hand finally reached up and snatched at his wrist, pulling it away from her. He smirked at her, his black eyes glittering and sinister. “X marks the spot, Hermione.”</p><p>She swallowed. They stared at one another for several seconds. There were no words necessary because the electric current that sizzled between their gazes needed no explanation. She hated the effect that his speech had on her. She hated the erotic images that his words had conjured. Hermione’s breathing was heavy, and her vision shook with the violent pounding of her heart. </p><p>His eyes bore into her, flickering down to her heaving chest. “I’m going to break the spell, Hermione… and then you’re going to <em> stay put </em>.” </p><p>Tom spun his wand between his fingers and then flicked it. All at once, Hermione felt release wash over her. Tom stood watching her, his body pressed firmly against hers as if waiting to see if she would obey or try to flee. After a moment, when she made no move to leave, he lifted a hand to brush her hair aside, allowing his finger to trail downward, over her collarbone, grazing the swell of her breast and then circling around her nipple over the silky fabric. </p><p>Hermione’s body tensed and grew very still beneath his touch. His fingertip burned everywhere he touched, teasing her sensitive nerves over the fabric of her dress. Her cheeks grew hot, and she hoped he couldn’t see in the darkness.</p><p>His eyes flickered like fire and then smoldered, dragging away from her chest to search her face. “Close your eyes.”</p><p>Hermione’s heart pounded violently. Words failed her, and she shook her head nervously, not a denial, but a plea. He gripped her chin, his mouth tight as he stared at her, his soulless eyes allowing no refusal. “Don’t make me say it again.”</p><p>Her dusky lids felt heavy of a sudden. She felt them flutter shut… as if it were the easiest thing in the world to give in.</p><p>His lips claimed hers, and there was no gentleness in his kiss, only violence and hunger. She felt her body ripped from the wall and pressed tightly against him as his arms encircled her waist, one hand snaking up her back to grip her curls, his fingers tightening in them as his mouth searched hers. Riddle’s tongue parted her lips, invading her mouth in a shockingly intimate way, testing her, pushing her past her limits, and sending lightning through her core. His dark magic swept through her in an electric current that caused a violent shiver, and she let out a soft sound, a plea that made him pull her tighter, every inch of his body hard against hers.</p><p>Alarm spread through Hermione as she realized what was happening, knowing that she could not stop it. The thought came to her of Alphard but it was distant. She placed a hand weakly on Tom’s chest, prepared to push him away, but he gripped her wrist, pulling her hand away before he intertwined his fingers with hers. He pressed her back into the wall, holding her hand pinned above her head against the smooth stone. His mouth left hers, trailing a wet path down her neck and to her collarbone, his perfect teeth grazing her skin.</p><p>Hermione began to feel a pulse between her legs, a hot thrumming as her blood pounded in her veins. The feeling intensified with every second that his hands and mouth moved along her bare skin. Suddenly, his mouth found her breast, his tongue circling her nipple over her dress, the barrier of the fabric causing friction more maddening than direct touch. He sucked her nipple into his mouth then bit down gently, tugging at it with his teeth.</p><p>She gasped for breath, shock mounting as he suddenly pinned her to the stone wall and lifted her dress, giving her no time to protest as his lithe fingers pushed her underwear to the side and slid along her entrance, testing the wetness that coated his fingers.</p><p>He paused, nostrils flaring as he breathed heavily, swallowed, and then, pushed one finger deeper. Hermione’s eyes widened as she felt its roughness inside her. She pressed her face into his shoulder, feeling a nervous fluttering, a raw and unfamiliar mix of emotions. Her clit began to throb, causing her to move against his fingers, her own hunger feeling foreign and strange.</p><p>“You pretend not to want me, Hermione, but your body betrays you. You’re fucking soaked for me,” he muttered.</p><p>He pressed into her, adding another digit, gently moving them deeper as he gauged her reaction. Then, his fingers came up against the barrier inside her and he paused with a narrowing of his eyes. Hermione’s head still rested on his shoulder, and she could see from the corner of her eye that he blinked twice, his jaw tensing and untensing. There had been no time or opportunity to inform him that she had never had sex before. It’s not as if she had <em> planned on </em> this happening tonight. Hermione was too mortified to speak, although she felt she should say something. The moment passed quickly, however, and he, without a word, he leaned down to press his lips once more to her throat, his hunger hotter than ever and focused, calculating, honing in on Hermione as she trembled under his ministrations. He began to pump his fingers in, and then out, shallowly, being careful not to push too far, gently massaging away any discomfort. Hermione’s mouth fell open at the blissful pleasure of it, only heightening when she felt his thumb press against the sensitive area between her legs, circling with a distinct pressure as his fingers moved inside her.</p><p>His hands, <em> his </em> hands. <em> Lord Voldemort’s </em>… the hands that would cast the killing curse that killed her best friend’s parents. Hands that would cause immense pain and torture. Hands she’d thought about more than she liked to admit over the past two months... Those hands were now upon her, inside of her, stroking, pleasuring, solely focused on Hermione in that moment. It was hard to reconcile that monster with the man who touched her now. </p><p>She wanted it… she wanted <em> him </em>… this powerful wizard. His hands, his body, his lips… she desired all of him in that moment, all to herself. </p><p>She gasped as his fingers moved faster, pumping in and out of her quickly, his thumb swirling around her center, causing an ache to build torturously in her core. She wrapped her arms around his neck, pulling herself closer, letting his scent swallow her, wanting his essence to drown her as she began to move her hips against him.</p><p>That action drove him wild… her <em>answering</em> him. The soft begging of her body was like a drug for Tom.</p><p>She felt his breath on her neck and his voice was hoarse in her ear, “Say my name, Hermione.”</p><p>She obeyed, every fiber of her being in submission in that moment, and his name escaped her lips, the burning ache building in her body causing her voice to be laced with passion.</p><p>“Say you’re mine.”</p><p>Her eyes flew open. She hesitated, but he spat a command, “Say it, Hermione. You belong to me.”</p><p>She wanted to argue. She wanted to hit him, to curse him, to prove him wrong… but in that moment, she knew that he wasn’t wrong. She was more <em> his </em> than she’d ever been anyone else’s in her entire life. Tonight only proved it. She bit her lip, feeling shameful and guilty. “I’m yours,” she whispered. Her legs shook as she said it, wetness starting to drip down her thighs. He slowed, but she moved her hips against him, begging for release.</p><p>“Not yet,” he whispered, his voice raspy and thick with lust. “Say you’re mine and not his.”</p><p>Hermione’s breathing was heavy, her mind thrashing against him wildly, but her body begged for more and her lips obeyed, savoring sweet submission and surrender. “I’m yours.” Her eyelids fell closed. “Not his.”</p><p>“Good girl,” he breathed. He withdrew his thumb, replacing it with the heel of his palm as he began to grind against her center; the ache grew more intense as he edged her even closer. His voice was like darkness in her ear, sending a shiver through her body that she felt between her legs as he instructed, “Say you’ll never fuck him.”</p><p>“Tom, please…” she moaned, unable to control herself. She was out of her mind, only focused on the fire in her body, the unfamiliar pounding that grew stronger each second as he controlled her completely. She panted, her breathing ragged and halted as she felt herself about to explode. “Never. I never will.” Her voice came out as a gasp, her breathing strained as she edged toward release.</p><p>Right then, he reached up and gripped the strand of pearls around her throat. With a forceful pull, he yanked them from her neck, and the pearls scattered everywhere, spilling onto the stone and grass. </p><p>He tossed the serpent pendant into the dirt and muttered in her ear, his voice icy, as if he knew that it was his coldness that drove her insane. “Now be a good little witch and moan my name when you finish.”</p><p>He had pushed her to the edge, elicited words from her that she thought she would never say, dragged out of her another woman entirely. </p><p>She felt both shame and euphoria simultaneously… both hot anger and blissful surrender. </p><p>His arm encircled her to hold her steady as her thighs quivered, her legs threatening to give way beneath her. He fingered her furiously, massaging her clit in an expert rhythm as he whispered, “You’re mine, Hermione. Your mouth is mine. Your body is mine. Your soul is mine. Everything is <em> mine </em>.”</p><p>At that moment she collapsed, spine arching back as her body exploded in waves of release. Her mouth fell open and her head fell back, his name escaping her lips in a soft moan. He continued to move his fingers gently inside her as her walls clenched around them, his hand dripping wet. She could feel the warm liquid running down her thighs.</p><p>After a few moments, his hand withdrew. Then she watched, chest heaving as he lifted his fingers to his mouth and sucked the taste of her from them. </p><p>She heard him curse quietly.</p><p>A satisfied numbness spread through Hermione’s body. As often as she’d imagined being with him this way, her fantasies were always accompanied by guilt and self-loathing. But to her immense surprise, there was none of that. She was sure it would come, but in this moment, she felt nothing but serenity. A beautiful peace descended as she lifted her eyes to his face and met his gaze. She found no arrogance, no edge in his eyes, only hot embers and a dark fire that consumed her. </p><p>She leaned against him, totally spent, and he caught her, holding her there in his arms against the stone wall. </p><p>Despite what he’d forced her to admit, and regardless of how much she wanted to hate him… Hermione <em> wanted </em> him.</p><p>She knew that she would hate herself later. All of the guilt would be there soon enough. But in this moment, she allowed herself to want him. </p><p>Her body trembled against his. Hermione felt a million conflicting emotions all at once and the weight of them threatened to crush her. </p><p>After a moment, Tom leaned back and gripped her chin, tilting her face upward as he lowered his mouth to hers. </p><p>This kiss was soft and gentle. His tongue languidly stroked hers, his lips tasting and teasing hers playfully. The moment felt so perfect that Hermione thought she might cry, and she didn’t understand it. She didn’t understand the <em> rightness </em> of it all. </p><p>How could this feel so right and yet be <em>so</em> <em>undeniably</em> and <em>utterly</em> wrong?</p><p>She pulled away. “I- Tom, I have to go.” She straightened her dress and started to walk away shakily, but he pulled her back by her wrist.</p><p>He wrapped his hand around her throat and kissed her again, slowly. Hermione’s head spun at the torturously sinful taste of him, the way his tongue slid sensually against hers, how his mouth snatched at hers hungrily. She had never wanted something so badly in that moment as she wanted Tom Riddle. He kissed her for another minute and Hermione savored the devastating taste of his mouth. After a moment, he tugged on her bottom lip with his teeth before letting her go.</p><p>She walked away from him in the dark. Then she climbed the stone steps that led back up to the terrace and when she got to the top, she turned to look at him one more time. He stood in the gardens beneath the moonlight, a figure unnaturally erect and brimming with preternatural power. He looked so at home in the darkness, as if he belonged there, a creature born of the shadows. Her chest tightened, and she knew suddenly that she had crossed a threshold from which there was no return.</p><p>Hermione slowly left the terrace and walked back into the corridor, making her way back down the wide marble hallway to the drawing room. She stood for a moment outside the massive double doors that led to the drawing-room, steadying her breath and trying to process what had just happened. After a few moments, she began to turn the door handle, but just as she did, she heard a sound.</p><p>She whipped her head around toward the sound, but just as she looked up, Hermione froze.</p><p>There, at the other end of the hallway, stood Walburga Black.</p><p>The witch’s face was twisted with hatred and pain. She looked at Hermione with a venomous expression, and then she smiled.</p><p>“I'm going to end you, Hermione.” Her wand was gripped tightly in her right hand.</p><p>Hermione’s blood ran cold, and she leapt to the side as she quickly pulled her wand out of the holster on her thigh. </p><p>Both witches raised their wands, and with a bright flash of blue and green light, they began to duel.<br/><br/><br/></p>

<em> “He saw her before he saw anything else in the room.” - F. Scott Fitzgerald </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Tom pulled a black and silver case out of his robes. He took a cigarette out of the case and shoved the end between his lips, then lit it with his gold lighter.</p><p>He breathed in the smoke deeply, then exhaled. He could still taste her on his tongue.</p><p>He stood in the gardens beneath the starlight, basking in his victory.</p><p>Not only had his spell worked, but he had also successfully coaxed her into verbal assent. She was <em> his </em>. She’d admitted it, and the submission had fallen so exquisitely from her lips. </p><p>Tom grinned as he thought about Alphard Black. </p><p>‘<em> You’re a shopboy, Tom. You are nothing. You have nothing. </em>’</p><p>He chuckled to himself. “I have <em> her </em> ,” he thought. “I have the support of nearly every pureblood family in Britain. I have my <em> power, </em>the most invaluable thing of all.”</p><p>Perhaps Black was the one who truly had nothing.</p><p>It depended entirely upon perspective.</p><p>She was <em> his </em>.</p><p>Whether she wanted to be or not.</p><p>He recalled the way she’d clung to him, how she’d moved her hips desperately against his hand. He thought of how tight she felt around his fingers. He wished he'd been wearing his ring. The thought of the cold metal of his horcrux being coated in her juices made Tom come unhinged.</p><p>He was still dumbfounded by the fact that she was a virgin. He had not expected it. </p><p>That particular fact titillated him.</p><p>Tom closed his eyes and tilted his head back, breathing the tobacco deeply into his lungs. “Fuck,” he exhaled.</p><p>The entire encounter had turned into much more than he had planned. He was surprised at how easily she’d come apart under his touch.</p><p>For two months he’d bided his time; he had not pursued her. He had not owled, nor attempted to see her.</p><p>So that the moment he touched her, she’d been ready to crumble… and crumble, she did.</p><p>He wanted more than anything to apparate her back to his flat, but he couldn’t. He would have to approach this slowly. With caution. </p><p>She would go back into the gathering. She would leave tonight with Alphard Black.</p><p>He would allow that to happen.</p><p>But she was <em> his </em>.</p><p>That’s all that mattered to Tom.</p><p>He didn’t care whose arm she was on in public. He didn’t care what the papers wrote. He truthfully didn’t even care whose jewelry she wore.</p><p>It was his name on her lips. <em>His</em> fingers made her come undone.</p><p>That was enough for Tom. </p><p>For <em> now </em>.</p><p>Of course, there were her secrets. Another obstacle to deal with. Perhaps, he didn’t <em> need </em> to uncover them. Perhaps, if she trusted him enough, she would reveal them herself.</p><p>Tom turned and gazed up at the balcony where she had disappeared. He took another long drag from his cigarette, savoring the blending of tobacco with the sweet and metallic taste of her. </p><p>Then, he cocked his head. There was a flash of green light, then blue which lit up the entrance to the hallway beyond the terrace. A moment later, he saw a flash of red. His brow furrowed, then his eyes narrowed. Another flash of blue.</p><p>Tom threw his cigarette on the ground and took off running. He withdrew his wand from his pocket as he bounded up the stone steps leading to the balcony. He turned on his heel and wheeled into the hallway just in time to see Hermione lobbing a curse at the hallway’s chandelier. It broke free and he heard a woman’s scream as it fell to the marble floor with a resounding crash. The myriad of glass pendants shattered and their shards projected, scattering across the floor and shooting through the air. Tom threw up his shield, effectively blocking the fragments.</p><p>When the glass splinters stopped spraying across the room, Tom caught sight of Hermione and Walburga Black in the midst of a vicious exchange of spells and curses. Voices and shouts could be heard and suddenly the doors to the drawing room opened and the remaining guests filtered into the hallway at their own risk, watching in shock as the curses flew back and forth between their wands.</p><p>Tom stood at the end of the hallway, several feet behind Hermione, observing as the two women dueled in a volley of lights bursting back and forth between them. The colorful curses and spells shot across the room at lightning speed. </p><p>“Walburga, stop!” shouted Alphard, followed by shouts from Orion and Druella, but the witch was caught in a trance of fury. Her sights were set on Hermione and Hermione alone.</p><p>Walburga sent an enormous spinning wheel of fire hurling toward Hermione. Tom started forward instinctually, but he stopped short when Hermione conjured a wall of water, using a spell he assumed was a variation of <em> Aguamenti </em>, which dissolved the fireball immediately. The wall then fell with a splash, bathing Hermione, Tom, and several other guests standing nearby. Tom shook the water from his eyes and it dripped from the tips of his hair. </p><p>“<em> Oppugno </em>!” Hermione shouted, and suddenly the shards of glass from the shattered chandelier coagulated and rose into the air, coming to a point in the air like a sinister javelin and shot directly toward Walburga. The witch screamed and threw up her shield, but not before some of the shards pricked her skin. Trickles of blood ran down her throat, cheeks, and arms. </p><p>She glared at Hermione with unbridled hatred. “<em> Serpensortia tribulus </em>!”</p><p>From the tip of her wand, three large black snakes shot immediately toward Hermione’s face, their jaws wide and fangs bared. </p><p>Hermione hit one of the serpents midair with an <em> expulso </em> curse, sending it flying back into the wall of the corridor. She dodged quickly to the left and evaded the remaining two, both of which fell to the floor and began to slither across the floor with alarming speed, two black vipers zigzagging across the floor toward Hermione. </p><p>Tom considered calling them away using Parseltongue, but as soon as the thought crossed his mind, Hermione held out her wand in one hand and spread the other out wide as she commanded, “<em> Confringo </em> !” At once, one of the serpents was hit with a red burst of light from her wand and immediately was consumed by an explosion of flames. To Tom’s surprise, the other serpent simultaneously <em> vanished </em> into thin air.</p><p>Riddle’s eyes narrowed, confusion twisting his expression. Did <em> she </em> vanish the snake? She could have possibly used <em> vipera evanesca </em> wandlessly, but how was it possible that she had vanished <em> and </em> exploded both snakes <em> at the exact same time </em>?</p><p>Tom wanted to intervene, but he was far too curious now. </p><p>Alphard now had his wand drawn, and it was clear he was determining whether he should intervene. </p><p>Tom observed Hermione’s stance, noting that it was impeccable, her footwork surprisingly precise. He watched as she advanced and then fell back, deftly sidestepping and ducking Walburga’s curses. Tom found it rather pleasurable to watch her; he noted that his witch had an elegant method of dueling that almost gave the impression of a dance, light on her feet, and always anticipating the older witch’s next move. </p><p>Walburga was casting an alarming number of spells at Hermione, and Tom watched as Hermione’s blue shield dissolved each spell easily. Whatever curses she didn’t shield, she evaded with expert vigilance. </p><p>It made no sense for a homeschooled witch of only 19 years of age, to fight with this much skill and precision.</p><p>He definitely believed that she had dueled dark wizards before. The kind of exactness that her movements exuded could only be gained through experience and not training alone.</p><p>It only whet his appetite to discover what she was hiding from him. It was painfully obvious now that her story just didn’t add up. Alphard Black caught Tom’s eye and he imagined that Black was thinking the exact same thing.</p><p>As the two witches faced off with one another at opposite ends of the corridor, Tom realized that Hermione was casting significantly fewer spells than Walburga. He thrilled as he realized she was waiting her out, allowing Walburga to drain her magical stores while Hermione danced around the bolts of light gracefully. While the older witch was throwing out a barrage of spells, in a very emotional display of dueling, Hermione cast only a few, and more than a few of her spells hit their mark.</p><p>“<em> Diffindo </em>!” Hermione caught Walburga’s shoulder with a slicing hex. Then, subsequently, hit her wand hand with a stinging jinx.</p><p>Walburga’s shriek of anger echoed throughout the corridor.</p><p>“<em> Bombarda!” </em> shouted the witch in an explosion of anger. Her curse hit a marble statue near Hermione, exploding the object viciously. Hermione, with a grunt, fell to her knees and promptly shielded herself from the falling shrapnel.</p><p>“<em> Oppugno </em>!” shouted Hermione, and suddenly the jagged shards of marble began to fly at Walburga, pelting her relentlessly before she could shield herself from them. Tom smirked as he mentally filed it away that she was rather fond of that spell.</p><p>Walburga was breathless now and it was clear to see that she was becoming somewhat magically drained, but the look in her eyes said that she wouldn’t stop until she’d either killed Hermione or been grievously injured herself. </p><p>Tom watched with rapt attention. He’d been curious about his witch’s magic since the day they met, and upon seeing her obvious skill, he decided wouldn’t cut short this opportunity to observe her fighting style and magical potency. If he thought she was in any real danger, he would certainly intervene, but it was clear that despite the obvious advantages the older witch had, she was greatly outmatched by Hermione. </p><p>Hermione fought more creatively, outwitting the older witch, draining her, provoking her, and drawing her skillfully into what appeared to be a well-laid trap.</p><p>Tom hadn’t thought it was possible to be more attracted to the witch, but he had clearly been mistaken.</p><p>Again, he was beset by the urge to apparate her back to his flat.</p><p>After all, their encounter in the gardens had only sharpened his lust.</p><p>Hermione was a priceless gem that had waltzed into his life, setting fire to every thought and dream he had ever erected.</p><p>Tom grinned to himself as he watched her fight. His black eyes shone like obsidian. He reveled in the thought that Hermione had absolutely <em> no idea </em>just yet that she had become his most intense obsession.</p><p>As the two women dueled, there came nervous gasps, screams, and shouts from the other guests in the hallway, but Tom barely heard them.</p><p>There was nothing but ringing in his ears and a burning in his chest, and he saw only Hermione.</p><p>Tom cast his magic toward her, willing its energy to aid her. <em> Win, Hermione, </em> he thought. <em> Destroy her, little witch. </em></p><p>Walburga and Hermione paused for a moment. The older witch glared at her, her chest heaving as blood bloomed from the cut on her shoulder.</p><p>“<em>Avada Kedavra</em>!” The green bolt of light erupted from the witch’s wand, and Tom instinctually lurched forward toward Hermione. He hadn’t meant to intervene, but his body carried him forth unintentionally, sudden panic gripping his chest. </p><p>But he stopped in his tracks. Hermione had not only blocked Walburga’s curse, but she’d had cast her own spell simultaneously.</p><p>She had <em> shielded </em> and <em> cast </em> in the same instant.</p><p>Tom’s eyes narrowed. How did she <em> do </em> that?</p><p>He stood rooted to the marble floor. His panic had instantly shifted to arousal.</p><p>Alphard shouted angrily as his sister cast the killing curse toward Hermione, and he ran toward her with his wand drawn, but she immediately stunned him.</p><p>Tom chuckled at the sight of the bastard on the floor.</p><p>Walburga was clearly weakened. Hermione’s deterioration hex had landed, and Walburga stood shocked by the show of magical prowess Hermione had just displayed. Though drained and severely impaired, Walburga shot another curse at Hermione.</p><p>“<em> Crucio </em>!” The red spell erupted from her wand weakly, but Hermione once again blocked it with the shield charm which poured out of her wand.</p><p>As the blue shield flared from Hermione’s wand, she released two more curses simultaneously. A flash of purple burst from her fingertips, and another white light exploded toward Walburga as she shouted, “<em> Sectumsempra </em>!”</p><p>A <em> shield </em> , and <em> two curses </em>, all at once.</p><p><em> Fucking hell, </em> thought Tom.</p><p>Tom was sufficiently impressed; that, in and of itself, was no easy feat.</p><p>Walburga had enough presence of mind to block Hermione’s full-body bind, but she froze as the second curse hit its mark. </p><p>The dark curse slashed through her chest and stomach in sanguinary cuts, exposing flesh and bone. Blood immediately poured from the ghastly wounds, and Walburga stared down at herself in shock. After a moment, she fell to her knees, and no one moved. </p><p>The hallway was frozen in terror.</p><p>“Expelliarmus!” Hermione shouted, then she deftly caught the witch’s wand in her left hand.</p><p>Then Hermione rushed forward with no small amount of hysteria as she took in what she’d done. Her hands were shaking violently. </p><p>Alphard Black ran toward Walburga, catching her in his arms as she lost consciousness.</p><p>“Walburga!” he exclaimed frantically.</p><p>“Lay her down,” Hermione urged, her voice shrill. She, herself, had been hit by a few hexes and had a number of small cuts and bruises on her face and arms, likely from the explosions of glass and marble.</p><p>Tom suddenly strode forward and leaned over Hermione, taking hold of her arm gently. “Hermione, she tried to kill you. Let Alphard take care of her.”</p><p>Alphard glared at Tom.</p><p>“No… <em> no </em> !” Hermione sobbed, tears now springing forward. “I can fix it, I- I know the counter-curse… <em> Merlin </em> … <em> S-Sirius… </em> no, no, she <em> cannot </em> die! I’m <em> so </em> sorry... Alphard, I <em> can </em> fix it!”</p><p>Tom gazed at her with furrowed brows, confused by her rambling as she ran her wand slowly over each cut, muttering the incantation, “<em> Vulnera Sanentur.” </em></p><p>Walburga’s breathing was shallow. Hermione cast <em> scourgify </em> to rid her chest of the blood.</p><p>“Hang on, Walburga, you’ll be fine. I promise.” Hermione’s hands were trembling terribly, impeding her ability to cast.</p><p>After a moment, she reached and unclipped her beaded bag from the bracelet on her wrist, engorged it and then reached inside, producing a small vial of potion. She drank the entire potion and began to cast again. Within seconds, her hands had steadied significantly, which Tom did not fail to notice.</p><p>The mending of each cut was slow work. No one spoke. There was only the sound of Druella weeping.</p><p>Orion Black had rushed to Walburga’s side, but no one questioned Hermione as she muttered <em> ‘vulnera sanentur’ </em>over and over, dragging her wand painstakingly over the severe wounds. </p><p>“Who started the duel, Hermione?” Alphard whispered.</p><p>Hermione sighed and kept working. “Walburga.”</p><p>He nodded. “I assumed so.”</p><p>When the wounds were closed, she reached into her bag, producing a small vial of Essence of Dittany, which she then began to drop over the wounds. </p><p>“Orion,” Hermione called out. He knelt beside her. “Spread the dittany over her wounds. She should be fine, the dittany will ease the scarring and the pain.”</p><p>Druella Rosier ran over with tears in her eyes, trying to revive Walburga.  Hermione reached into her bag again and produced another vial. </p><p>“Give her this when she wakes… it’s a blood-replenishing potion. Give her a bit, then rennervate her.” Hermione handed it to Druella.</p><p>Tom stood gazing down at them with eyes narrowed and lips parted. <em> Why </em> did this witch carry dittany, elixirs, and blood-replenishing potions casually in a bag round her wrist? To a <em> dinner party </em>?</p><p>
<em> What the fuck? </em>
</p><p>And <em>where </em>did she learn that curse? He’d never heard of it before, and he was sure he knew of almost every dark curse in existence.</p><p>When Hermione stood, she was inadvertently facing Riddle. He gazed at her as if he were seeing her for the first time. </p><p>Their eyes met, and Tom’s were brimming with questions. He cocked a brow at her. She looked away quickly.</p><p>Riddle wanted to take her with him, but he allowed Alphard Black to lead her away.<br/>
<br/>
The Blacks had become a thorn in Tom’s side.</p><p>He would deal with them all soon enough.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Alphard had immediately apparated to Hermione’s flat to escort her to the door. He seemed rather concerned for her welfare; Hermione appreciated it, considering his sister was wounded and at St. Mungo’s currently. He really should be there with her, but chose to see Hermione home first.</p><p>They stood outside the door to her flat.</p><p>“Are you alright, Hermione?” He brushed his fingertips over a cut on her temple.</p><p>She nodded. She was ready for this night to be over with. It felt like ages ago, and not a few hours when Alphard had first picked her up at her door. She desperately needed rest after the events of the night.</p><p>Alphard laid a hand on her shoulder and ran his palm along her skin. “Listen, I’m really sorry about my sister. What she did was completely out of line. I know you have every right to press charges and have her chucked in Azkaban, but… I’d appreciate it if you’d let me handle Walburga.”</p><p>Hermione nodded. She couldn’t very well have her sent to Azkaban anyway, even if she had wanted to. Then she wouldn’t marry Orion, and Sirius wouldn’t be born. Everything had to stay the <em> same </em>. “Of course, Alphard. Of course, I won’t press charges.”</p><p>“Thank you, Hermione. Rest assured, she <em> will </em> be dealt with.” He smiled. “Besides, it’s not like to you didn’t already hand her arse to her tonight.”</p><p>Hermione laughed weakly. “I suppose I did, didn’t I? I didn’t mean to hurt her so badly, though. I’ve never used that curse before. I don’t think I <em> ever </em> will again.”</p><p>“She deserved it. Although I will say, that was some pretty skillful dueling. I think everyone was rather dumbstruck.”</p><p>Hermione said nothing. The fact that everyone had seen her use the tri-casting technique that Dumbledore had shown her, did make her a bit nervous. She didn’t want to appear threatening. She didn’t need anyone asking questions about her. </p><p>Alphard’s eyes locked with hers. “You disappeared for quite a while tonight.”</p><p>Hermione froze. </p><p>When she didn’t respond, he asked, “Were you with Riddle?”</p><p>Her lips parted, and her heart began to beat violently. “I was, Alphard. I’m sorry.”</p><p>His eyebrows lifted and he averted his eyes and looked at the door. The hurt on his face was apparent.</p><p>Her heart fractured. “I’m so sorry about everything, Alphard. I don’t really know what to say about tonight.”</p><p>He gazed at her very soberly, and she knew what was coming. “Hermione…”</p><p>“I know, Alphard. I understand. I’m a fool. I understand if you don’t want to see me anymore. I wouldn’t want to see me either. Just… <em> please </em> don’t hate me.”</p><p>He laughed. “Wait, Hermione. That isn’t <em> at all </em> what I was going to say.”</p><p>Hermione’s brows furrowed, confusion tinting her expression.</p><p>He leaned his hand against the wall by her door and he sighed. “Listen, Hermione. I just need to say a few things. I don’t blame you for what happened with my sister tonight. Not at all. Walburga’s been.. Well, for a grown woman, she’s been acting like a spoiled child. I’m sorry that I didn’t make an effort to prevent this, and I just want to make sure some things are very clear. You do realize <em> why </em> Walburga hates you, don’t you?”</p><p>Hermione looked at Alphard sideways. “Well… I thought it was <em> primarily </em> because of my articles… My blood purity beliefs.”</p><p>Alphard shook his head. “I know you have something going on with Riddle, Hermione. I can see it when he looks at you.” He paused when he saw the distress on her face. “Look, I’m not upset about it, Hermione. Well… I mean, I <em> am </em> ,” he laughed. “But… I know it isn't your fault. He’s a good-looking guy, and he’s charming, and all of that, but… you don’t <em> really </em> know him. Every girl in that drawing room tonight has had a crush on Tom Riddle at some point or other. He has a way about him that makes women crazy.”</p><p>Hermione scoffed and rolled her eyes. “Yes, I know your sister has feelings for him. I know that’s partly why she hates me.”</p><p>He raised an eyebrow. “Do you know <em> why </em> she has feelings for him?”</p><p>Hermione froze. After a moment, she spoke haltingly. “I- don’t…”</p><p>He smiled wryly. “Yeah. I figured you didn’t know. Walburga and Riddle had a… relationship, of sorts. I don’t really know the whole arrangement, but let’s just say it was <em> carnal </em>, in nature. It went on for about… I don’t know, about six years.”</p><p>Hermione’s eyes grew very wide. “Six… <em> years </em>? They were…”</p><p>He nodded reluctantly. “Shagging? Yea. Even though my sister was <em> supposed </em> to be betrothed to my cousin… she was determined that it was going to be Tom Riddle who married her, in the end. You couldn’t talk her out of it.”</p><p>Hermione felt like ice water had been dumped over her. “I <em> see </em> . So… er- when did this… <em> relationship </em> end?”</p><p>He met her gaze. “A few months ago.”</p><p>Hermione swallowed. “<em> Oh </em>.”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>Hermione was quiet. </p><p>“Look… I probably should’ve told you already, but I assumed you already knew. Then I saw him looking at you, and I saw you look at him, and I thought… I thought maybe you <em> didn’t </em> know. Turns out, I was right.”</p><p>Hermione didn’t know what to say.</p><p>Her body went completely numb.</p><p>She felt like a terrible person for the way she had treated Alphard.</p><p>“I’m so sorry, Alphard. I feel terrible.”</p><p>He shook his head, then stepped forward to take hold of her chin. “Hey, Dumbledore. Listen. I know the effect he can have on girls. I saw it all through school. I just want you to… maybe, take a step back and re-evaluate what you <em> think </em> you feel for him. Because… I do really care about you. I just don’t think you’ve really given us a chance. I think if Riddle weren’t in the way, things would be different. I wish they were. I think you do, too.”</p><p>Hermione nodded, swallowing. “I do.”</p><p>“Good.” Alphard Black leaned forward. His expression was conflicted. He lifted his hand and brushed his knuckles across her cheek, then dropped it away. “Can I see you this week?”</p><p>Hermione’s eyebrows shot up. “You… still <em> want </em> to see me? After-”</p><p>He fought back a smile. His eyes were both warm and pained as they gazed back at her. “Yeah. I do. But <em> only </em> if you promise to let me kiss you. I think it’s time we overcame that little obstacle. Don’t you?”</p><p>Her eyes widened. A deep red blush spread across her cheeks. “<em> Oh </em>. Um...”</p><p>He leaned forward with a lopsided smile. “Just say <em> yes </em>. It’s not hard.”</p><p>Hermione gazed back at him and a slow smile spread across her face. “Okay...” He raised his eyebrows expectantly and she laughed. “<em> Yes </em>!”</p><p>Alphard grinned. “There you go. I’ll come to get you this Thursday evening.”<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p>Walburga lay in her bed at Grimmauld Place, running her fingers over the grotesque scars on her chest. Alphard had just left, but only after a severe scolding. He’d called her a child. Said she could’ve ended up in Azkaban for the curse she’d cast. Told her she was lucky to be alive; lucky that <em> Hermione </em> had healed her after.</p><p>Walburga wasn’t grateful. It made her hate the witch even more. She wished the cunt had just let her die.</p><p>Now she was confined to her room indefinitely. Alphard had told her parents about the duel, and suggested they bring a mind healer for Walburga. Now she had to see the mind healer every week. </p><p>Tom had watched her get schooled by the younger witch. Walburga couldn’t believe it; the girl had cast three spells all at once. Walburga might’ve been impressed if she didn’t harbor such hatred in her heart. She hadn’t understood what Riddle saw in the girl, but perhaps there was much more to her than Walburga had previously thought.</p><p>She felt bile rising in her throat. Nausea. Complete and utter despair. </p><p>It was only just sinking in that she had lied to herself for years.</p><p>She had convinced herself that Riddle wanted her. What boy would continually keep coming back to the same girl for six years? He hadn’t slept with anyone else. The other Slytherin boys made the rounds; it had been almost a contest to see who could fuck the most witches in each house. But Tom had been immune to those contests. He faithfully chose Walburga, and she’d been sure it was because he wanted her. That he, underneath his cold facade and scathing insults, truly cared for her.</p><p>Now, she knew he’d merely chosen her for her loyalty. She’d submitted without question to his every whim and desire. No matter how depraved or degrading. She even allowed him to obliviate her at times. Sometimes, she wanted to be obliviated.</p><p>He’d rarely kissed her. Kissing almost seemed distasteful to him. She lied to herself; told herself it was because he didn’t enjoy it. His tastes were quite singular, after all. He wasn’t interested in romantic gestures. He craved violence, and she wanted to give him what he wanted. If she wanted release, she had to beg him; shed tears. He reveled in his total control over her.</p><p>That is why he’d chosen her. Because she submitted to him completely. She presented no challenges.</p><p>That was likely, ironically, the reason he <em> didn’t </em> want her.</p><p>She imagined he wanted Hermione because she <em> challenged </em> him.</p><p>Walburga couldn’t believe how badly she had fucked herself over.</p><p>She had always felt some sort of triumph that she had been able to keep his interest for so many years. Now, she felt manipulated. Somehow, he had made her <em> crave </em> his acceptance. He’d smugly watched her debase herself for him, taking pleasure in the lengths she’d go to to please him. He’d <em> used </em> her. The whole while, she’d been convinced he would eventually marry her. She imagined what she would say to her parents when she broke her betrothal. She had imagined Tom one day becoming Minister for Magic. That would be a balm to soothe her angry parents. Everyone at Hogwarts talked about it. How he’d teach DADA and then eventually run for Minister. No one had any doubts that he would succeed. He was so charismatic, so accomplished. Tom Riddle could do anything he set his mind to.</p><p>Then, he’d made the rather odd and disappointing choice to become a shopboy at Borgin &amp; Burkes. His teachers all mourned his choice. His Knights of Walpurgis were shocked. Not only that, but he <em> turned down </em> countless offers to work for the Ministry. </p><p>Then, he started to see Walburga less and less. When he did, he was distracted. He finished and then left quickly.</p><p>Walburga started to see her dreams with Tom slowly go up in smoke.</p><p>He became more cruel. His Death Eaters began to fear him. They began to talk about his magical abilities with reverence. He was accomplishing feats of magic that only Dumbledore had ever achieved.</p><p>They spoke of Lord Voldemort.</p><p>They began to talk of revolt, and revolution.</p><p>She was secretly glad her brother had never joined their ranks.</p><p>Walburga laughed bitterly as she gazed at the scars on her arm. <em> Now </em>, she had scars. Real ones. Hermione Dumbledore had marked her permanently. </p><p>Walburga felt nauseous. She’d seen it with her own eyes.</p><p>She’d seen him chasing her. She’d watched them together, their bodies melded together in the shadows of the balustrade. </p><p>Walburga wasn’t close enough to hear their exchange, but the moment he’d lowered his lips onto hers, Walburga knew. He’d kissed Hermione hungrily, <em> passionately </em>. </p><p>Something he’d never done with Walburga. Not by choice, anyway.</p><p>Her vision was clouded with red. She’d retreated back into the hallway, shattered and broken inside. She couldn’t watch anymore.</p><p>Walburga didn’t care that Hermione had won the battle…</p><p>…because she would win the <em> war </em>.</p><p>Hermione Dumbledore would be dead one day. It might be a year, or two years, or ten years. Walburga would need help; she would need to be wise and strategic. Not rash and emotional.</p><p>But Walburga would never let her live to possess everything <em> she </em> had dreamed of for her life.</p><p>Revenge was the only dream Walburga had left.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p> </p><p>Hermione lay on the floor of her flat, spread out on an elaborate, costly Persian rug. Her palms were facing down, each of her fingers spread wide and gripping the floor like a gecko, and she stared at the ceiling as she had for the past hour. Several tears had been shed already, but thankfully, the Elixir she’d just taken washed away all feelings of guilt and self-loathing. </p><p>How utterly foolish she had been… What on earth had she been thinking? She’d let Tom Riddle… no, <em> Lord Voldemort </em>, lure her into a trap at the dinner party like a handsome, charming acromantula coaxing her into his web.</p><p>What did he want from her? What was his game? </p><p>He was using her… manipulating her. He had to be.</p><p>Manipulation was his strong suit, after all.</p><p>Was it because she was the daughter of Albus Dumbledore? Was he trying to get inside her head so he could turn her attention from her goals? He had to be aware that she was gaining some level of political power. Is that what he wanted - to influence her?</p><p>She dwelled on the events of that night. Tom had been so <em> fixated </em> on her words. He wanted her to admit she was <em> his </em>. He’d commanded her to say it more than once.</p><p>And like a bloody idiot, she had. Like some innocent, lovesick <em> twit </em>. How he must be laughing at her!</p><p>Perhaps he thought he could control her. He had another thing coming if he thought that. Hermione would <em> never </em> allow any man to control her.</p><p>She needed to keep her wits about her the next time she saw Riddle. </p><p>She thought about Alphard’s revelation. </p><p>Riddle had been sleeping with Walburga Black for <em> six years </em>.</p><p>Six <em> bloody </em> years.</p><p>Merlin’s left nut, how <em>stupid</em> she'd been!</p><p>“I’m a fucking idiot,” Hermione whispered to the air, shaking her head in disbelief. </p><p>What did he see in Walburga Black? She supposed it was quite typical of him. Walburga was the perfect little Slytherin harlot, after all. Beautiful. Wealthy. Pureblooded. </p><p>And <em> nothing </em> like Hermione at all.</p><p>Obviously, there was something about the witch that had kept his interest for six years.</p><p>They looked nothing alike. They were almost exact opposites in every way.</p><p>Walburga was curvy and well-endowed, with shiny dark hair that fell to her waist in luxurious curls. Her skin was pale and luminous, with pouty lips and wide blue eyes framed by thick dark lashes. An exotic beauty, by most standards.</p><p>Hermione was thinner all over, with smaller breasts and skin that tanned easily. She had frizzy hair most of the time and she’d always hated that her eyes were a dull brown. Her features were finer, more subtle. She had never made it a habit of comparing herself with other witches, but the knowledge of their former relationship seemed to cast a spotlight on the glaringly obvious differences between them.</p><p>Hermione was not an insecure girl, not by any means. Viktor Krum had found her beautiful. He’d told her so. So had Ron, and Cormac. Still, she found it impossible not to feel somewhat disheartened by the information. Even though she knew she shouldn’t be.</p><p>She shouldn’t care if Tom Riddle found her attractive. Alphard Black clearly did. Riddle’s opinion should mean absolutely nothing to her.</p><p>Hermione’s mind wandered. The room was darkening as the sun went down.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps sex meant very little to Riddle. Hermione couldn’t imagine sleeping with someone she had no emotional attachment to, but she knew that wasn’t the same for everyone.</p><p>Walburga was a <em> nasty </em> person…</p><p>… and Riddle had <em> fucked </em> her. Countless times, no doubt.</p><p>It made Hermione sick to her stomach. Her chest tightened painfully. She hadn’t been able to rid herself of the lump in her throat since Alphard had told her.</p><p>Hermione had never had sex with anyone before… and she’d let Riddle in. Tom Riddle, of <em> all </em> people. She’d practically invited the enemy in for tea and handed him her wand.</p><p>She imagined the scene between them the night of the dinner party, but instead of herself, she saw him with Walburga. She saw his lips on hers, his fingers between her legs.</p><p>Hermione felt she might vomit.</p><p>She closed her eyes. Her lips parted as she tried to breathe steadily. </p><p>It had been the kiss with Riddle which had prevented her from kissing Alphard Black.</p><p>But not anymore. She wouldn’t let her fascination with Tom Riddle get in the way of her career or her love life anymore.</p><p>She wouldn’t give him the satisfaction of holding any power over her.</p><p>The image rose to her mind unbidden of Tom and Walburga, their bodies melting together as he thrust into her. A tear escaped from the corner of Hermione’s eye.</p><p>She angrily swiped at it with her fingers.</p><p>What in <em> Merlin’s name </em> was wrong with her?</p><p>She had no reason to be so emotionally overwrought by this man. She barely knew him!</p><p>No, that wasn’t true. She knew him <em> very </em> well. She knew who he was <em> at his core </em> , and who he would one day become. She’d <em> apparently </em> forgotten that very valuable bit of information. She had a mission that she’d all but aborted. To kill him and destroy his horcruxes. </p><p>She kept picturing Tom with Walburga. She allowed it to fuel her anger, her hatred of him. Hermione used it as a tool to keep her head clear. </p><p>She would see Alphard this Thursday, and when she did, she would kiss him. Then, Tom Riddle’s spell over her would be broken.</p><p>“You can have him, Walburga,” she whispered venomously. “He’s all yours.”</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>It had been three days since he’d seen Hermione at Malfoy Manor. Tom was sitting in his flat, reading the evening edition of <em> The Daily Prophet </em>and smoking a cigarette; his cup of coffee sat on the little wooden side table. Tom had a long night ahead of him to research tracing spells, so he would need the extra caffeine. </p><p>His flat was quite sparse; devoid of decorations, which he would have deemed frivolous, if he had given it any thought at all. But his thoughts weren’t on his surroundings; they were elsewhere. There was a little sofa and side table, a bookshelf filled with books rather haphazardly organized, an enchanted floor lamp with a green glass shade, and a little wooden dining table. He only thought of furniture in terms of necessity. He found that he needed a place to sit, so he bought a sofa. There was no place to set his coffee, so he bought a side table. Of course, there had to be a place to store his books, so he purchased a black wooden bookshelf. Everything had a purpose; practicality and efficiency were all that occurred to Tom. If there had been paintings or knick-knacks lying around, it would have irritated him. He would have wondered what their <em> purpose </em> was, and come to the conclusion that there <em> was none </em>. He thought only of magic and of power, and how one might leverage one to achieve the other. The only thing in his flat he had given any thought to was the green glass lamp he’d purchased for himself at Borgin &amp; Burkes the day he got the job. He was partial to it because its green effervescence reminded him of the dim, watery glow of the Slytherin common room in the Hogwarts dungeons. There were green lamps there, too. Even the torches on the stone walls bore green fire. At times, he missed those dungeons. They felt like home to Tom.</p><p>He took a drag from the cigarette; he was becoming a little too fond of them. He wondered if they were truly bad for him, as Hermione had said.</p><p>Well, if it was indeed a tiny little paper stick made by muggles that did him in, he’d just come back in another body through one of his horcruxes.</p><p>He had thought about owling Hermione, but Tom had never been one to owl much. He didn’t like writing; he preferred speaking in person. His gift of persuasion and his intuitive ability to read people was much more useful in person. It was more difficult to read people on paper. They had more time to react, to formulate a response. He didn’t like to allow anyone that time. Knee-jerk reactions were the easiest way to gain valuable information.</p><p>He wanted information from Hermione. The more he thought about her, the more questions he had.</p><p>Tom wanted to know what she had been thinking since their little encounter. Why was she <em> so </em> opposed to him? Why had she <em> run </em> from him? This was another reason in the slew of reasons that he knew she was hiding something. Why did she so warmly welcome the attentions of other wizards, but seem to resist his so vehemently?</p><p>… and where did she learn that <em> dark curse </em>?</p><p>When did she learn to duel like that? Her stance, her footwork… it had all been immaculate.</p><p>Where had she learned to cast multiple spells simultaneously?</p><p>Why did she carry potions and elixirs that were only found in hospital wards with her to a dinner party?</p><p>Why had she been so concerned about Walburga?</p><p>Why did she sometimes seem to be so <em> afraid </em> of Tom? She had run from him in the garden; her heart was racing in pure terror, so violently that Tom had been able to feel it pounding against his chest as he pinned her to the stone wall.</p><p>His suspicions and questions were like an incessant itch.</p><p>His frustration with her was growing at an alarming rate. Not only were his questions driving him to insanity, but his lust had spiked disturbingly since that night. It was like a film replaying over and over in his mind. He thought about how she’d trembled in his arms, how she had acquiesced so willingly to his commands, the way she had looked when she came, her head thrown back, her lips parted, chest flushed… his name had fallen from her lips with a soft cry. The more Tom thought about it, the more torturous it became. The entire encounter was such a contrast from the bold and fiery witch he knew her to be… it made it that much more enticing for Tom to see her so soft and submissive… and <em> hungry </em>. It was imprinted on his mind… the way she’d pulled him closer, how she'd moved her hips against him, her body begging him for more. He wondered how many other sides of her he would see. It made him want to fuck her a thousand different ways, so he could see every facet of this fascinating witch. Did the witch have claws? Would she fight him if she was angry? </p><p>Tom wanted to find out. He wanted to see her <em> riled </em>.</p><p>Every time he pictured her in the duel with Walburga, his cock hardened painfully. He saw her ducking and sidestepping curses. He saw her casting three spells at once… then, the deep gashes from Hermione’s dark curse slashing through the flesh of Walburga’s chest followed by the grotesque gushing of blood.</p><p>It had been simply divine to see.</p><p>Tom gritted his teeth as he adjusted himself in his trousers.</p><p>She hadn’t been emotional at all during the duel with Walburga. She had been surprisingly calm and composed, which caused Tom to suspect she’d been in dangerous situations many times before. Any other witch he knew would be under duress in that situation. For someone who’d had a killing curse thrown directly at her face, Hermione had been suspiciously clear-headed and able to think quickly on her feet.</p><p>So many theories went through Tom’s head. He’d even wondered if she were an unspeakable… or perhaps an operative of the Ministry? That would explain why Dumbledore went along with the charade. Perhaps, she wasn’t Dumbledore’s daughter after all. That would also explain why the Ministry records on her were so immaculate. </p><p>But it didn’t explain her behavior toward Tom. Her fear and apparent dislike of him. Had Dumbledore warned her against him? He’d thought that was the case from the beginning, but he couldn’t be sure.</p><p>Then… there was his theory about the <em> Tempaestus </em> . It was entirely possible that Hermione had come from the future. But then, how did she end up with his <em> Tempaestus </em>? And why would Dumbledore go along with the whole thing? Why would he claim a witch as his daughter when she wasn’t? There was no way she’d performed memory charms on the old wizard... Nothing made sense.</p><p>Every theory he had was imperfect.</p><p>Tom felt his mind going in circles trying to uncover her secrets and it was driving him mad.</p><p>He’d decided against using legilimency on her. He wanted her to <em> tell him </em>. </p><p>Although…. provided she wouldn’t tell him, he <em> did </em> have a last resort. A plan to outwit her. But he didn’t want to use it yet. He wanted to bring her to her knees first.</p><p>Gods, he needed to <em> fuck </em> her.</p><p>What was Hermione thinking now? It had been nearly three days. She was likely expecting him to owl first.</p><p>No, he wouldn’t owl. He would find her and speak with her tomorrow.</p><p>He wanted to see her face and gauge her reaction.</p><p>He needed to get his business with her wrapped up because he was planning another trip to Albania. A longer one.</p><p>He needed to seal the deal with Hermione once and for all. She was driving him to absolute distraction, and that wouldn’t do.</p><p>With that course of action decided, Tom made his way over to his bookshelf and picked a crisp, new book off the shelf. Its spine cracked pleasantly as he opened it.</p><p>“Now,” he smirked, rolling his neck. “Tracing spells…”</p><p> </p><hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Hermione stood in front of the window in front of her desk at <em> The Daily Prophet </em>, packing up her research material. The paper had just run an article on Walburga’s engagement to Orion Black, and Hermione had decided to subsequently write an article on the dangers of inbreeding. It was her own little slap in the face to Walburga, which she felt was justified, considering the witch had tried to kill her point blank. She muttered a little apology to Sirius because she hoped the article would sufficiently embarrass the entire Black tribe.</p><p>Alphard would just have to forgive her. </p><p>Speaking of which, she had to get home and change, because she was going out with Alphard that night to a wizarding club called <em>The Ley Line</em>. It was difficult to get into, as it was known for famous wizarding musicians and dancing. Tonight, the club would feature Madame Bletchley along with a popular wizarding swing band called the <em>Swedish Seers</em>. Hermione had chosen the perfect red swing dress and pumps, which she would pick up from Madam Malkin’s after work, and she was excited because Alphard had promised to show her the dance steps. She only hoped she wouldn’t trample his feet over much.</p><p>Hermione shrunk her books and parchments and hid them away in her beaded bag, then clipped it back onto the bracelet on her wrist. Then, she made her way down the elevator and walked through the front door into Diagon Alley. </p><p>As she was passing by Slug and Jigger’s Apothecary on her way to Madam Malkin’s, she felt a hand wrap around her wrist and suddenly she was being yanked into a narrow side alley and held against a brick wall by a remarkably strong set of hands. </p><p>She struggled, immediately grappling for her wand, but as she looked up to see who the offender was, she found none other than Tom Riddle looking down at her.</p><p>“You’re not very aware of your surroundings, little witch.” He stood gazing at her with barely concealed amusement.</p><p>She fixed him with a scathing look. “Do you make it a habit of accosting helpless witches in the street?"</p><p>His eyes narrowed and he smiled. “Oh, you’re far from helpless, Hermione. On the contrary, your magical skill is <em> quite </em> impressive. It seems you’ve been holding out on me.”</p><p>She feigned relief. “So I’ve impressed you? Oh, thank <em> Merlin </em> ! I can live out the rest of my life in peace knowing I’ve impressed the great Tom Riddle.” She looked down at where his hands held her shoulders. “You <em> can </em> let go of me now.”</p><p>Riddle smirked and released her. “You’re quite cheeky for a witch who was moaning my name two nights ago.”</p><p>Hermione’s cheeks flushed bright red, but she lifted her chin a notch, setting her jaw. “Yes, well, <em> that </em> was a momentary lapse of judgment that shall not <em> ever </em> be repeated.”</p><p>He grinned, taking a step closer. “Is that so? Would you like me to test that?”</p><p>Hermione backed away and hit the wall again, withdrawing her wand. “Do not touch me, Riddle. I’m warning you.”</p><p>He chuckled. “Do you think I would pass up the chance to duel you, Hermione?” He whipped his wand out of his pocket and she watched him twirl the sinister-looking and ridiculously long white wand between his fingers. He grinned. “How about a wager? If I win, then I fuck you.” </p><p>She scowled at him acidly. “Why would you need to duel me when you have your whore to do to it for you?"</p><p>Tom cocked his head, eyes narrowing. "You weren’t so chilly toward me the other night. What changed?”</p><p>She refused to meet his stare. “You had me under a spell, remember?”</p><p>His jaw tensed. “I broke the spell, Hermione. You weren’t forced into anything.”</p><p>“You said that it was a summoning spell, but that’s not what it was.”</p><p>He shook his head. “No. I said it was a <em> kind </em> of summoning spell.”</p><p>“What was it, then?”</p><p>He smirked. “It was a spell I found in a book called <em> Witchery for the Wicked </em> . I found it in the restricted section at Hogwarts in fifth year. The spell is called the <em> Prison of Desire </em>. It causes you to give in to your basest impulses. Whatever you desire most in a moment, you will not be able to fight against. What you wanted most that night was to find me, and so you did. Then, you became frightened of me, so your impulse was to run, and you did so without a second thought. Then, when I told you what I wanted, there was nothing you desired more than to give in, and so you weren’t able to fight me. You did put up a valiant effort, though.” He grinned with his brilliantly perfect teeth and the effect was devastating. “Of course, I broke the spell before you had the opportunity to embarrass yourself too much.” </p><p>He didn’t need to tell her that it wasn’t the <em> only </em> spell he’d cast, because it was irrelevant. He’d broken both of them at once.</p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes and shrugged. “It doesn’t matter, either way. It was a mistake and it won’t happen again.”</p><p>Tom’s expression grew cold. “<em>Was</em> it, now?”</p><p>She didn’t respond. They stood glaring at one another as the tension grew painfully thick. </p><p>Tom blinked. “Where did you learn to duel like that, Hermione?”</p><p>She gave him an icy smile. “I told you. I’ve fought dark wizards.”</p><p>His eyes narrowed and he took a step forward. “I’m quite interested to hear the details. Why would a homeschooled teenager be fighting dark wizards?”</p><p>This time, her eyes narrowed. “It’s become rather a hobby of mine. There’s nothing I love more than hunting down and destroying dark lords with tainted and… <em> fractured </em> souls.”</p><p>Tom’s eyes flared and hardened. His gaze was like a dagger, sharp and piercing. He was silent for several seconds as he searched her face. She felt his magic brushing up against her mental walls, but she locked them down tight.</p><p>His jaw muscles rippled. “Where did you come from, Hermione? Tell me the truth.”</p><p>Hermione stepped forward and placed her hand on Riddle’s cheek, giving it a soft slap. “That’s for me to know… and for you, to <em> never </em> find out.”</p><p>He scowled and his hand reached up and snatched her wrist in a bruising grip. “I will find out, Hermione. That is an absolute promise. But I would rather you tell me.”</p><p>She swallowed, and then whispered, “I will never tell you anything. It’s none of your business. My life is none of your concern.”</p><p>He smiled and then leaned down until he was on her level. “I think we both know I have a way of getting you to admit things that you’d rather not.” His smile then spread into a grin.</p><p>She ripped her wrist from his grip. “I have to go.”</p><p>His gaze sharpened. “What’s so pressing?”</p><p>She looked at him haughtily and took a deep breath. “If you <em> must </em> know… I have a date. With Alphard Black.”</p><p>Riddle stared at her blankly, schooling his features into a smooth mask. “Very well, I hope you two lovebirds have fun. Just not <em>too</em> <em>much</em> fun.”</p><p>She had already started to walk away but froze when he said it. Hermione whipped around. “What’s that supposed to mean?”</p><p>He cocked an eyebrow. “Have you forgotten already? We both know you’re a liar, Hermione, but do you <em> also </em> break your promises? See, you told me you’d <em> never </em> fuck him. So just in case you’ve forgotten that little vow, I’ll make it easy for you to keep it.” He approached her and leaned down, lifting her face with a knuckle beneath her chin. “If you sleep with Black, I’ll kill him… and I’ll take great pleasure in it.”</p><p>Her eyes narrowed and she scowled, pulling her chin away. “Do you always kill people when they inconvenience you?”</p><p>His black eyes gleamed dangerously. “No. Sometimes I feed them to giants.”</p><p>She smiled innocently. “Or perhaps your pet snake?”</p><p>His laughter faded and he cocked his head. “What did you just say?”</p><p>She said nothing but stared back at him, her lips fighting a coy smile, and her eyes sparkling with laughter.</p><p>He gazed at her for a moment before his eyes fell to her lips, then her throat, then slid down to linger on her chest. Hermione swallowed as memories of that night suddenly came rushing back. His eyes snapped back up to meet hers, and her lips parted at the instant tension that sparked between them.</p><p>He leaned in dangerously close. “You welcome Black so easily into your life… but you’ve fought me since the day we met. <em> Why </em>? Is it because I frighten you?” He brought his face so close that she could feel his breath on her cheek. His intoxicating scent hit her nostrils all at once. He whispered, ”Do you like to be frightened, Hermione?” He laid his hand at the base of her throat. “Do you like how your pulse races when I touch you?”</p><p>Her warm brown eyes met his black ones. People were passing by the opening to the alley as they walked along the street, but neither of them noticed.</p><p>“Why <em> are </em> you afraid of me, Hermione? What is it that you’re hiding?”</p><p>“I have to go,” she whispered as she turned from him and quickly walked away.</p><p>Tom let her go.</p><p>He stood staring at the brick wall where she’d stood as her footsteps echoed on the cobblestone, the sound drifting further and further away.<br/>

<p> </p><p>Hermione’s laughter echoed down the hallway that led to the door of her flat.</p><p>“Oh my goodness,” she said breathlessly as she stumbled out of the elevator with Alphard Black. “I have not been so <em> exhausted </em> , or breathless, or <em> tipsy </em> in quite some time.”</p><p>Alphard laughed and presently grabbed her arm to hold her steady. “I think you may have had one too many sprite spritzers at the bar.”</p><p>“They’re dangerous! They sneak up on you.”</p><p>He chuckled as he led her down the hallway to her door. “<em> Apparently </em>, they do.”</p><p>She feigned offense. “Are you <em> mocking </em> me?”</p><p>He grinned in a brilliant show of teeth. She thought to herself that his smile almost rivaled Riddle’s. “In the most respectful and adoring way, yes. I most certainly am.”</p><p>She shook her head, appalled. “Shocking.”</p><p>She leaned back against the door to her flat. Her eyes were somewhat glazed. They’d danced and danced until her feet ached. “I’m rather proud of myself. I only stepped on your feet a total of six times.”</p><p>He fought back a smile as he leaned over her, placing his hand on the door beside her. “I think you're graciously fudging that number in your favor, my dear.”</p><p>“You mock me incessantly. It’s a wonder I still see you.”</p><p>He grinned. “Why do you, then?”</p><p>Her gaze slipped down to his chest and she gripped his tie absently. “I don’t know. Perhaps, I find you charming.”</p><p>His eyes met hers, his blue eye churning like a storm at sea. His darker grey eye smouldered like a burning coal. “May I come in, Hermione?”</p><p>She gazed at him, her eyes sparkling mysteriously. “You may.” She reached down and placed her hand on the doorknob. The door sprang open at her touch and Hermione fell back instantly. Alphard’s hand shot out and grabbed her just in time and held her up as she laughed uproariously. </p><p>“You are a perilous and ridiculous drunk, Dumbledore.”</p><p>“Keeps you on your toes,” she sang as she crossed through the foyer of her flat, taking off her shoes as she went. “My feet are aching like an old woman’s. I shall be informing Madam Malkin of the impracticality of these pumps when it comes to dancing.”</p><p>“Allow me, then.” Alphard suddenly grabbed her hand turned her around, then pressed her against the wall. His hand slid down her waist and made its way down her leg slowly, then circled her ankle and lifted her foot. He promptly began massaging her delicate foot while his eyes burned into hers.</p><p>Hermione rubbed her lips together and let out a throaty moan at the pleasure of his hands working her aching feet. His nostrils flared at the sound. “You’d make a fine house elf, Alphard.”</p><p>He fought back a smile, laughing under his breath. “I’m sure you’d love nothing better than for me to wait on you hand and foot.”</p><p>“I think it’s a divine idea.”</p><p>“Oh really?” he asked, his voice thick with innuendo. “Would you like me on my knees, Dumbledore?”</p><p>Her smile faded somewhat and his eyes caught hers. Her lips parted, drawing his gaze. His thumb caressed her ankle slowly for a moment before he released it, allowing her to drop her bare foot back to the cool hardwood floor. Then, he lifted his hand and took her chin between his thumb and forefinger, lifting her face to his. He gazed down at her for a moment, then leaned down and pressed his lips to hers.</p><p>His lips were soft and wet as they moved hesitantly against hers. He kissed her differently than Riddle. The action was softer and gentler, testing her as if she were a frigid snowflake that might melt. Perhaps she was. She felt bitterly cold compared to him. Alphard was all warmth and smiles and jokes. She placed a hand on his chest and inhaled. His lips parted and she felt his tongue slide against her lips, so she parted them to allow him entry.</p><p>He turned his head, deepening the kiss. She met his tongue with hers, causing him to suck in a sharp breath through his nose. Hermione enjoyed kissing him, but there was a dull ache in her body that said, <em>wrong.</em> <em>Wrong</em>. She instantly thought of Tom’s hands. She saw them clearly, his black and gold ring on his index finger, the veins that prominently ran up along his wrist and forearm. She suddenly had the overwhelming urge to suck on the finger which bore his ring.</p><p><em> Merlin, I’m more drunk than I realize </em>, she thought.</p><p>She tamped down on her wayward thoughts and lifted a hand to Alphard’s face and slid it upward, letting her fingers thread in his hair. His hand stroked the small of her back. She suddenly felt Tom’s fingers in her hair, snatching her head back… his lips on her throat.</p><p><em> Stop it! </em>she chided herself.</p><p>She wanted this. She <em> wanted </em> Alphard’s lips. She wanted Alphard’s <em> hands </em>.</p><p>Why couldn’t she get Riddle out of her mind?</p><p>The thought occurred to her that perhaps Riddle had placed another spell on her, but she knew instantly that wasn’t the case.</p><p>Riddle was like a strong drug in her system that would have to be purged. It would take time for his effect to leach out of her for good.</p><p>She would simply replace it with Alphard, as any good addict would. It was a desirable trade, after all.</p><p>But would Tom really kill him if she slept with him?</p><p>Did she even want to sleep with him?</p><p>She wasn’t sure.</p><p>Alphard pressed his hips to hers and pulled her closer with his hand around her waist. Then, he released his breath all at once and pulled away. “You taste as good as you smell, Dumbledore,” he murmured.</p><p>She gave him a small smile. Her hand lifted and she ran her thumb over his bottom lip. “Why did you stop?”</p><p>He smiled back and winked. “Don’t want to get ahead of myself. Besides, you’re positively blitzed at the moment.”</p><p>She chuckled. “I hope it hasn’t impaired my kissing over much.”</p><p>His eyes roamed her face. “I wouldn’t call it impaired, by any stretch.”</p><p>She gazed back at him. They simply stared at one another for several moments. </p><p>Then he spoke. “Your eyes are the color of firewhiskey, Hermione. They have the same effect on me as well, I’m afraid.”</p><p>“As firewhiskey?” she asked, surprised by his statement.</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>“Then I guess we’re both sloshed.” She laughed, feeling a sudden need to lighten the mood.</p><p>“I expect another date. Soon.”</p><p>She gave him a coy smile, her eyebrows lifted. “And you shall have it.”</p><p>He nodded. “Good.” He leaned down and kissed her cheek, letting his lips linger on her skin for a moment before he withdrew. “Goodnight, Dumbledore.”</p><p>“Goodnight, Alphard.”</p><p><br/>

<br/>
</p><p>Tom entered through the glass doors of a small muggle cafe. The building was old and historic, located in a rather busy and wealthy part of London. Tom’s shoes echoed loudly across the dark hardwood floors. He approached a round table in the corner which faced a window, looking out over the street.</p><p>There, a woman sat alone, wearing a charming cream-colored three-piece suit, the skirt of which hit just above her knees, revealing contrasting tights stretched over her thin, but shapely legs. Her hat had a little net that covered one eye fashionably.</p><p>“Well, hello, Mr. Riddle.”</p><p>“Mrs. Tuft.”</p><p>Riddle took a seat across from her. He wore a black pinstriped suit. His tie was black and tucked into a dark vest over a crisp white shirt. The chain of his pocket watch dangled from where it was attached.</p><p>“I want to thank you for meeting me today. At a muggle cafe, no less,” came the woman’s smooth, musical voice.</p><p>“I assume that’s by design.”</p><p>“Yes, of course. There are too many itching ears in the wizarding world. Here, the muggles are… blissfully unaware. I do appreciate you meeting me all the same.”</p><p>“The pleasure is all mine. To what do I owe this honor?”</p><p>A young muggle waitress came by and took their order. Wilhelmina Tuft ordered a breakfast tea with cream and sugar. Tom ordered coffee.</p><p>Wilhelmina looked at Tom knowingly. “Well, it seems I can’t go many places in London society without hearing the name of a promising young man by the name of Riddle.”</p><p>“I’m rather shocked to hear that.”</p><p>“Are you?”</p><p>His eyes met hers. “I’m a shopboy, Mrs. Tuft.”</p><p>She stared at him. Her expression bore a hint of amusement; she didn’t believe for one moment that he was merely a shopboy. “If I didn’t know any better, Mr. Riddle, I’d think you were trying to… what’s the phrase? ‘Fly under the radar?’”</p><p>He gazed back at her, his expression unreadable. A blank mask. She continued, “One doesn’t graduate head boy, prefect, all Outstandings, with awards and honors, and <em> highly </em> recommended by both his peers <em> and </em> his educators… to work at a wares shop. What is your goal, Mr. Riddle?”</p><p>The waitress brought his coffee and her tea and sat them down on a silver tray. Tom went ahead and paid for both orders in muggle money. “You may call me Tom if you like.”</p><p>She smiled disarmingly. “I prefer Riddle.”</p><p>He inclined his head. “Suit yourself.”</p><p>She chewed on her inner lip. “That’s not your name, though, is it? That’s not what they call you.”</p><p>Riddle didn’t look at her. He took a sip of his coffee, then set the mug on the table. Then he crossed his ankle over his knee, reached into his inner coat pocket, and produced a cigarette case. Then, he looked at her. “You don’t mind, do you?”</p><p>She shook her head imperceptibly. “Not at all.”</p><p>Riddle put the cigarette between his lips and struck a match. He inhaled deeply and then held the cigarette in his hand, resting it on his ankle. Then, he looked at her. He did not respond to her last comment but waited for her to continue. When she didn’t, he muttered, “What can I do for you, Mrs. Tuft?”</p><p>She cleared her throat, then sipped her tea. “You do know that I’ve been groomed to be the next Minister for Magic. It’s already been decided. I will be Minister within months.”</p><p>He nodded silently. </p><p>She gazed at him. “I possess certain political views and beliefs, which are rather unpopular these days amongst the general public. We have just emerged from the war, not only in the wizarding world but in the muggle world as well. Many are hoping that we will enter a time of peace. Minister Moon assures me that my time as Minister will be one of peace and not wartime. What do you foresee for the future?”</p><p>Tom took another drag. “I am many things, Mrs. Tuft, but I am not a seer.”</p><p>She smiled and her eyes pierced his. “Let me rephrase, then. What are your hopes… for the future?”</p><p>He gazed at her. She had intelligent blue eyes and a rather pleasing voice. She had nice legs, dark hair, great skin, and a pretty face, for her age. She was both classy and sensual, plain, and pretty, all at once. Riddle did find her attractive, for a woman ten years his senior. </p><p>She looked at him like she wanted him to bend her over and rail her over her dining room table. Riddle was quite familiar with the look.</p><p>He might’ve considered it before a certain witch entered his life. But as it stood, his interests were rather singular of late. </p><p>He sat looking at her for a moment, then leaned forward. “You say you have certain political views and beliefs. Then, you ask me what I desire for the future. Well, that’s quite a loaded question, and one I’m not prepared to answer at the present time. See, you’re the politician here. You speak in niceties and hints. I, on the other hand, am not a politician. Nor do I desire to be. I’m a very direct man. Why don’t you tell me what it is that you want from me?”</p><p>She chuckled under her breath at this speech. Then she took a deep breath. “In certain circles in wizarding society, I make mention of my views, my hopes, my <em> dreams </em> for the future. Almost everywhere I go, one name seems to crop up quite consistently alongside those dreams… <em> Riddle </em>. I have a feeling our interests may be aligned. Of course, if you were to ask anyone on the street, they would tell you I’m all for the people. I love muggles. I love magic. I’m… middle of the road, you might say. But I do hope to pave the way during my administration for certain movements to take place. Revolution is what I dream of. I’d like to earn your trust. I’m seeking for powerful and influential friends to build working relationships with.”</p><p>He blinked. “And you’ve somehow come to the conclusion that a shopboy is powerful and influential?”</p><p>She smirked coyly. “I do my research, Mr. Riddle. Besides, look at the way you carry yourself. I’m the next Minister for Magic, and yet you do not seem impressed in the least. I think you know that you have something very valuable to offer me. But your demeanor doesn’t fool me. You <em> know </em> that I have something <em> very </em> valuable to offer you, in return.” </p><p>His lips turned up slightly. “Mrs. Tuft, if you hope to earn my trust, then you’ve already made your first mistake. My trust can’t be earned, because I don’t trust anyone. However, if you want something from me, you’ll have to speak plainly to me now. I know what it is you’re saying, but I frankly don’t care for politicians, and I’d like to know if you’re capable of dropping the mask.”</p><p>She tilted her head. “Very well. I’m sympathetic to the cause of a certain dark wizard. No, I don’t support him. I never have. I always knew he would end up as he has. But… there are aspects of his cause that resonate with me.”</p><p>Riddle exhaled a puff of smoke. “Let’s be clear. Are you referring to blood purity standards, or to the Statute of Secrecy?”</p><p>She smiled at him. “Both.”</p><p>Riddle leaned back, throwing an arm casually over the back of his seat. “Right. Now that we’ve established that… what does this have to do with me?”</p><p>She lifted an eyebrow. “You want me to speak plainly? Then I shall. You are powerful, Mr. Riddle. You have the ear and the loyalty of the youngest members of Britain’s pureblood society. The wealthiest and the oldest families. They say you are a magical force to rival Dumbledore. I find that hard to believe, as young as you are, but I’m sure you’ve achieved <em> something </em> to warrant that reputation. There are positions that I will have to fill as Minister. I’m already aware that you have rejected offers to work for the Ministry. I am also aware that you’ve applied for the DADA position at Hogwarts. However, I think there’s something that you might find… more appealing. Are you aware that Vicência Santos is nearing the end of her term as Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards? She is stepping down. I will be asked to submit candidates for the election. I should think it would be beneficial to both of us if the head of the organization were an ally. Dumbledore has already refused, as you know. He has refused every offer of power or position. There should be someone of his caliber to take his place.”</p><p>He slid the cigarette between his lips and inhaled. He gazed at her as he ejected the smoke. “You want to groom me to be your puppet Mugwump, is that it?”</p><p>She smiled warmly. “On the contrary, Riddle. I want you to be my ally. As you’re probably aware, Supreme Mugwump has a great deal more power than Minister for Magic.”</p><p>“No, they don’t,” he muttered. “Their roles are just different.”</p><p>“Depends on how you look at it.”</p><p>His eyes met hers. “I only have one way of looking at anything, Mrs. Tuft.”</p><p>She gazed back at him searchingly. “I can see that you’re a very decisive individual.”</p><p>He laughed under his breath. “There’s a difference in decisiveness and conviction. Decisiveness makes for a good politician. Conviction makes for a great leader.”</p><p>“And which are you, Mr. Riddle?”</p><p>He smirked and took another drag from his almost-depleted cigarette. “Oh, I’m a shopboy, Mrs. Tuft.”</p><p>She chuckled, then let her eyes slip from his face and down to his chest and hands, for the barest hint of second. Her pupils flared slightly.</p><p>“Do you always check out your political <em> allies </em>?”</p><p>Her eyes froze for a moment, then smoothed back over instantaneously. “I’m married, sir.”</p><p>His lips turned upward and his obsidian eyes flicked to hers. “Right.”</p><p>He was rather impressed with her as a politician. He could probably convince himself to fuck her, but as a person, he decided he disliked her greatly.</p><p>However, he would <em> not </em> fuck her, because he planned to fuck Hermione Dumbledore; and he <em> did </em> like her as a person, very much so. He liked her <em> too </em> much, unfortunately.</p><p>“So,” he began, “if I were to say I were interested, theoretically, in your proposal, what are your terms?”</p><p>She thought for a moment as she sipped her tea. “Well, I have heard from some of your acquaintances that you had intended to leave and travel for a while. I’m not sure how long <em> a while </em> is… but you would need to be here in Britain for the foreseeable future. If you do indeed plan to travel, then there really is no point in discussing it further.”</p><p>Tom put out his cigarette. “I had planned to travel for a few years, once I wrapped up some <em> business </em> here in London… but recently my plans had a bit of wrench thrown in them.” A feisty, petite, frizzy-haired wrench.</p><p>“So you intend to stay in London, then?”</p><p>He nodded once. “I do.”</p><p>“Perfect.” She smiled congenially. She had the kind of face that one instantly trusted. A face that was both open and mysterious all at once. The kind of face that could hide atrocities behind a kind smile with very little effort at all.</p><p>Riddle could recognize this because his face was exactly the same kind.</p><p>“You know I have terms of my own, right?”</p><p>Her eyes met his. “What would those be?”</p><p>He gazed back at her coldly. “I’m not your fucking puppet. I do what I want when I want, and how I want. If you fit in with my plans, and our interests are aligned, perhaps then we can work together.”</p><p>Her eyes were just as icy as she returned his stare. “Understood, Mr. Riddle.”</p><p>“As I’ve said, I only have one way of looking at things. I don’t work for the Ministry. The Ministry serves me. I also don’t plan on following in the footsteps of Grindelwald. That’s a surefire way to end up in Azkaban.”</p><p>“But,” she hedged. “You <em> do </em> have goals.”</p><p>He nodded. “I do.”</p><p>She sipped her tea primly. “You’re a wizard of vision. Or so I’m told.”</p><p>“Very good.” He stood up abruptly and took his suit coat from the back of the chair. “Please excuse me, Mrs. Tuft. I have somewhere to be. The owlery, specifically.”</p><p>Her eyes met his and there was a question in them. “I’d like to keep this conversation going. Will you keep owl correspondence with me regularly?”</p><p>He stood gazing down at her. She met his eyes boldly. </p><p>He put on his suit coat. </p><p>“Yes,” he muttered shortly, and then he left.</p><p>The soon-to-be Minister for Magic watched him walk away, thinking that she’d never met a more arrogant nor intriguing wizard in her life.<br/>

<br/>
</p><p>It was time for Sunday roast at Grimmauld Place. The Black Family sat at a long dinner table in the elegant dining room. Only the clink and scraping of silverware could be heard. Pollux and Irma Black sat at opposite ends, their vision of one another obscured by a large centerpiece of maroon and purple dahlias. Alphard was visiting for the family’s Sunday dinner, as usual, and was seated beside his younger brother Cygnus. Orion sat beside Walburga. Irma glared at her; she had not quite gotten over the news of her daughter's terrible indiscretions at Malfoy Manor. Casting a killing curse at Albus Dumbledore’s daughter? It was currently the scandal of wizarding London.</p><p>Of course, Dumbledore hadn’t pressed charges, but that didn’t stop the story from spreading throughout the Ministry and every wizarding community from north to south of London. It made for an even more tasty bit of gossip due to the fact that her son, Alphard, was currently romantically linked to Dumbledore’s daughter. Such division and discord in her family was both distasteful and unseemly. </p><p>Irma couldn’t understand what she had done to cause her own flesh and blood daughter to be so shameful. The Black Family was prestigious and reputable, arguably the oldest pureblood line in Great Britain. Now her own daughter was the talk of London. She had <em> blatantly </em> attacked the daughter of Albus Dumbledore and cast the killing curse. Of course, they were just rumors, but Alphard had confirmed to his mother that it was, indeed, true, and that he had seen it with his own eyes. There were far too many witnesses, and Pollux and Irma had spent the past week putting out fires and shutting people up.</p><p>Irma Black had no love for Dumbledore nor his spawn, but she expected their reputation to be upheld and did not take kindly to the Black name (nor the Crabbe name, by extension) being besmirched.</p><p>“Alphard, dear, your name is in the papers quite often these days. You are <em> still </em> seeing Albus Dumbledore’s daughter, then?” Irma Black attempted to make small talk throughout the stilted dinner; she was not at all pleased that her son was currently publicly associated with the Ministry’s <em> Ambassador of Muggle Relations </em> (how dreadful) but she had never been able to control her son’s decisions. The more she tried, the harder he bucked against her. It was the Black curse, of course. She had always heard the Blacks were cursed with rebellious sons and daughters, but she hadn’t given it much credence until she’d married a Black and had children of her own. Now, she fully believed the superstition.</p><p>“Yes, Mother, I saw her only just this Thursday.”</p><p>“Oh,” she simpered, but her distaste was apparent. “Did you, now?”</p><p>“Ah… yes, we went dancing… at <em> The Ley Line </em>.”</p><p>“That dreadful place. That isn’t a place for well-to-do, upstanding witches and wizards. Let the muggle-borns and half-bloods frequent those places.”</p><p>Alphard laughed. “Mother, the Minister frequently visits there. It’s a rather exclusive club.”</p><p>His mother fixed her gaze on the centerpiece. “And are you and Miss Dumbledore quite serious then? I’ve seen your names in the papers for some months now.”</p><p>Alphard caught Walburga’s gaze. She raised her eyebrows as if to say, ‘Yes, Alphard, do <em> tell </em> us, is it serious?’</p><p>He sighed deeply. “I, for my part, would like it to be serious. However, I cannot speak for Miss Dumbledore.”</p><p>Walburga snorted. “Well, we all know she’s had her lips all over creation. Who knows? Perhaps she’s playing fast and loose with Abraxas Malfoy, as well.”</p><p>Alphard gave her an exasperated look, tensing his jaw and pursing his lips.</p><p>“What is she talking about, Alphard?” asked their father, Pollux.</p><p>Alphard glared at Walburga. </p><p>“Oh, Hermione was escorted to Malfoy’s dinner by Alphard, but I caught her kissing another wizard in the gardens,” Walburga piped up smugly. “Why do you think I dueled with her, father? I was defending my brother’s honor.”</p><p>Irma looked positively scandalized.</p><p>“Walburga, that is <em> quite </em> enough,” Alphard reprimanded sternly.</p><p>“Is it true, son?” asked Mr. Black.</p><p>Alphard rubbed his lips together and blinked slowly, biting back his frustration. “It is <em> much </em> more complex than Walburga is making it sound.”</p><p>“Is it really, brother? So you’ve talked with her about it, have you? Do tell us, what <em> did </em> the cunt say?”</p><p>“Walburga!” Irma Black stood instantly, towering over her children. “How <em> dare </em> you use that language in this house, in front of your <em> future husband </em> ! How debased must this family <em> be </em> because of you?”</p><p>The entire table went silent. Irma’s expression could’ve cut through stone. </p><p>As Irma once again took her seat, Alphard leaned across the table. “If you keep this up, I’m going to stop covering for you, sister.”</p><p>“What do I care?” she whispered coldly.</p><p>“Really?” he replied angrily.</p><p>Walburga shrugged nonchalantly, diverting her gaze. </p><p>“What is it?” asked Mr. Black. “What is not being said?”</p><p>Orion looked incredibly uncomfortable. Alphard glared at the gaudy centerpiece.</p><p>Walburga took a sip of her red wine. “I’ll tell you what’s not being said. Hermione Dumbledore is a whore.”</p><p>“Language!” Irma yelled.</p><p>“Alright, that does it!” Alphard snapped, tossing his napkin on the table. He stood and pointed at Walburga. “Walburga is still hung up on Tom <em> bloody </em> Riddle. She’s angry because Riddle wants Hermione, and not her. <em> Forgive </em> me, Orion.” He inclined his head to his younger cousin. “But Hermione is with <em> me </em>, Walburga, and it’s time to let it go, before you completely destroy your reputation!”</p><p>“Oh, make no mistake, brother,” Waburga smirked. “Hermione wants Riddle, too. Don’t let her lie to you.”</p><p>“Perhaps. Perhaps not. Time will tell, won’t it? That will be Hermione’s choice, but that still doesn’t change the fact that he doesn’t want <em> you </em> , and he <em> never </em> will, sister. Let it <em> go </em>.”</p><p>Irma rolled her eyes, aghast. “All this <em> uproar </em> about a <em> blood-traitor muggle-lover </em> and a <em> half-blood </em> .” Her eyes were sharp and piercing, and her tone betrayed her disgust. “This is <em> why </em> we stick to pure-blooded wizarding families. There’s nothing but chaos and distraction otherwise. This is perfectly shameful and insulting to your cousin. We will talk about it <em> no more </em> at this table, and I certainly hope this Hermione is not as much trouble as she sounds.”</p><p>“Mother,” Alphard said rigidly. “Your daughter cast an unforgivable in front of nearly every pureblood family in Britain last week. So who’s really the trouble here? Are you really going to listen to her over me? Hermione could end up a part of this family.”</p><p>Before Irma could answer, Walburga spat, “At least, <em> I </em> see her for what she is! She will <em> never </em> be a part of this family!”</p><p>“Yes, and we all see you for what <em> you </em> are, Walburga.”</p><p>Walburga smiled and leaned across the table. “Yes, and I see <em> you </em> for what you are, as well, brother. You’ve got no balls and you’re the cuck of Slytherin. Always losing to Riddle-”</p><p>“<em> Enough </em>!” Irma shrieked. She stood and left the table angrily.</p><p>Pollux Black glared at his son and daughter. Cygnus was silent, as usual; he cast a side-eye at Orion, but he was also silent, staring at his plate nervously. </p><p>For several minutes, there was nothing but the scrape of silverware once more. Walburga downed more red wine.</p><p>After a few more minutes, Irma returned, sat at her place, and the dinner commenced again, in silence. </p><p>Alphard and Walburga glared at each other.</p><p>Kreature entered the dining room and approached Walburga. Walburga had a closer-than-usual relationship with the strange elf, and so he performed every task specifically for her. “Mistress Black is having a parcel and a note delivered by owl this evening.” The elf handed her a small package and an envelope.</p><p>“Thank you, Kreature.” She unwrapped the parcel and found it was a small container, almost like a cigar box. She opened the envelope. There was only a short message scrawled on the inside, in elegant, spiky black penmanship which she was all too familiar with. Her chest tightened at the sight of it.</p><p>
<em> I warned you. You may find this bezoar useful. </em>
</p><p>Walburga’s brow furrowed, and she lifted the lid of the box to find that it contained a single bezoar, which she recognized from her sixth year potions class. She stared at it and felt a sinking feeling of dread, but she couldn’t explain why. </p><p>“What is it, Walburga?” asked her father.</p><p>She instinctively closed the envelope. “Nothing. Just a letter from a school friend.”</p><p>Her father nodded. Walburga took another sip of her wine, but her peace had been sufficiently disturbed. Why had he sent that note? Fear gripped her heart.</p><p>“Are you looking forward to going back to Hogwarts next week, Cygnus?” asked Alphard. “Will you play beater for Slytherin again?”</p><p>Cygnus nodded and released his breath, clearly relieved that the subject had been changed. “Oh yes, I-” </p><p>He stopped speaking, and his brow furrowed. His hand lifted to his throat, gripping it lightly as he turned his head to one side and then to the other.</p><p>“Ciggy?” Alphard hedged. “What’s wrong?”</p><p>Cygnus opened his mouth, but no sound came out. Suddenly, his throat began to swell, and his lips turned purple.</p><p>“Ciggy! What’s going on? Are you choking?” Alphard jumped up and his chair fell back onto the floor.</p><p>“Ciggy!” Walburga screamed.</p><p>Cygnus stood, gripping his throat, and then his eyes rolled back and he collapsed, convulsing on the ground.</p><p>Irma shrieked and they all crowded around him. Pollux immediately sent for Kreature to apparate to St. Mungo’s to seek a healer.</p><p>Walburga’s mouth fell open in shock, but in a sudden moment of understanding, she grabbed the bezoar, recalling that it could be used as an antidote to poison. She bent down, shoving her mother aside and stuffed the bezoar in her brother’s mouth, and closed it.</p><p>“Ciggy! Come on, Ciggy!” Tears began to stream down Walburga’s face.</p><p>Irma was still screaming. Alphard was attempting to cast diagnostic spells, but his entry-level spell revealed nothing. He immediately ran to the potions cabinet in the kitchen. </p><p>“Please, Ciggy,” Walburga sobbed. “Please.” </p><p>After another minute or two, Cygnus began taking shallow breaths. His face drained of its purple and blue color and began to redden. Then after another minute, it began to shift to a pale, fleshy color. </p><p>“Ciggy?”</p><p>Orion lightly slapped his face but Walburga shoved his hands aside. </p><p>Then, her brother opened his eyes and acted as if he wanted to speak, but his throat was dry and he could only croak.</p><p>“Water, Mother,” Walburga instructed. Irma returned from the kitchen with Alphard and a glass of water.</p><p>After another half an hour, Cygnus was back to normal, although a bit pale and both dizzy and nauseous. His mother confined him to bed for the remainder of the night. </p><p>The whole family stood around after he went to bed, bandying about theories of what had just happened to the younger Black sibling.</p><p>But Walburga knew. She said nothing; she had no idea what to do or what to say to her family. She knew that Riddle was smart. There would be no way anything could be pinned on him. He was one who always covered his tracks. All she could do was thank her lucky stars that he hadn’t intended to kill Cygnus. He was letting her know that he <em> could </em> ; that it would have been <em> that </em> easy. Walburga shivered. Her brother had just come so close to death, and it had been her fault. Riddle had warned her, and she hadn’t heeded his warning. Perhaps he was giving her a second chance because of their personal history. He always backed up his threats. She knew this. She’d seen it firsthand. Why had she been so <em> reckless </em> and <em> emotional </em>? Nothing was worth her brother’s life. Ciggy was the only person she truly cared for besides Riddle. She hadn’t thought he would really want to kill Cygnus. Perhaps, that alone was the reason he’d given her a second warning. She knew he wouldn’t be merciful enough to issue a third.</p><p>She would have to bide her time carefully and wait. Under the circumstances, it seemed revenge would be a long game. </p><p>That was just fine.</p><p>Walburga had nothing but time.</p>

Alphard Black was just leaving the flat of his friend, Amos Flint, after a raucous post-match party the following Saturday. He had considered bringing Hermione, but he had noticed she was rather bored at the last quidditch match he brought her to, although she had made a good show of being interested, for his benefit. At the moment, she was very busy preparing to leave for nearly a week to attend the quarterly convention of the International Confederation of Wizards. Alphard considered it dismal luck that she would be gone for a week when he desperately wanted to see her again following that kiss. He wanted <em> more </em> than a kiss. He’d thought of nothing else all weekend… which is precisely the reason he accompanied his friend Amos to the Harpies match. It was an adequate distraction.</p><p align="left">He’d had a few too many gillywaters and felt a bit red-faced as he took to the street and made his way to the apparition point. There were very few people on the street as it was nearly 2 am.</p><p>He was near the apparition point and he had started to question in his mind if he was sober enough to apparate without splinching himself. Broom travel was also out of the question. He was starting to think maybe he’d stop by his mate Rowle’s flat and floo home when he caught sight of someone up ahead, leaning against a lamppost. </p><p>As he neared, he recognized that it was Tom Riddle, still wearing his work uniform.</p><p>“Riddle? What the bloody hell are you doing here?”</p><p>Tom threw his cigarette onto the street and turned to approach Alphard, slipping his hand into his pocket. </p><p>He drew his wand.</p><p>“<em> Confundo </em>.”</p><p>Alphard’s sharp features instantly shifted from suspicious to dazed.</p><p>Tom smirked at him as he twirled his finger around the hooked end of his carved, bone-white yew wand.</p><p>“<em> Imperio </em>.”</p><p>The curse fell on Alphard with a wisp of green smoke.</p><p>“Alright, old chap. Come along then.”</p><p>Tom began to walk down the street, followed by a very confused and very dazed Alphard Black. Tom slipped down a narrow side street as the wizard followed suit. It was dimly lit by the meager flames of a few enchanted torches.</p><p>As Alphard came to stand behind Tom, he whipped around and stood face-to-face with the wizard. Riddle locked eyes with him and smiled pleasantly.</p><p>“<em> Legilimens </em>.”</p><p>He split through the wizard’s shoddy mental walls more roughly than was necessary. </p><p><em> You can thank me for the migraine, later, </em> he thought.</p><p>He began to rifle through the wizard’s memories with precision. Tom didn’t care to hear his boring internal drivel or see his bachelor-esque parties with Flint and Rowle, the useless sods. He knew exactly what he was looking for, and he found it within seconds.</p><p>Riddle became a bystander as he watched Hermione and Alphard apparate to <em> The Ley Line </em>. He noted that Hermione was looking particularly fit in an apple-red swing dress that fit her chest quite daringly and flared out at her waist. Its vest buttoned down the front and was perfectly tailored around her pert breasts, with a cheeky little collar. The sight had Alphard Black feeling quite randy and it irritated Tom to no end to have to hear Black’s internal musings about his witch while he rifled through the memories. He wished he could cast a silencing charm on Black’s obnoxious thoughts.</p><p>He watched detachedly as the two danced (Hermione was awful) and held back a smirk as Hermione stepped all <em> over </em> Alphard’s feet, then proceeded to suck down nearly seven sprite spritzers in the course of about forty minutes.</p><p><em> Never took her for a lush, but there’s the proof, </em> he thought amusedly. He considered teasing her about it, but he didn’t think it wise to inform her of his brutal trespass into Black’s thoughts.</p><p>Tom effectively fast-forwarded the memories until he was following them up to her flat. Irritation flared as he watched them flirting.<br/>
<br/>
<em> You do enjoy toying with wizards, don’t you, little witch? </em> Tom thought.</p><p>It mattered little to Tom. He’d already decided that their little dalliance was over. He felt it was high time that he took what belonged to him, Black be damned.</p><p>“Perhaps I find you charming,” Hermione murmured, her hand gripping Black’s tie.</p><p>Tom snorted. <em> He’s about as charming as an infestation of cornish pixies. </em></p><p>They entered the flat and Alphard presently began massaging Hermione’s aching foot. A little moan escaped her throat.</p><p>Tom eyed the gesture, cracking his neck. He felt a particular possessiveness over her delicate feet and ankles, another strange compulsion of his, and being forced to listen to Black’s inner monologue about how desirous they were really <em> irked </em> Tom. He suddenly wanted to take off Black’s hands. No magic involved. He wanted to burn them off with a match and some gasoline.</p><p>He thought of sending the ashes to Hermione in a box.</p><p>Tom chuckled at Hermione’s jibe, comparing Alphard to a house elf.</p><p>
<em> An apt comparison, darling. </em>
</p><p>“Would you like me on my knees, Dumbledore?” Alphard asked in a raspy voice.</p><p>
<em> Sure, she does, Black. Because she’s just as twisted inside as I am. </em>
</p><p>Black kissed her. Tom’s jaw tensed. His eyes immediately shifted to blazing crimson. </p><p>Black’s thoughts took a quite lascivious turn. Tom saw red. He didn’t want to hear Black’s thoughts about Hermione’s mouth. About how badly he wanted her lips wrapped around his cock. Every muscle in Tom’s body tensed.</p><p>He only coveted <em> Hermione’s </em> thoughts. But he could not know them. To not be able to control her, or know her precise reaction to the kiss drove Tom mad.</p><p>Every single one of his Death Eaters submitted to routine legilimency. Tom couldn’t stand not knowing <em> everything </em>. He wanted any and all information readily available to him, right at his fingertips. If they refused, then he assumed they had something to hide, and if they had something to hide, then they were a liability, and better off dead in his mind.</p><p>“Why did you stop?” Hermione whispered.</p><p>
<em> Because he’s about to get himself burned alive and he’s not entirely mental. </em>
</p><p>“I expect another date. Soon.”</p><p>”And you shall have it,” whispered Hermione.</p><p>
<em>I wouldn’t make any promises, little witch.</em>
</p><p>Tom watched the end of their encounter with cold aloofness and then withdrew from Black’s thoughts.</p><p>Riddle was very still for several minutes. Then he sighed and flicked his eyes over at Black.</p><p>“My witch’s birthday is coming up. Bet you didn’t know that. I don’t suppose you would. You didn’t pull her ministry records in a fit of suspicion, like I did.”</p><p>Tom suddenly hauled back and punched Alphard square in the nose. Blood spurted from the wound as Black doubled over in pain.</p><p>“I don’t suppose she would enjoy receiving your tongue as a birthday present… in a nice little box, with a pretty bow?” Tom grinned as Alphard shook his head, gripping his nose and groaning as blood seeped through his fingers. “No? Yeah, you’re probably right.” </p><p>He glanced at Alphard where he’d fallen onto his knees. “It is tempting though. Perhaps… just a finger?” He knelt and took Alphard’s right hand and selected the finger on which there was a ring bearing the Black family crest. “See, I don’t think my little witch believes that I make good on threats. Clearly, from that little kiss, it doesn’t seem as if she believes that I <em> really </em> will kill you if you fuck her. I don’t think she <em> wants </em> to fuck you, to be perfectly honest. But I do think she’d do it to spite me. She is a vindictive little witch, after all. I like that about her.” He looked at Black. “You wouldn’t know that, though. You don’t know her like I do.” </p><p>Tom looked at Alphard, who was starting to become lucid again. “<em> Confundo </em> ,” he muttered with a flick of his wand. “No body parts then. Not yet, anyway. I suppose the right thing to do would be to <em> talk </em> to her. That <em> is </em> what couples do, right? In relationships?” He lifted his eyebrows and shrugged. “I wouldn’t know. I only ever fucked your sister’s nonexistent brains out. We didn’t really talk about much. Never really had the urge, to be honest.”</p><p>He stood and pulled Alphard with him so that they were face to face. Alphard was slightly shorter, so Tom’s eyes met his eyebrows. “<em> Episkey </em> .” Of a sudden, Alphard’s nose cracked as it set itself and he groaned. “But Hermione’s different. I’ve got to be more subtle. Use a gentler touch. Isn’t that what draws her to you? You’re the nice guy.” Tom grinned. “You <em> must </em> be, because you always did finish last.”</p><p>Tom’s jaw tensed as he glared at Alphard Black. “I do <em> so </em> want to cut out your tongue. I could do it. So easily… just a little slicing hex would do the job. You <em> deserve </em> it, you know. You kissed Hermione. You should really be dead.” He gripped Alphard by the throat and threw him back against the brick wall of the alleyway. “I’ve wanted to kill you since third year. Should’ve set my basilisk on you. In any case… I think your little dalliance with my witch has run its course, don’t you?’</p><p>Tom cocked his head as he looked at the eldest Black son. “Right. I think you’re going to stay the fuck away from her, and I’m going to make sure of it.” He released Alphard’s throat and straightened his old rival’s suit coat. “The next time we meet, Hermione will be mine, and you’ll know it. You’ll be nothing but an ex-boyfriend, and you’ll have no one to blame but yourself, really. You must <em> love </em> to lose.” Tom stared into his mismatched eyes, still glazed over from the confundus charm. “So sorry to hear of your brother’s near-death experience, by the way. Must have been awful, what with him <em> collapsing </em> right there at the dinner table. Quite lucky your sister had the presence of mind to think of a bezoar. That was right ingenious, that was. Probably the only inspired thought she’s ever had.”</p><p>Tom sighed. “Right.” He pointed his wand at Alphard’s forehead. “Obliviate.”</p><p><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
</p><p>Hermione was currently packing for a week’s worth of international assemblies and convocations. She’d studied the itinerary and the caucus agenda for several days and had subsequently brushed up on all of the current events, legislation, and global issues which would be addressed by various committees during the convening. Hermione was already considered quite young to be included as a delegate at the age of nineteen, so she wanted to be thorough and well-read just in case. She wanted to be able to hold her own and bring her own ideas and opinions to the table, if necessary. She knew that most of the agenda wouldn’t relate to her or even be brought before her; Britain had had an almost <em> boring </em> quarter. There had been no breaches of the statute to speak of, and most of the recently proposed laws had gone uncontested by the general public. </p><p>The only real drama in the British wizarding community had come from Hermione’s own revelation about the goblin’s curse on galleons, and the building of a new wizarding bank. She was more than prepared to answer questions about it, and she’d packed up all of her research and notes on the subject.</p><p>On Sunday afternoon, she would portkey directly into Plovdiv, Bulgaria, where she would be met by her local guide and another of the British delegates. Piksy twittered about, helping her pack. The elf was actually quite efficient at packing and had miraculously organized Hermione’s beaded bag and brought it into some semblance of order. The little elf had wailed all morning about Hermione leaving (she’d grown rather fond of Hermione) and complained about not having anything to do while her mistress was away. Hermione had been sure to stock the pantry with plenty of sweets (Piksy’s favorites) and in the spirit of helping the poor elf, she’d bought an array of new plants and gardening tools, instructing her to work on the veranda gardens while she was gone. She’d also accumulated quite the wardrobe from her regular attendance of events and the constant gifting of new styles from Twillfit &amp; Tattings &amp; Madam Malkin’s, so she left Piksy in charge of organizing her wardrobe by color and style. </p><p>Piksy had laid out several new styles of formal robes, which had been tailored for Hermione just for the trip. There were structured long-sleeved &amp; high-necked robes with gold filigree shoulder plates and elaborate patterns quilted into the fabric. One particular black set of robes bore gold chains that connected from shoulder to shoulder. They were quite high-bred and aristocratic fittings, and they made Hermione feel queenly and powerful.</p><p>“Dress for success, as the muggles say, Piksy.”</p><p>“The muggles say many things, Miss Dumbledore.”</p><p>Hermione laughed. “Yes, they do, Piksy. They are a rather articulate bunch.”</p><p>Hermione gazed down at the clothing and thought of her parents. She missed them tremendously… but she wouldn’t let herself think about them. There was really nothing to be done about it.</p><p>But Hermione had been thinking deeply of late. </p><p>She’d thought about the war, of Harry and Ron, and of the pen which had sent her here. She thought about Riddle.</p><p>Perhaps, it was the kiss with Alphard Black that had sparked a deep search of her own soul.</p><p>Against her own wishes, all she’d thought about during the kiss was Tom Riddle.</p><p>Hermione realized that she had probably been running in the exact opposite direction than she should have been. </p><p>Perhaps avoiding Riddle was the wrong strategy.</p><p>If she ever wanted to get back to her time, Riddle was the only one who held the answers. It was <em> his </em> enchantment which had sent her here, in the first place.</p><p>If she wanted to change the future and save lives, only Riddle knew where the horcruxes were. <em> He </em> was the one she needed to kill in order to change the course of the war.</p><p>She couldn’t do so without getting close to him…</p><p>… and he <em> clearly </em> wanted to be close to her. It might be to her benefit to take advantage of that.</p><p>She had avoided him out of fear of the strange connection between them. She was afraid of the effect he had on her. He was a <em> murderer </em>. He frightened her to her core.</p><p>But at the same time… perhaps allowing herself to get close to him was the only course of action left to Hermione.</p><p>Of course, she wasn’t unhappy living in this time. She liked her career as a columnist. She enjoyed representing the Ministry and the muggle world. She felt as if she were breaking mindsets and doing some good in the wizarding community at large. She liked Piksy, and she liked the person she was becoming in this world.</p><p>Hermione was also closer to Dumbledore than she’d ever been. He was teaching her to wield forms of magic that she’d only ever read about… and even magic that she’d never known even <em> existed </em>.</p><p>Did she really want to go back to her time, to a world where Dumbledore no longer existed, and she had no real direction? To a world where so many loved ones had already been murdered? Perhaps she could simply stay here… if she killed Riddle, then she could live in peace knowing that she’d made the world a safer place for the people she cared about.</p><p>She didn’t know if she wanted to stay or go back home, but she wanted to at least have the <em> choice </em>.</p><p>Riddle was asking lots of questions about where she came from, and she’d foolishly baited him out of anger. </p><p>Unfortunately, Hermione was jealous of Walburga. She hated to admit it to herself, but the thought of Riddle sleeping with Walburga, for <em> six years </em> no less, had caused a tightness in her chest and a turning of her stomach that Hermione hadn’t even experienced so strongly with Ron and Lavender Brown. It was her own fault; she’d let Riddle in at Malfoy Manor. Her cheeks still blushed even thinking about that night.</p><p>The thought of shifting strategies to <em> get closer </em> to Riddle was terrifying. He’d made it perfectly obvious what he wanted. Hermione had already let him push her well past her own personal boundaries. He’d done it so easily. That frightened Hermione, because she realized that if she gave in even the tiniest bit, Riddle would take advantage of that. </p><p>But what other alternative was there? If she did nothing, he would continue on his path of destruction and dark magic and eventually, he would gain enough support to rise up as Lord Voldemort and hunt down people she cared about. He would kill Harry’s parents.</p><p>These thoughts troubled Hermione. </p><p>What disturbed her most of all was the confusion she felt. </p><p>Part of her wanted to kill Tom. Another part <em> wanted </em> Tom.</p><p>Her hands began to tremble. She sought out her nightly elixir, and decided to call it a night.</p>

It was Monday evening, and Tom was practicing the astral arts. He was planning to leave London for several days to visit Albania, where he would study with Zephyris; he needed the ability to become corporeal when projecting his soul. He also hoped that Zephyris possessed the subtle knowledge of how to project to very distant locations. Tom had decided this would be a very powerful, although dangerous, skill to learn and he coveted the knowledge greatly. </p><p>Tom had taken time off work for the trip; he didn’t mind being gone for a while seeing as Hermione was currently away in Bulgaria for the week. In fact, he had been looking for a reason to leave. He was itching for progress; he’d been distracted of late and was ready to get back to his practice of dark magic.</p><p>He ensured that the wards and enchantments on his flat were secure, and then laid on his bed and proceeded to cleave his soul from his body.</p><p>Suddenly he stood, a soul staring down at his physical body, now devoid of life. There was naught but a thin, brilliant silver cord connecting his soul to his body. It was slightly easier to project now that he had split his soul twice already. The absence of the other pieces which were encased in his horcruxes made his soul much lighter.</p><p>There was a reason the astral arts were considered a dark art. If one split their soul from their body in order to travel as a spirit, then one of two things could happen. One’s physical body could be killed, leaving the soul suspended and destined to wander the earth, like a ghost; or, one’s physical body could be <em> possessed </em>by another soul traveler. It was risky business, but Tom was nothing if not daring.</p><p>Fortunately, Tom had learned a protective enchantment used by many soul travelers. It essentially used ancient runes to form an impenetrable circle of magic around one’s physical body. Tom stared down at the red runic sphere that glowed on the wood floor surrounding his bed. He could never be too cautious when it came to his soul.</p><p>He’d decided he would explore Hermione’s flat while she was away, provided the building had no protective wards to keep him out. He’d seen a glimpse of where she lived in Alphard Black’s memories, and ever since, he’d been curious. </p><p>Soul travel was much quicker than physical travel; it was quite incredible the things that one could manage when not tethered to the flesh of a human body. Within minutes, Tom was standing in the historic district of Horizont Alley. It was an affluent side of the wizarding community, with elaborate buildings and antiquated architecture. The building was quite French in style, with baroque cornices and gargoyles stationed on each side. Tom recalled the number one dialed in the phone booth to gain entry, but he didn’t need it. He approached the building and immediately tested it for wards. If it was blocked against spirits, then he wouldn’t be able to cross the threshold. But to his luck, he was able to walk right through the walls of the establishment and into the lobby. He couldn’t rightly take the elevator; he couldn’t yet become corporeal, so he couldn’t press the buttons. Instead, he simply ascended through the ceilings of each floor until he reached the penthouse, and unfortunately he saw a few things he would rather not have. </p><p>Finally, he reached the hallways of Hermione’s floor. He wished he had his wand so he could test the protective measures she’d placed on her door. He made a mental note to do that at a later time when he was here in person.</p><p>Tom disappeared right through the front door of her flat and began to take a look around. The place was spotless, which he supposed was her house elf’s doing. The floors of the flat were old, dark hardwoods. The walls and ceilings had expensive wallpaper and gold sconces, elaborate embellishments, and crown moulding. It was also enormous. Her flat took up the entire penthouse apartment. Through the endless, floor-to-ceiling windows, he could see over all of Horizont Alley and even beyond, to the rest of London. He could see London Bridge glowing over the Thames.</p><p>Tom crossed the sitting room, with its Persian rugs and burgundy velvet Chesterfield sofas. The flat was a tasteful mixture of the more vintage Victorian style and the modern art deco movements. They blended seamlessly throughout her flat, and he wondered if she’d been the one to decorate it. Tom could care less about such things at his own place, but he could recognize the eye for beauty and the artful restraint that it took to be elegant in a simplistic way. It reminded him of the fashionable, yet timeless way that Hermione dressed herself. Tom realized that he often took his time when taking in her appearance as if she were a work of art to be analyzed and appreciated slowly. </p><p>So far, he didn’t see anything that triggered his suspicion. Perhaps once he learned to become corporeal, he would be able to search the flat more thoroughly. </p><p>Tom wandered until he found what he’d really come for: her books. He was extremely pleased with what he found. She was the only person who had a more elaborate and wide range of reading material than Tom himself, with the exception of Malfoy. He looked at the spines of the books; he’d never heard of many of them. He couldn’t pull them off, so he contented himself with scanning their titles. Books on magical creatures, potion brewing, arithmancy, divination, magical history, and spellbook after spellbook. There were some muggle books that he also didn’t recognize, but he made a note to look them up later. He grew rather frustrated after several minutes because he wanted nothing more than to crack a few of them open and examine them in depth, particularly her books on potions. He wondered if she had any particular adeptness in potions due to her mother’s potioneering lineage. His eyes fell on a children’s book: The Tales of Beedle the Bard. He was familiar with it, although he’d never read it. There never were story times growing up at the orphanage.</p><p>Hermione owned a copy of A History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot. He wondered why it looked so old and battered; it had only been published last year. Tom shrugged it away; if anyone was capable of abusing a book, it was his witch. He’d noticed she went positively feral over literature.</p><p>“You shall have all the books your heart desires, little witch,” he whispered.<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>He browsed the other titles; some he had heard of, and some he had not.<br/>

</p><p> </p><p>Where had she found all of these books? Tom made a mental note to check up on some of them.</p><p>He had rather hoped there were some tomes relating to her spell-casting abilities; particularly her bi-casting and tri-casting techniques. Perhaps Dumbledore had taught her those, but Tom couldn’t recall ever seeing Dumbledore perform such a feat either.</p><p>Tom looked outside into the gardens and saw her house elf fussing over the plants on the terrace. There were quite audacious amounts of herbs and flora. </p><p><em> I’m guessing she’s a fan of plants, </em> he snickered to himself.</p><p>Tom wandered through the kitchen, marveling at the sheer size of her flat, its high ceilings, and costly fixtures. The silver cord which tethered him to his body was beginning to tighten uncomfortably; it always did when he was away for very long. </p><p>He caught himself and stopped. There, on her kitchen counter, was a glass pastry dish with a see-through lid. Sitting underneath the lid was a batch of scones, exactly like the ones he’d been sent at the shop a month ago. Before he realized it, he was grinning. </p><p>“Good luck denying it now, little witch,” he murmured.</p><p>He reached out to touch the lid, but his hand simply passed through the glass.</p><p>“A soul traveler with a taste for scones. Interesting.”</p><p>Tom whipped around at the sound of an unfamiliar female voice. </p><p>His eyes caught on a woman standing several feet away from him, in the dining room. She was an older witch, but she possessed a sort of ageless beauty. She had dark grey and silver hair which fell in wild ringlets to her waist. She was dressed impeccably, with expensive jewelry and witchly accoutrements. She peered at him with piercing green eyes.</p><p>He returned her gaze, eyes narrowing. “Who the hell are you?”</p><p>The woman met his gaze boldly. “I am Violette.” Her voice carried a thick French accent.</p><p>His brow furrowed. “What are you doing here?”</p><p>She smiled. “I could ask you the same question.”</p><p>Tom lifted an eyebrow, looking around himself. “How can you see me?”</p><p>She held her arms wide, palms upward. “How do you think?”</p><p>Tom’s skin pricked. “You’re either a soul traveler, or a ghost.”</p><p>She smiled again and nodded. “I walk amongst ze living, yet I am not of them.”</p><p>He cocked his head to the side. “You’re dead.”</p><p>“Oui.”</p><p>Suddenly, realization dawned on Tom. “You’re the seer. The French woman that haunts these flats.”</p><p>She smiled mysteriously. “I see my reputation precedes me… but so does <em> yours </em>, Monsieur Riddle.”</p><p>His eyebrows lifted. “You know my name?”</p><p>“I know many things.”</p><p>He glanced around. “Do you know the girl who lives here?”</p><p>The ghost smiled softly. “I have never spoken with her. But I know her very well.”</p><p>“How do you know my name?”</p><p>The ghost’s green eyes pierced him, seeming to glow with a preternatural essence. “I have seen many of your lives… in the <em> aether </em>.”</p><p>Tom’s eyes narrowed. “You are a seer. Can you see the future?”</p><p>“I can,” she murmured. “I can see your future… and all of its twists, and turns… and divergences.”</p><p>“Can you?” Tom’s eyes lit up, flashing red. “And what do you see?”</p><p>Violette stared at him. “Your future is dark. The darkest I’ve ever seen.”</p><p>Tom’s jaw tensed. “Really?”</p><p>The ghost nodded. </p><p>Tom wanted to ask her more, but he somehow knew that she wouldn’t tell him. Seeing a ghost as a soul traveler was different; she looked much more human than she would have if he were to look upon her with his mortal eyes. She looked very real. He also felt a strange reverence for this witch. Had she been a witch during her life? She had a very solemn presence, which made Tom feel deferential.</p><p>Her lips turned up in a knowing smile and she pinned Tom with a stare. “Ze girl who lives here. You are connected, no?”</p><p>Tom tilted his head slightly. “You tell me.”</p><p>Her smile widened, green eyes sparkling playfully. “Most assuredly. She is your soulmate.”</p><p>Tom’s eyebrows shot up. “Excuse me?”</p><p>“Did you not hear me?”</p><p>Tom pressed his tongue against his cheek. “I… did, yes.” He spoke very slowly. “But you said… she’s my <em> soulmate </em>?”</p><p>Violette looked at him as if he were hard of hearing. “Yes. <em> She is </em>.”</p><p>Tom laughed incredulously. “You say that so casually. As if you’re announcing that it’s Tuesday.”</p><p>She smiled. Her smiles came so easily. “It is actually Monday, Monsieur Riddle.”</p><p>Tom found that he both enjoyed this ghost and felt disarmed by her at the same time. “How do you know she’s my soulmate?”</p><p>She took a step forward, then leaned against the wall as she looked at him. “When we seers look at someone, we can see ze’re aura, ze colors of it. Usually, soul mates’ colors will correspond in some way. If someone has a soulmate, only half of ze aura can be seen. Your colors are quite stark.”</p><p>He cocked a brow. “Stark? What do you mean?”</p><p>“I can only see half of your aura. It is pitch black, like ze night. But ze girl who lives here. <em> Hermione </em> . Her aura is pure white, like ze clouds. I have never seen colors like zis. It is très unusual. Zis is because you are not simply soul mates… but twin flames, or <em> mirror souls </em>. You are opposites. You are the cold serpent in the earth, Monsieur Riddle, and your Hermione is the flaming phoenix in the sky.”</p><p>Tom fixed her with a suspicious gaze. “I’ve never believed in soulmates.”</p><p>She chuckled. “You don’t have to, Monsieur. It matters not. You do believe in ze girl who lives here, do you not? You are here, after all, in her home.” Her green eyes twinkled. “You miss her.”</p><p>He smirked. “What else do you see in the future?”</p><p>Violette smiled. “Zis, I cannot tell you… and you cannot threaten to kill me, Monsieur Riddle, because I am already dead.”</p><p>Riddle laughed. “Lucky you.” It unnerved Tom somewhat that she seemed to know his secrets. He wondered if she knew Hermione’s as well.</p><p>The woman’s lips were turned up playfully, but her eyes were serious. “The girl… she will redeem your soul. She will protect it.”</p><p>Riddle’s eyebrows furrowed sharply and he took a step forward. “What do you mean?”</p><p>The ghost shook her head. “Z’at is for you to discover. You will try to lead her. But you must also allow <em> her </em> to lead you.”</p><p>Before Riddle could respond, the woman turned and walked through the brick wall of the flat, disappearing into the night.</p><p> </p><hr/><p><br/>
Tom wasn’t totally convinced of the validity of what the woman claimed. Ghosts were well-known for lying and meddling with witches and wizards and muggles alike, purely because they had nothing else to do with their endless amounts of time. However, something about the way the ghost talked piqued his curiosity. Perhaps that, coupled with his strange dreams about Hermione and the Tempaestus, in addition to the way he felt about her… led Tom to believe it was entirely possible, if soulmates did indeed exist. </p><p>Tom had never imagined himself with a companion. He’d never given a second thought to real romantic entanglements or marriage. Perhaps, given the circumstances of his birth, he’d even shied away from the idea. Walburga Black had never been anything more than a warm body to fuck, to put it crassly, and he’d hoped it would remain the same way for her. Unfortunately, she went and pulled a Merope Gaunt and fell in love with him like a twit. He hated when women pushed their affections on a man. It positively irked him, given the bizarre circumstances of his own birth. His mother went and fell in love with a bloke who didn’t love her back, and thus Tom Riddle was born, and forced to live a stale and colorless childhood in an orphanage. All because some twit had her head addled with notions of love and soulmates. Not that Tom wasn’t capable of making lemonade out of the lemons he’d been handed in life, but that was beside the point. The point was, Tom hadn’t expected that he would ever want or <em> need </em> anyone for that matter. He didn’t think himself truly capable of it. He still wasn’t convinced he was capable of that level of passion or love. Obsession and desire? Yes. Love? He didn’t know. He had no experience with such things.</p><p>Did a soulmate require love? Or was it possible to enjoy the benefits of such a union without the ability to channel that particular emotion? </p><p>What <em> were </em> the benefits of having a soulmate?</p><p>He’d heard a few things throughout the years in passing regarding <em> soulmate magic </em>, but as he’d never believed in soulmates, he’d glossed over those particular findings.</p><p>Now, his interest had been provoked. He’d planned to apparate directly to Albania in the morning, but now he had a burning desire to research the topic more. He decided it could be done in the morning before he left. </p><p>Tom promptly followed the pulling of the silver cord as he retreated several miles back into his body. </p><p>He took a deep breath, then opened his eyes. He was back in his flat, surrounded by a glowing red circle of runes. He quickly dismantled the protective enchantments and went to sleep.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p>At around six a.m. the next morning, Tom was already searching the Malfoy Manor library high and low until he found the particular book he was looking for. He summoned the book from one of the top shelves and ran his fingers over the antique, leather-bound tome etched with blue and gold stitching. <em> The Sorcery of the Soule </em>. He opened it and flipped carefully through the brittle pages. It had been hand-copied by the sixteenth-century sorcerers of Sicily, and Tom had combed through it a few years ago whilst searching for more information on horcruxes. The book hadn’t contained any useful information on splitting the soul, but he did recall reading something about soulmates. The book was ornate and painstakingly copied in middle english with flourishing drop caps and original rennaissance artwork.</p><p>He flipped through the book until about halfway through, he came upon a chapter that detailed the myth of the Soulemate. It was from Plato’s <em> Symposium </em>, a tale told by Aristophanes. </p><p>According to Greek mythology, humans were originally created with four arms, four legs and a head with two faces. Fearing their power, Zeus split them into two separate parts, condemning them to spend their lives in search of their other halves. </p><p>The true story, according to Renaissance sorcerers, is that witches and wizards were descended from the gods themselves, which is where their magic came from. In order to stop wizardkind from becoming too powerful, the gods split their souls in half and destined them to reincarnate for eternity, searching for the other half of their souls.</p><p>Tom looked up from his reading to see Abraxas entering through the double doors of the library. </p><p>“Good morning, my Lord. I thought I heard someone floo in.”</p><p>Tom nodded but said nothing. He was pensive as he tried to make sense of the Middle English folklore. It sounded like nothing but myth and medieval gibberish to him.</p><p>Still, Tom had learned that there was almost always some grain of truth in all folklore.</p><p>“I thought you were going to be traveling for the week, my Lord. Was there a change of plans?”</p><p>Tom shook his head distractedly. “No… no, I’m going. I just needed to research something first.”</p><p>Abraxas came nearer and took a seat in a chair across from where Tom was seated by the hearth. He tilted his head, taking note of the book in Tom’s hand.</p><p>“Studying on the soul again, are we?”</p><p>Tom flicked his eyes at Abraxas. “Something like that.”</p><p>“I’ve combed that book front and back. I could tell you anything you want to know.”</p><p>Tom looked up again. “Why would you have combed through this particular book?”</p><p>Abraxas smirked and gave a little chuckle. “I was reading about soulmates once upon a time.”</p><p>That piqued Tom’s interest. He looked up from the book and gave Abraxas a searching look. “Why were you reading about soulmates?”</p><p>Malfoy looked somewhat embarrassed. “Well… I once thought Peoria Parkinson might be my soulmate. Back in fourth year.”</p><p>Tom stared at Abraxas with a blank look. </p><p>Abraxas shifted uncomfortably. “Don’t look at me like that, it was an honest mistake. Should’ve seen the tits on her. She was a right fit witch. Still is.”</p><p>Tom blinked twice. “You thought… <em> Peoria… </em> was your soulmate?”</p><p>Abraxas sighed. “It was an honest mistake, Tom. Not my finest moment. She was the first witch I… well<em> , you know. </em>”</p><p>Tom grinned slowly. Then, he laughed, shaking his head. “You’re an absolute plum, Malfoy. A complete wanker.”</p><p>Abraxas laughed in turn. “Go on then, have a laugh at my expense.”</p><p>Tom had stopped laughing but the dry amusement still showed in his face. “It’s downright hilarious. Abraxas Malfoy, premier pureblood bachelor of London, deflowered by Peoria Parkinson.”</p><p>Abraxas shook his head. “You always did take the piss out of me on a regular basis. But I don’t think I’ve seen you laugh in years, Tom.”</p><p>Tom’s eyes were already scanning the book again. “Don’t get used to it.”</p><p>“Wouldn’t dream of it.” Abraxas glanced over at Tom. “I’m serious though, I know just about everything there is about soulmates.”</p><p>“Alright then,” Tom said shortly, snapping the book shut. He took a deep breath. “What’s this about wizards and witches being gods and souls being split in half?”</p><p>“Ah, yes,” Abraxas muttered. “Well, many of the pureblood families, the oldest ones, mind you, still believe it. That is, that witches and wizards were children of the gods. That is why the purer the blood, the better. According to legend, the gods split their children’s souls in half to prevent their magic from being too strong, to ultimately prevent them from waging war on humans, or muggles. They would be forced to reincarnate as they searched for their true other half. In some instances, it would take hundreds or even thousands of years for the two souls to incarnate into the same lifetime and find one another. It was a very rare occurrence. But when it did happen in isolated instances, there were certain rituals that could be performed.”</p><p>Tom’s cocked an eyebrow. “What rituals?”</p><p>Abraxas seemed to be thinking. “I believe there may be a book here on Soul Bonds… I will have Dobby check for you, if you like. It could take you a while to locate it. If I remember correctly, there was a particular spell that could determine if one’s soulmate had been found. Then there was a ritual that could bind the two souls together, tethering them and their magical cores forever. I believe there was something about the silver cord of the soul, and how it connects soulmates together. There was a way to <em> use </em> the cord to form the bond. Of course, any two people could perform the soul bond, but <em> only </em> if the two souls were <em> true </em> soulmates, would the magical power that would result from such a union be astronomically enhanced. Invincible, really.”</p><p>Tom’s face was a blank mask but his interest brimmed just beneath the surface. “I see.” Tom suddenly grinned. “And did you perform the spell to discover whether Princess Peoria was your soulmate?”</p><p>Abraxas instantly let his face drop. “Right, right, just continue to take the mickey out of me.”</p><p>Tom laughed again, despite himself. “You did, didn’t you? Bloody tosser.”</p><p>“I did, and it was inconclusive, and I was right gutted, and then the whole bloody relationship went to pot after that.”</p><p>Tom’s eyes fell shut and he was clearly holding back uproarious laughter. “I do recall old Peoria havin’ her knickers in a twist about something but I hadn’t a clue you’d shagged her. Now all her whinging makes sense.”</p><p>Abraxas tilted his head to the side and smirked. “I mean, if we’re being honest, I think it was the other way around. She fucked me, good and proper too.”</p><p>Tom finally leaned back and threw his arm over his eyes and succumbed to the laughter. “<em> Salazar </em>, I’ve got to get more sleep. I’m positively knackered.”</p><p>Abraxas grinned at the sight of Tom in absolute stitches. “Why are you studying on the topic, Tom?”</p><p>Tom sobered and then flicked his eyes at Abraxas. “I wasn’t. I just happened upon the book and found the tale about wizards and the gods fascinating.”</p><p>Abraxas lit up. “Oh, yes, terribly fascinating. I grew up hearing those tales and myths. Truth be told, all of the oldest magical families still believe it, they just don’t speak of it in today’s social climate. Not a popular belief nowadays.”</p><p>“No. I should think not.” Tom stood. “I’d still like to read the book on Soul Bonds. Have your house elf find it for me. I’ll take a look at it when I return.”</p><p>“Certainly, my Lord. Best of luck with your endeavors as you travel.”</p><p>“Appreciated Malfoy, but I don’t need luck.”</p><p>“No, of course not. Will we be meeting Saturday, then?”</p><p>“Move it to next.”</p><p>“Very good.”</p><p>Tom clapped him on the shoulder. “I’ll see you when I return, Brax.” Then quickly, he left.</p><p>Abraxas stood watching his school friend leave, thinking that it had almost felt like old times in the Slytherin common room… for only a brief moment.</p><p>He feared it would be years before he would get a glimpse of that Tom once more… or perhaps, he might never see his old friend resurface again.</p><p>Malfoy filed the moment away to bring to memory the next time Tom cursed him… to remind himself that he did in fact, love Tom. He could bear the brunt of Voldemort’s wrath as long as he knew his friend was still there, lurking beneath the surface somewhere, buried however deep.</p><p><br/>

<em>I can't hold enough of you in my hands</em><br/>
<strong>- Franz Kafka</strong>
</p><p><br/>
Early on Monday morning, Hermione portkeyed into Plovdiv, Bulgaria using a little muggle snowglobe, which was apparently the portkey of choice for the British delegation of the International Confederation of Wizards. She was met in a little magical pub by a house elf named Treckle who then apparated her to a lavish hotel in the centre of the wizarding district of Plovdiv. She was to meet in the lobby of the hotel with the other British delegates in the afternoon, and they would then be taken by thestral carriage to the site of the first evening’s commencements.</p><p>Hermione settled into her lovely suite, which had a large bay window with a balcony overlooking the city, a little breakfast nook, and a big fluffy bed with a canopy. Treckle the house elf was assigned to be her personal guide to the city during her stay, and she only had to call him by name if she needed anything.</p><p>In the afternoon, Hermione made her way down to the lobby and was promptly introduced to the two other delegates with which she would be seated during the convention proceedings. There was a middle-aged woman with dark hair, and a tall, strapping young man with a shock of bright curly orange hair. The man looked to be in his early thirties and was speaking with the slightly older woman when Hermione came down the stairs. When Hermione entered the room, he turned with a brilliant smile.</p><p>“Hermione Dumbledore! We meet at last,” he said jubilantly.</p><p>“Oh, <em> hello </em>! What a warm welcome,” Hermione said with a smile. “You must be the other delegates I’ve yet to meet.”</p><p>“I’m <em> quite </em> surprised we haven’t met already,” said the man. “I’ve heard so much about you. You’re making quite a name for yourself… not that you didn’t already have one, being a Dumbledore and all. That’s a rather hefty name to live up to, but you’re clearly making <em> great </em> strides, as one would expect. My name is Septimus. Septimus Weasley.”</p><p>“Oh… <em> Weasley </em>! But of course, you are!” Hermione couldn’t believe they hadn’t met already; stranger yet, that she hadn’t sought him out. This must be the grandfather Ron had told her so much about. It was quite apparent by the tell-tale red hair.</p><p>Septimus gestured to the woman he was with. She had dark hair and pale skin, and was a remarkably pretty lady. “This is Callidora Longbottom, my sister-in-law.”</p><p>“It’s wonderful to meet you,” Hermione said warmly, extending her hand.</p><p>The woman smiled as she took Hermione’s hand, but it was a cool, cautious smile. “You as well. Septimus married my sister, Cedrella. We were Blacks before marriage. I’ve heard you’re rather close to one of my distant cousins… Alphard.”</p><p>“Oh,” Hermione started, but she looked a bit uncomfortable. “Yes, well, we <em> do </em> see each other often.”</p><p>At that, Septimus clearly thought it best to change the subject. “I work for the Ministry, in the Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes, Muggle Liason Office. I’m a bit of a muggle activist, of sorts. I’ve been so greatly inspired with your articles. I’ve read every one. I suppose I’ve hoped we might collaborate at some point.”</p><p>“I would absolutely love that!” Hermione said genuinely.</p><p>Callidora wrinkled her nose a bit and presently made her way across the lobby in search of a cuppa. Septimus glanced her way and then met Hermione’s questioning glance with a wry smile. “My wife was… I guess you could say she’s been <em> disowned </em> by her family for marrying me… I am considered a blood-traitor and all. Callidora’s taken it hard. They were close. Anyway, she took the delegation so she could have a reason to see us. Otherwise, she might be disowned as well, just for associating with us.”</p><p>“Oh, how tragic…” Hermione murmured. “I know the Blacks are quite staunch about <em> blood purity </em>. It’s very sad.”</p><p>Septimus gave her a strange look. “I’m probably not the best person to bring it up but… is your friend Alphard the same? Many people find it odd, the two of you getting on so well.”</p><p>“I- Well, <em> no </em>, he’s not like that at all. I’m also surprised he hasn’t been disowned as well, as open to muggle culture as he is.”</p><p>That comment seemed to brighten Septimus’ disposition. “I have so many ideas for ways that we might change the narrative about muggles. Wizardkind has been fed so many half-truths about muggles, that they’re dirty, barbaric, evil… even power-hungry. But I’ve thought that if there was a way to introduce and even <em> immerse </em> wizards into their culture, perhaps there would less fear.”</p><p>“I heartily agree,” Hermione replied with a smile. “Would you like to get together and discuss it when we return to London?”</p><p>Septimus grinned. “I would love nothing better… and I would so <em> love </em> for you to meet my wife as well, and my son, Bilius. He’s ten months old now.”</p><p>Hermione realized that Ron’s father, Arthur, wouldn’t be born for two more years. How strange, to find herself thrown so far back in time. “Let us plan to do that, then. I’m afraid I find London society to be a bit cold. I could use some friendly acquaintances, particularly those who are of the same mind. Unfortunately, I’ve made quite a few enemies since moving there.”</p><p>“I don’t doubt that at all, Miss Dumbledore. Britain can be quite an unfriendly place for muggle activists like ourselves. But we can take pride in knowing that we are shaping the world for the better.”</p><p>Hermione instantly felt so at home in the presence of Septimus Weasley. He was warm and kind, and it almost gave her the feeling of being back in the Burrow again. </p><p>After a light lunch at the inn, they were escorted by thestral carriage to the site of the assembly. In downtown Plovdiv, which coincidentally, was the oldest city in Europe, there was a first-century Roman amphitheatre, one of the best preserved in the world, The Roman Amphitheatre of Philippopolis. It was used for gladiatorial games and was used as the seat of the General Assembly of Thrace until the fourth century. </p><p>When magical creatures or wizards walked through the eastern stone wall of the amphitheatre, they were magically transported into the wizarding district of Plovdiv, which revealed a magically concealed section of the amphitheatre. Hermione was blown away. There, on the ancient stone seats, sat delegates sent from nearly every magical government in the world. The entire delegation of the International Confederation of Wizards. It was hard not to feel overwhelmed and a bit intimidated. </p><p>Septimus leaned down and nudged her with a smile. “Come. We are seated beside the French delegation.”</p><p>Hermione nodded and followed, eyes wide as she gazed over the diverse and immense crowd of witches and wizards.</p><p>For the first evening, various speakers held the floor for the commencements, giving welcome speeches and casting vision for the future of the ICW. Then, each delegate was given the opportunity to introduce themselves and give a brief statement. When Hermione introduced herself, there were murmurs throughout the crowd, which gave her more than a little bit of anxiety.</p><p>When she was once again seated and feeling quite apprehensive, Septimus leaned over and muttered, “Everyone has been deeply curious about Dumbledore’s daughter. Don’t allow it to intimidate you.”</p><p>By the end of the first night, Hermione was exhausted and fell right into bed. The next day had a full agenda and she wanted to be well-rested and mentally prepared.</p><p>In the morning, she had breakfast with Septimus along with a very quiet and reserved Callidora Longbottom. Then, they once again joined the delegates at the assembly at Philippopolis. </p><p>Hermione was introduced to the French delegation and befriended a rather roguish Pureblooded wizard by the name of Caesar Rousseau, who became rather fixated on winning Hermione’s attention. Hermione was entirely befuddled as to why so many wizards wanted her attention in 1948; she chalked it up to being Dumbledore’s daughter. </p><p>The morning agenda dealt with various breaches of the Statute of Secrecy in many nations. In Italy, a duel gone awry had seen an entire village and several muggle vineyards destroyed by Fiendfyre. There were debates among several delegations as to whether the curse, with its unpredictability and potential for great devastation, should be made into an unforgivable. The Confederation filed it away and set a date for a hearing next quarter, which would eventually lead to the drafting of legislation that would be put to a vote.</p><p>Hermione watched as the beautiful and elegant Supreme Mugwump, Vicencia Santos, gracefully transitioned between the orders of business. </p><p>There were talks about magical creatures; muggle sightings of the Loch Ness monster had Scotland in a tizzy. There were votes on Veela rights and mermaid jurisdiction. The Mermaid population off the coast of Monte Carlo was unwilling to be regulated by the French Ministry of Magic, but several recent romantic entanglements between muggles and mermaids had caused a mess for the Confederation. That took quite a while to settle and ended up being set for a hearing at a later date. Hermione learned a great deal about the various task forces implemented by the Confederation, however, and she vowed to study mermaid culture more in-depth.</p><p>A Lobbyist group from Iceland presented a compelling case for the vicyskewt, a magical creature that was reaching the verge of extinction due to being hunted by Vampire for the magical properties of their blood. The campaign was led by Leikur Vörðursson, the gamekeeper at Töfraskóli Academy, the Icelandic School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.</p><p>Vampires certainly seemed to be the villains of the hour, as the entire delegation seemed to be aflutter with news of a vampire coven in Albania which were killing muggles at an alarming rate. A task force was being issued to tamp down on the murders, which were quite grisly.</p><p>Another order of business that was addressed during the assembly was the teaching of the dark arts at Durmstrang. Being the host country, the Bulgarian delegation seemed to be very put out with the inference that their school was being used to groom dark wizards.</p><p>Hermione was pleased when the school was given an official warning by the confederation. It was true, after all, that Grindelwald himself had attended Durmstrang. Even in Hermione’s time, the Headmaster would be a former Death Eater. The school also refused to admit Muggle-borns, which Hermione thought was an absolute abhorrence and should also be addressed. She was secretly thankful to have been able to attend Hogwarts. </p><p>By the end of the day, Hermione was completely knackered. Septimus invited her to the cultural district of Kapana for drinks that evening, along with some of Europe’s other delegates, and Hermione acquiesced, although she determined not to stay out too late, as the next day would be even more full and had promised to start bright and early.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Tom stood in his flat on Tuesday evening, staring out the window overlooking Knockturn Alley. Rather than apparate immediately to Albania, he’d owled Mulciber and requested the accommodation details for the British delegation of the ICW assembly in Bulgaria. He stood sipping a cup of coffee and staring at the bit of parchment which bore the address of the inn where Hermione would be staying.</p><p>Another one of his strong compulsions, which had grown stronger of late and<em> was growing </em> stronger by the day, was to know exactly where Hermione was at all times. He didn’t always care to be near her or to even interact with her, but he had to know <em> precisely </em> where she was for his own peace of mind. </p><p>Ever since his conversation with the ghost, his desire to visit Albania was growing less and less pressing, and his hunger to study soul bonds was becoming insatiable. </p><p>Still, he’d taken off work to go, so he would have to go at least for the remainder of the week. But for this evening… he had a choice. He could either stay in London and study for the night, or he could go see her in Bulgaria. </p><p>The drive to see her was <em> insistent </em> . He wanted to see for himself if he would again feel that tether between their souls. He’d felt it every time he saw her, since the moment they’d met, but now that the seer had put it in certain terms… <em> Twin flames </em> … it made it that much more glaringly obvious. He had felt that silver cord tethering them. Tom was hesitant to believe in something so trite and hackneyed but deep within himself, he knew it to be true. He didn’t know <em> how </em> he knew… only that he did know with almost frightening certainty that there was some sort of soul connection between them.</p><p>He felt such a magnetic pull toward this witch, an attraction of almost epic proportions. He found everything about her enthralling; his obsessiveness had absolutely no bounds. </p><p>He’d even considered using memory charms on Alphard Black, or a well-placed <em>imperius</em> curse to keep him away from her. But he’d decided at the last minute that he didn’t need to resort to those methods. </p><p>She was his and she’d already admitted as much. Tom just simply hadn’t pushed the matter. He’d given her space and allowed her free reign for months. He was a patient man, after all. He usually preferred to attract things to him. But his patience was growing thin, his questions needed answering, and knowing now that there was some kind of connection between them magically made it all that much more enticing. He had already determined that she would be his before he’d learned of the soul connection, but to know that she was his soulmate and that their magic would be significantly enhanced by one another… that was just the lemon drop on top of it all.</p><p>Tom wanted her…</p><p>… and he would <em> have </em> her.</p><p>He stared down at the address on the parchment. Suddenly, his rational and impulsive sides were at war with one another. </p><p>Tom made a snap decision, turned on his heel, and apparated with a click. </p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Tom stood on the street outside her hotel in Plovdiv. He was getting better at apparating large distances without getting sick, but this jaunt happened to be nearly sixteen hundred miles and he couldn’t escape the overwhelming urge to vomit. He withdrew his cigarette case and lighter and lit a cigarette. The taste of the tobacco helped to curb his nausea. </p><p>The hotel sat on a hill. An incomplete moon enveloped the sky, her transient halo creating several varying tones of darkness, the truest of those seeming almost a feeling rather than a shade, being the inexplicable black silhouettes of buildings against moonlit clouds. The outer ring of the moon’s halo was pinkish, the iris of heaven's eye, framed by the perfectly tiered echelons of Plovdiv’s city skyline. </p><p>An air of anticipation completed the picture as Tom stood erect, gazing out over the city.  A breeze blew against his face, moving his hair.  He closed his eyes out of habit.  The frothy currents of the wind were mournful and lonely.</p><p>Not totally succumbed to the revelry of the moment, Tom had for several moments been permeated by a faint feeling of being watched.  He opened his eyes slowly, head still upraised, his right hand in his pocket; he turned his head this way and that as if relaxing his neck muscles.  Then he saw her.</p><p>She was there, standing on the bloody sidewalk, as if he'd drawn her there with his magic. </p><p>It was amazing, the blast of feeling he received from her seeing her standing there, completely frozen.  She was staring at him and had been for several seconds.  Her face was confused and amazed, even a little afraid.  </p><p>She must have been coming from somewhere down the street, as she was flanked by a red-haired wizard who looked to be in his early thirties. Tom wondered acidly why this witch always seemed to have another wizard by her side.</p><p>He raised his cigarette once more to his lips, inhaling snappishly, and then jerked it away again.  He kept eye contact with her as he violently ejected the smoke. </p><p>“Are you coming, Hermione?” her red-headed companion asked.</p><p>Her eyes never left Tom.</p><p>“Um-” she stumbled over her words. “Go on without me. I’ll make my way up later.”</p><p>Her companion eyed Tom warily, but did as she asked.</p><p>It was a suspension, an object hanging in the air that they both wanted a piece of, and were equally afraid that the other would reach first.  It was not romantic. The tension between them was rife with polarity and the promise of violence. </p><p>This needed to be settled, Tom decided. Otherwise, they would continue to dance around one another for several more months. No, he needed to take control. </p><p>When Tom smiled at her, it was slow and sinister.</p><p>She regained her composure and approached, staring at him coldly. “Tom,” she breathed. “How did you get here?”</p><p>Smoke billowed from between his lips. “I apparated.”</p><p>Her brows furrowed. “You… apparated? How long did it take you?”</p><p>He smirked. “I came in one trip.”</p><p>Her eyes widened to the size of saucers. “<em> One trip </em>? But that’s… but it’s got to be more than a thousand miles?”</p><p>“Sixteen hundred, approximately.”</p><p>“Holy cricket! How are you not splinched?” She took a step back and looked him over, up and down in disbelief.</p><p>He laughed breathily. “Hermione.”</p><p>Her eyes met his. He knew she disliked when he said her name, which was precisely the reason he said it. The intimacy of it made her uncomfortable.</p><p>He wanted her to be nervous. He found her apprehension tremendously arousing.</p><p>He sucked smoke into his lungs. “Can I come up?”</p><p>Her mouth fell open. “What- um… to my <em> suite </em>?”</p><p>He ran his tongue over his top teeth and nodded, saying nothing.</p><p>Her mouth snapped shut and she swallowed. </p><p>Just to fuck with her, he leaned in and whispered, “Just say yes. It’s not hard.”</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. “I have the assembly early tomorrow morning.”</p><p>“I’ll be gone by then,” he pressed in an alluring voice, a voice he knew she wouldn’t favor. He inhaled smoke once more for the sake of a nonchalance he did not feel and she did not acknowledge. "It's not like I can apparate again for a bit, anyway."</p><p>"Okay," she said, barely an utterance.</p><p>Tom’s black eyes bore into hers as he leaned down and whispered, “Lead the way, little witch.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Tom followed Hermione through the hotel and up to her suite. He didn’t touch her. He didn’t have to. She felt his eyes burning along her skin as they walked.</p><p>Hermione flicked her wand and entered the room with Tom on her heels.</p><p>She had no idea what she was doing. She had no idea why he was there.</p><p>All she knew is that his presence caused a deep thrill in the pit of her stomach.</p><p>He’d caught her off-guard. She had no time to plan, to formulate the proper reaction. Now, she was just winging it, which was dangerous.</p><p>As she crossed the room, there was a loud rap on her window. A big snowy owl sat outside her window with a letter in its beak. “Oh, hello there!” She opened the window and took the letter. “Thank you, kindly.” She rubbed its feathers and checked to see who the letter was from.</p><p>She turned as she read the letter. She looked up and found Tom leaning against the doorway. “It’s from Supreme Mugwump Santos. She wants to have dinner with me tomorrow evening.”</p><p>Tom said nothing. His eyes went trailing down her form. </p><p>Hermione was surprised by how normal it felt for him to be here as if he hadn’t just rudely intruded upon her.</p><p>His presence was both alarming and comforting.</p><p>“I’m sure it’s just because I’m Dumbledore’s daughter, of course. Everyone seems to be murmuring… they’re all so <em> bloody </em> curious about Dumbledore’s offspring.”</p><p>At that, Tom crossed the room and took the letter from her hands, and set it on the desk by the window. Then he turned his penetrating gaze on her. “You’re a force, Hermione. It doesn’t matter why they're looking, or what drew their attention. While they’re looking, you’d better blow them away. Shock them all. Give them a <em> reason </em> to murmur.” He smirked. </p><p>She gazed up at Tom and found his bottomless obsidian eyes burning through her.</p><p>Something within Hermione was crumbling. It had been crumbling since the moment they’d met. Hermione felt as though she were trying desperately to keep a jenga tower from toppling. It was absolutely hopeless.</p><p>His hand moved to take her chin between his thumb and forefinger. Her eyes fell shut as he lowered his face to hers. He stopped just before their lips met and breathed her name. It sent a shiver down her spine. His breath was hot on her lips and smelled like tobacco and spearmint… then, he kissed her.</p><p>The kiss felt like sweet relief. Like the pelting of a hot shower on sore muscles. Like sinking into one’s own soft bed at the end of an exhausting day.  It felt so <em> right </em>. The taste of him was euphoric, like an instant burst of serotonin into her veins.</p><p>Hermione released her breath through her nose in a soft sigh.  In the same instant, he sucked in a breath. His arms wrapped tightly around her, his long fingers stroking her lower back gently.</p><p>Then all at once, Hermione came to her senses. Like a cold bucket of water had been dumped on her, she remembered who he <em> was </em> and the weight of that realization came crashing down upon her.</p><p>With an angry gasp, she pulled away, breaking the kiss sharply as she pushed against his chest, shoving him away. </p><p>She backed away until her legs hit the bed. She caught her breath as she stared at him.</p><p>He reached a hand up and brushed his thumb over his bottom lip, eyes narrowing in surprise.</p><p>“You can’t just come here and kiss me, Tom,” she muttered in frustration.</p><p>“Of course, I can,” he said coldly. “You’re mine.”</p><p>Her mouth fell open in surprise. “You- You can’t just… You can’t just claim to <em> own </em> someone, Tom!”</p><p>He smirked and issued a caustic laugh. “I’m not <em> claiming </em> anything. You said it yourself. You <em> belong </em> to me.”</p><p>“I- But- That…”</p><p>His eyebrows lifted, and the corners of his lips turned up in amusement. “Yes?”</p><p>She looked at him coldly. “I still think you had me under a spell.”</p><p>“Is that what you’re telling yourself, <em> Hermione </em>?”</p><p>She rolled her eyes, exasperated. “I don’t have time for this. I’m <em> very </em> busy-”</p><p>“Did you enjoy your little kiss with Alphard Black?” Tom interrupted.</p><p>She froze. “How did you know about that?”</p><p>His expression was icy. “Doesn’t matter. I think it’s time you explain yourself.”</p><p>Shock painted her features. “Explain <em> what </em> exactly? Everyone knows that we’ve been… seeing each other.”</p><p>His jaw tensed. He stared at her for several seconds, warring with his composure and self-control. Then he spoke. “Look me in the eye and tell me you lied to me.”</p><p>“Lied to you about <em> what </em>?”</p><p>His black eyes were absolutely feral. Hermione had never seen Tom Riddle this way. He was always so cold and aloof, so composed and calculating, so fluid and charming. She had never seen him look this… <em> vicious </em> . As if he were struggling to keep his composure. “You said you were mine, little witch. You said you belonged to <em> me </em> . I already know you’re a liar, Hermione… but I want to hear it from your own lips that you were lying about <em> that </em> . Perhaps, I’ll believe you, if you lie <em> really sweetly </em> to me.”</p><p>Hermione’s mouth fell open. “That was before I found out you’d been sleeping with Walburga Black for <em> six years </em> and didn’t tell me! Don’t you remember? The woman who tried to murder me that night?”</p><p>Tom’s eyes snapped with rage. He closed the distance between them and gripped her shoulders. “You avoided me for two fucking months, Hermione. Every time <em> anything </em> happens between us, you <em> fucking </em> disappear. It’s not like we had any golden opportunities to have a little chat over drinks about each and every previous piece of ass I’ve ever shagged in my life!”</p><p>Hermione scowled at him venomously. “Six years? That is not <em> just </em> a piece of ass, Tom.”</p><p>“It was for me.”</p><p>Hermione breathed heavily and swallowed. “That’s quite cruel, Tom.”</p><p>He shook his head. “No, it isn’t. She knew what it was from the beginning. I <em> never </em> pretended that it was anything <em> but </em>. I told the bitch she was a cumsock and she kept coming back for more. That’s not my bloody issue, is it?”</p><p>Hermione looked at him derisively. “And I’m to believe that what happened between us is something <em> different? </em> She tried to kill me, Tom. How many other women are out there pining for you?”</p><p>He set his jaw, nostrils flaring. His black eyes were a roaring fire of anger. “What she imagined in her own foolish head is not my problem, Hermione. I warned her to stay away from you. I had no way of knowing she would do what she did. If I thought for even a second that she would try to harm you, I would’ve strangled her with my own two hands. Not that I’d need to. You can clearly take care of yourself.”</p><p>“You’d <em> strangle </em> her? A girl you had a relationship with for <em> six years </em>? That’s a terrible thing to say, Tom.”</p><p>He shook his head. “Doesn’t matter to me, it’s the truth. Better her dead than you.”</p><p>Hermione ripped herself out of his hands. “None of this matters. You and I together is a <em> terrible </em> idea.”</p><p>He scoffed. “And I suppose Alphard Black is the better choice?”</p><p>“I think so.”</p><p>His jaw muscles rippled, eyes narrowing menacingly. “If you think I’m letting you run off on me again, you’re fucking delusional, Hermione.”</p><p>She stepped up to his chest, her lips pulled tight. “What are you going to do, Riddle? Chain me up? What the fuck do you <em> want </em> from me? Why can’t you leave me alone?”</p><p>Tom smiled coldly. He stepped forward until they were face to face, and his voice was a smooth, intoxicating poison. “Oh, no. I’ve already told you what I want. In great detail, might I add. I think it’s your turn. What do <em> you </em> want, Hermione? Do you want Alphard Black?” He laughed; a deep, frightening sound. “No. You don’t want him. You <em> want </em> yourself to want him. But you don’t, and it bothers you. It bothers you because he fits in with your little life you think you’re crafting, your perfect glass castle. I don’t fit your little dreams, do I, Hermione? You want to believe all the things he said about me, because I frighten you. My magic scares you… But I think you <em> like </em> being frightened. I think Alphard Black fucking bores you, and I think I <em> wake you up </em>.”</p><p>Hermione was dumbstruck.</p><p>Silence stretched between them.</p><p>He glared at her, his eyes combing her body as if he were seeing it for the first time. “How did it feel to have his hands on you after what we did? ‘Mine, not his.’ <em> Right </em>?”</p><p>Tears sprung into Hermione’s eyes. “How do you think <em> I </em> felt, Tom? I let you in. Against my own <em> better </em> judgment… more than I’ve <em> ever </em> let anyone in before. And in the <em> same night </em> , I’m blindsided and I have to picture you <em> fucking </em> Walburga Black, of <em> all people. </em> Six years of you and her together… replaying over and over in my mind all night… all <em> week </em> . I felt sick. It’s like I let myself believe you were someone different than you really are. I’m only thankful that Alphard reminded me of the <em> truth </em>.”</p><p>His pupils dilated as he shook his head.. “You could’ve come to me about what Black said. I could’ve explained everything about Walburga.” He smirked bitterly. “Instead, you chose to play the vindictive little witch that we both know you are. Do you think I’ll let you toy with me the way you toy with Black?”</p><p>Her lips parted. “That isn’t fair, Tom.”</p><p>“What <em> is </em> fair, then, little witch? Grinding yourself on my fingers with my name on your lips, and then kissing another wizard a week later with those same lips? Is that your idea of fair?” He looked at her coldly, his black eyes snapping with ice-cold fury. “Do you enjoy having all these men falling at your feet? Do you enjoy them begging for your affection, little whore? I’m fucking tired of hearing Abraxas pining after you. Would you like me to round up the rest of my pureblooded friends for you, so you can try them all one by one? Perhaps all of Slytherin house as well? I’m sure you and Walburga could compare notes.”</p><p>“<em> Excuse </em> me? How <em> dare </em> you!” she shouted, her voice shrill. Before she realized what she was doing, she hauled back and slapped his cheek with ten times more power than she’d hit Draco with in third year.</p><p>Tom stood very still, every bit like a statue, face still turned to the side. His jaw tensed with anger. Hermione watched with horror as her handprint turned red on his cheek.</p><p>“<em> Crucio </em>!”</p><p>Blinding pain. For a moment, all Hermione felt was a searing, sharp burning in every part of her body. It crawled along her skin like a thousand tiny glass shards piercing her skin, slicing her muscles, ripping her insides out. Her heart pounded with intense agony. She screamed, collapsing onto the edge of the bed. </p><p>Then, all at once the pain stopped.</p><p>Then she felt Tom’s arms wrap around her, his lips crashing onto hers. </p><p>Hermione whimpered against his lips, panting in the aftereffects of the torture curse, but she was soon breathless for an entirely different reason. His hands were everywhere, on her breasts, stroking her stomach, gripping her thighs and prying them apart, lifting her skirt, as if he were attempting to brand her everywhere with his touch.</p><p>Her body was all the more sensitive due to the curse he’d just cast, her nerve endings raw and on fire as his skin dragged along hers, scorching her everywhere their bodies touched. It took her mind a moment to catch up. She choked back a sob, but to her surprise, her body welcomed him as if she were a starving woman. A traitorous hunger flooded her body, a pulsing need building between her legs. His tongue invaded her mouth, prying her lips apart, and she allowed him in. She tried to deny him, to find some shred of willpower but her mind simply wouldn’t function properly. His mouth snatched at hers hungrily and Hermione involuntarily moaned, feeling his erection hard against her thigh.</p><p>He gripped her thighs and slid her back to the middle of the bed, forcing her legs apart with his knees. His hand tightened in her curls, winding her wild locks around his fingers as he yanked her head back and his lips found her throat. He bit her throat violently, then his tongue swiped over the mark, soothing the raw skin. </p><p>“Hermione,” he breathed against her skin. “What are you doing to me?”</p><p>Her heart pounded wildly. <em> Voldemort </em> was kissing her. <em> Voldemort </em> was grinding himself against her, his cock hard in his trousers… and the worst part was that she wanted him to.</p><p>Hermione had never been intimate with anyone, ever, and yet in this moment, desperation clawed its way up through her and she had no more stamina left to resist it.</p><p>Alphard didn’t matter. Their argument didn’t matter. The curse didn’t matter. Walburga didn’t matter.</p><p>All that mattered was his skin on her skin.</p><p>His hand wandered beneath her skirt and between her legs, then slid her knickers to the side, his long fingers brushing against her entrance. The slightest touch of his fingertips drove her crazy and she arched her back, needing more.</p><p>Harry would hate her.</p><p>Ron would despise her.</p><p>But Harry and Ron… they weren’t <em> here </em>.</p><p>“I curse you and yet, you’re still so wet for me.” His voice was dark and commanding against the shell of her ear. “Perhaps my little witch enjoys pain.”</p><p>“Do you enjoy hurting me, Tom?” she gasped.</p><p>“Only when you deserve it, darling.” His voice was rough and hoarse with hunger. His mouth covered hers again, slanting across her lips as his tongue moved forcefully against her own. <em> Merlin </em>, this man could kiss.</p><p>“Hermione,” he whispered as he unzipped his pants, withdrawing his cock. Her eyes widened and she carefully averted her gaze, looking <em> anywhere </em> else, because if she looked at the size of him, she would lose her nerve. “I’ve thought about being inside you since the day I met you in Diagon Alley.”</p><p>He pinned her wrists above her head, holding them there in an iron grip with one hand. With his other hand, he dragged his index finger along her wet entrance.</p><p>“Please,” she moaned, pressing herself against him hungrily. She was half out of her mind, barely aware of her actions. All she knew was that she needed <em> more </em> . His smell engulfed her, the subtle scent of <em> Tom </em> that she found so intoxicating.</p><p>“You beg so <em> nicely </em>,” he murmured. In their lust, they abandoned undressing. He leaned down, his lips brushing against her hair. “You’re mine, Hermione. You belong to me.”</p><p>She shook her head. “No,” she whispered. </p><p>“<em> Yes </em>,” he breathed. “Say my name.”</p><p>She breathed heavily, struggling against him, but his grip on her wrists was unbreakable, and his weight pinned her down.</p><p>“Say it.”</p><p>“Tom,” she whispered, thrusting her hips forward to meet his. The head of his cock pressed against her entrance, teasing her maddeningly. </p><p>“One day, you’ll speak my real name.” He leaned closer and whispered, “Voldemort… that’s who I am. You don’t know him yet. But you will.”</p><p><em>Oh, yes, I do,</em> Hermione thought.<em> I know him very well, the prick.</em></p><p>His eyes met hers, and without ceremony, he entered her. </p><p>She screamed at the sudden feeling of fullness. He was so <em> big </em>. Pain and pleasure both ripped through her and she half sobbed, half moaned. </p><p>He whispered, “Shh,” against her hair as he began to move, massaging away the dull pain gently. She realized it would always be this way with him. Both pain and pleasure.</p><p>She wanted them both. She knew it was the only way she could have him. </p><p>And she <em> wanted </em> him.</p><p>Tom gripped her cheeks, turning her face to his. “Eyes on me.”</p><p>He moved slowly and gently. After a bit, the dull ache gave way to waves of heat building in her core, she began to arch against him, meeting his thrusts with fervor of her own.</p><p>He murmured against her hair, a stream of praise that lit her body on fire and made her moan, halfway out of her mind.</p><p>“You feel so fucking good, Hermione.”</p><p>“So soft and tight. I want to live inside you.”</p><p>“Your skin is fucking exquisite.”</p><p>“You’re mine… I’m going to show you how powerful you are, little witch.”</p><p>Her skin flushed pink beneath his praise.</p><p>He ripped open her blouse, popping the buttons, and pushed her bra up her chest. His mouth covered her breast, tongue circling her nipple, flicking and biting down gently. She arched against him, whimpering softly. His chuckle was like fire against her skin, his deep voice causing hot reverberations through her core.</p><p>Hermione thought she might die from the pleasure of it… once the discomfort faded, she began to thrill in the warm, hot feeling of his cock inside her. Everything was so new and foreign to her. His hardness and the friction, oh, gods, the <em> friction </em> was like nothing she’d ever felt before. Not only that but there was something else that stirred between them, some energy, like the feeling of their magic merging, and it was more euphoric than any elixir. Hermione thought with some alarm that she might not be able to stop this now that they’d started.</p><p>She would want this again and again.</p><p>He reached between them and she felt his fingertips on her clit, rubbing maddening circles around the sensitive spot. </p><p>“Oh, fuck,” she moaned loudly. The grin that spread across his face was sinister and his eyes shifted to blazing red.</p><p>That frightened her.</p><p>For a moment, she thought she could almost see the shadow of the man who had tried to murder her best friend.</p><p>“Please don’t become him,” she whispered softly into his shoulder, tears filling her eyes. “<em> Please… </em>”</p><p>Tom’s eyebrows drew forward and he pulled back. “What did you say?”</p><p>“Nothing,” she muttered, shaking her head, but the unexpected tears spilled over anyway. </p><p>He paused, ceasing his thrusts as he watched the tears trickle down her cheeks.</p><p>Then, very slowly, he began to move again, and he leaned forward, his tongue lapping at the salty wetness on her cheeks. </p><p>“Your tears drive me mad, Hermione. You have no fucking <em> idea </em> what that does to me.”</p><p>He moved faster, his thrusts punishing, but she welcomed them, spreading her legs wider and pulling him deeper with her ankles around his waist.</p><p>His fingers had steadily kept their ministrations on her clit, and she marveled at the way he knew just the right tempo to take. Slow, then steadily quicker. Then slowly again. Then, much quicker and rougher.</p><p>She moaned loudly as she felt herself lifted into a place where her body and mind were separate. She hardly noticed the pain anymore for the raw pleasure pounding through her, spreading through her abdomen, pulsing where his fingers rubbed her clit. “Oh, fuck, Tom,” she whimpered, losing all inhibition. “Please, harder.”</p><p>That drove him crazy, her begging. His teeth grazed her shoulder as he fucked her even more roughly, his movements growing wild and unhinged. The hand that held her wrists moved to her throat and rested there, not tightly, but in ownership, like a collar around her throat.</p><p>“You’re mine,” he whispered in her ear, like a prayer. “I own you. You belong to me.” He said it over and over, chanting it with every thrust.</p><p>“No one can… own… another person…” she gasped out, the tension building in her body becoming unbearable. </p><p>He chuckled darkly, his lips brushing her hair as he muttered in her ear, “I wonder, darling, do you lie to yourself as much as you lie to me?”</p><p>He leaned back and his eyes met hers. She became lost in their black depths, falling, falling, allowing herself to be lost in the black holes of his soul. Her mouth fell open, her walls tightening, and she arched her back as she felt herself reaching the precipice of something…</p><p>“Come for me, Hermione. Let me watch you.” His long fingers flexed, tightening around her throat, applying light pressure; she could feel the cold metal of his ring against her jugular. Then Hermione cried out as the building pressure finally exploded and she came, hard, her entire body pulsing with waves of pleasure as he fucked her through the force of the orgasm. She gasped, sucking in an asphyxiated breath.</p><p>Tom watched her come, his eyes roaming her hungrily, taking in the violent red that spread across her chest, the way she held her breath as it washed over her… he watched her pupils contracting, legs quivering slightly, her breathing finally growing jagged, the way she arched back, jaw slack, gripping the sheet until her knuckles turned white and then-</p><p>“Fuck.” He ejected a heavy breath as he came as well, his cock hardening and then pulsing inside her. Hermione gasped as she felt him filling her with his warm spend, but she felt oddly satisfied by it, her walls involuntarily tensing around him. He breathed her name as he thrust gently through his release. He gazed down at her, his black curls falling messily over dark, glazed eyes. Sweat beaded on his temple.</p><p>He shook his head and then muttered breathlessly, “<em> Fuck </em> you, Hermione.”</p><p>She brushed her fingertips along his sharp cheekbone. She understood his hatred all too well. “You just did, asshole.”</p><p>He laughed, a wide grin spreading across his face.</p><p>In that moment, Hermione closed her eyes tightly as a terrifying truth dawned on her. She saw the tarot cards before her… the two skeletons entwined… the lovers… then the two of cups… </p><p>Indecision.</p><p>Conflict.</p><p>Soulmates.</p><p><em> I believe… he is an enemy </em>.</p><p>Madame Violette’s words echoed in her mind.</p><p>
<em> No… </em>
</p><p>Lord Voldemort… he couldn’t be… </p><p>…her soulmate. </p><p>That wasn’t <em> possible </em>.</p><p>Her heart stopped. Tom rolled over, pulling her with him. She blushed as she realized he was still inside her. He grabbed his wand from his trousers and flourished it, casting some kind of charm between them. Perhaps it was a contraception charm. She blushed, having not even <em> thought </em> of it.</p><p>Her thighs were sticky. It reminded her that she had been a virgin just over half an hour ago. She was afraid and a little embarrassed to point out that fact, so she reached for her wand to cast <em> scourgify </em> before he noticed the blood on the sheets, but he caught her wrist tightly in a bruising grip, forcing her to drop the wand. </p><p>“Leave it,” he warned.</p><p>She set her jaw and squirmed uncomfortably, but he refused to let her withdraw.</p><p>“I’m going to give you a warning, little witch. I’ll only say this once.” His eyes were cold. “If Alphard Black touches you again, I’ll kill him. I think you know that I don’t make idle threats. Handle his life with care.”</p><p>She stared down at him, not attempting to hide the trepidation in her eyes. He brushed his knuckles gently along her jaw. “Do what you will in public, Hermione. Wear his jewelry. Attend your fucking galas with him. Write about him in your column. Drag my name through the mud if you must. I don’t care who it is. Abraxas. Alphard. Whoever you decide to toy with for the week. But behind closed doors, you're my witch. <em> Mine </em> . You <em> belong </em> to me. No one fucking touches you but me.”</p><p>Hermione’s eyes searched his. An unfamiliar tenderness was setting in between her thighs, and her nerves were raw from the crucio he’d cast. He had only held it for a split second, but it was a <em> powerful </em> crucio. The well of power that this wizard commanded from his wand- nay, his very <em> fingertips </em>, was frightening. She feared ever truly being on the receiving end of his wrath.</p><p>“Curse me again and I’ll cut your dick off,” she whispered.</p><p>Tom laughed through his nose as he wrapped his arms around her, pulling her to his chest. “That would be rather inconvenient for you, don’t you think?”</p><p>She fought back a smile. “On the contrary, I think it might solve most of my problems.”</p><p>He laughed. “Alright. Deal, little witch.”</p><p>Trembling, she lay her head on his chest, with his fingers tangled in her hair, and fell asleep. <br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
Hermione woke from a dream. She opened her eyes to deep darkness.<br/>
<br/>
For a moment, she wasn't sure where she was. </p><p>She tried to remember the dream, but it evaded her.<br/>
<br/>
As she became more lucid, she wondered if she'd dreamt it all.<br/>
<br/>
Had Tom Riddle really apparated to Bulgaria to see her? It seemed so far-fetched and strange. </p><p>She turned in the darkness and reached out to confirm that she had truly dreamt everything.</p><p>Her hand fell upon a hard, warm body. She slid her hands over the planes of lean muscle.<br/>
<br/>
Her hands trembled. She felt a dull ache between her thighs, confirming that she hadn't imagined it.</p><p>It had actually happened. She'd slept with Tom Riddle.</p><p>No... she had given him her<em> V card</em>.</p><p>What the <em>actual fuck</em>?</p><p>How had this happened? It had occurred so quickly, within an hour of his arrival.</p><p>This man was a very skilled manipulator. He'd caught her off guard.</p><p>Long fingers wrapped around her wrist, and she caught her breath.</p><p>She couldn't see his face in the darkness.</p><p>He pulled her against him, wrapping his arms around her.</p><p>He'd taken his clothes off. She was still dressed, but her shirt had been ripped wide. She felt the heat of his skin against her chest.</p><p>Her cheeks grew hot; she was thankful for the darkness which obscured them.</p><p>"You're here," she whispered. "I thought I'd dreamt it."</p><p>"No, little witch," he murmured. </p><p>His fingers brushed her cheek.<br/>
<br/>
They lay in silence, engulfed by the darkness. The only thing she heard was the amplified sounds of their breathing.</p><p>"Go to sleep, Hermione."</p><p>She pressed her face against his chest, breathing in the delicious scent of him.</p><p>Tom's fingertips stroked her spine softly.</p><p>Hermione's eyes fell shut, and she drifted off into a peaceful sleep.</p><p><br/>

</p><p align="center"> </p><p>The soft heat of sunlight played patterns across Hermione’s eyelids.  A lazy stretch accompanied her drowsy ascent to consciousness. Her body woke languidly, feeling the energetic lethargy of a late morning rise: the sleep in the eyes, light mist of oil around the nose, the gentle insistence of the sun…</p><p>Hermione sat straight up. The previous night came rushing back all at once. She checked her watch, which was still on her wrist from the night before, then she released a breath of relief. There was still an hour and a half until she would need to be at the assembly.</p><p>Hermione looked around. Tom was nowhere to be found, but his clothes were laid on the chair by the bed. </p><p>Her face twisted into one of incredulity. </p><p><em> Tom Riddle’s clothes are laying in my hotel room, </em>she thought.</p><p>She craned her head and could just barely make out the sound of water.</p><p>Tom Riddle was <em>showering </em>in her hotel room.</p><p>Tom.</p><p>Marvolo.</p><p><em>Fucking</em>.</p><p>Riddle.</p><p>Hermione twisted her lips to the side wryly. This was certainly a shitstorm she’d gotten herself into.</p><p>She glanced at the sheets, but they were crisp and clean. </p><p>Thank <em> Merlin</em>.</p><p>Hermione promptly extricated her ruined blouse from her body and fell back onto the bed, throwing a hand over her eyes. What on earth had she done?</p><p>Well, it was pretty obvious what she’d done.</p><p>She’d fucked Tom Riddle.</p><p>Well, he’d fucked <em> her</em>, truth be told.</p><p>She couldn’t even blame it on the alcohol. She hadn’t even drunk very much last night.</p><p>“Oh, <em> Merlin</em>,” she breathed.</p><p>“Are we feeling regretful?”</p><p>Hermione sat bolt upright at the sudden intrusion of Tom’s voice. She gripped the sheet and held it against her chest. He was crossing the room from the bathroom, his black curls glistening and wet with a sheen of moisture over his chest.</p><p>He was wearing only a towel.</p><p><em> Godric’s ghost</em>, he was fit.</p><p>Very fucking fit.</p><p>“No,” she murmured distractedly. She tried to tear her eyes away from the sight of him but it was like watching an automobile accident happen. She couldn’t <em>stop watching</em>.</p><p>The instant he reached the chair where his clothes lay, he dropped the towel.</p><p>Hermione instantly averted her eyes, looking down at her hands, at the window, at anything but a completely <em>nude </em> Tom Riddle.</p><p>What in <em>Salazar’s name </em>was happening?</p><p>After a few moments, she glanced back over at him, and to her relief, he’d donned his trousers and was currently buttoning his shirt. Finally, her eyes met his, and she found him staring at her with an unmistakable smirk on his face. His eyes were laughing as he looked down at her, seeming every bit like a pompous Julius Caesar, gazing out over his victory at the siege of Alesia.</p><p>“Are you going back to London?”</p><p>“No,” he replied.</p><p>Her eyebrows lifted. “You don’t have to work?”</p><p>“I took time off.”</p><p>“Oh,” she murmured. “Where <em> are </em> you going, then?”</p><p>His black eyes turned on her, skimming her where she sat beneath the sheet before he responded. “Albania.”</p><p>“What will you do in Albania?” <em> I know exactly what you’ll do, </em> she thought. <em> You’ll look for Ravenclaw’s diadem. </em></p><p>Was it too early for him to be searching for it? She couldn’t remember.</p><p>He smirked. “I have business there. Perhaps when you spill some of your secrets, I’ll let you in on some of mine.”</p><p>She set her jaw stubbornly. “I suppose we are at an impasse, then.”</p><p>He laughed. “I suppose we are.” His eyes narrowed and he tilted his head. "For now."</p><p>He was putting his cufflinks in, and Hermione, for some reason, thought it an obscenely, <em> attractively </em>masculine gesture. She bit her lip as she watched him.</p><p>“You bite that lip any harder, you’ll break skin.”</p><p>Her eyes snapped to his. He stood watching her with an amused expression. His robes sat on the chair but he didn’t make a move to wear them.</p><p>“How long will you be there? In Albania.”</p><p>“Until Sunday.”</p><p>She nodded. “I’m sorry, but… how did you know where I was? Staying, that is.”</p><p>Tom approached her where she sat on the bed. He was incredibly tall, and she felt dwarfed by his presence in the room. </p><p>“A secret for a secret, darling. Those are the rules.”</p><p>She scowled at him, drawing a chuckle from him.</p><p>He reached out and ran his thumb over her bottom lip.  “I’ll owl you when I’m back in London, Hermione.”</p><p>Then he stood back. “I'd say good luck with Santos, but I've got a feeling you're like myself. You don't need luck, do you?”</p><p>At that, he instantly apparated away.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p>Hermione could hardly focus on the proceedings at the assembly. She participated in discussions and pundits, and voted when her vote was required. She mingled politely with the other delegates. But in the back of her mind, all she could think about was the previous night with Tom Riddle.</p><p>Hermione wasn’t sure <em> what </em> she should think or feel.</p><p>Before last night, she’d been <em> sure </em> she was merely a game to Tom. Some distraction or toy like Walburga had been, or a political strategy to get her on his side, to use her influence for his cause. </p><p>But… if she was being honest, what was happening between them didn’t <em> feel </em> like any of that.</p><p>Of course, Hermione wasn’t stupid. Walburga had also convinced herself that <em> she </em> meant something to him. He was a skilled manipulator, and Hermione didn’t trust him in the least. He used people. Hermione knew this.</p><p>But, despite what Hermione knew in her mind to be true, her feelings were telling her an entirely different story. Her emotions were a hurricane of confusion and contradiction. She was experiencing a raging storm of desire, guilt, fear, jealousy, insecurity, and self-loathing.</p><p>There was just no processing what happened. Hermione felt like the internal gears and wheels of her brain had gone defunct.</p><p>What would happen now? What <em> should </em> happen now? She couldn’t very well keep seeing Alphard Black. Not after she’d quite literally handed her virginity to Tom Riddle on a silver platter.</p><p>She still couldn’t believe it. It was too surreal. What universe had Hermione been dropped into where this sort of thing could just… happen?</p><p>She felt as if she were trapped in some sort of enchantment or simulation. Was the object that sent her to 1948... an experiment of Voldemort’s?</p><p>Perhaps she was under the imperius curse and didn’t know it? </p><p>Since when did Hermione find a raging psychopathic serial killer <em>attractive</em>?</p><p>Merlin… she did find him <em> incredibly </em>attractive. </p><p>She sat on her stone seat, in the midst of the delegation, as the representative from Chile spoke, and she shook her head in bewilderment. Red crept up her neck and stained her cheeks as she thought about that night.</p><p>She had sex with Tom Riddle.</p><p>It had been mind-blowing.</p><p>Then they’d slept together… as in, they’d <em> cuddled</em>. In bed. <em>All night</em>.</p><p><em> No matter, </em> she thought. <em> It doesn’t mean I owe him anything. I’ve never professed any kind of loyalty to him. I’ll still fight him. In fact, I’ll fight against him even harder now, just to prove a point. </em></p><p>It also didn’t mean she would have sex with him again either. She hadn’t promised him anything. They weren’t <em> together</em>, by any means.</p><p>Although, after that night, it felt rather inevitable. Their union had been electric… like some tangible connection between them had been solidified. She thought perhaps the ache inside her would be satisfied now, but she only felt a hunger for <em>more</em>.</p><p>That was <em>not </em>good.</p><p>Not good <em>at all</em>.</p><p>Tom was right, of course. She did disappear every time something happened between them. She ran like a frightened child.</p><p>He had this uncanny ability to completely call her out on every pretense and facade she tried to maintain.</p><p>It was as if he… <em> knew </em> her. How was that possible? What was she missing? </p><p>Hermione sighed deeply, drawing a glance from Septimus. She gave him a tight smile, then diverted her gaze.</p><p>Perhaps this was her best way of getting close to him. The easiest way to kill him, to discover his secrets, and to find out where he kept his journal. </p><p>But… was Tom really her soulmate? </p><p>It couldn’t be true. That would be just so epically <em> cruel </em> of the universe to do that to her.</p><p>Especially when she’d sacrificed so much in her life to help others. <em> Why</em>? What had she done to deserve <em> this </em> torture?</p><p>Her first. Her first had been Tom Riddle.</p><p>That couldn't be right, could it? There was no way it had happened that way. With an argument and the <em>cruciatus</em> curse?</p><p>She’d always assumed it would be with Ron.</p><p>He'd been the only person she could imagine herself being so intimate with. She trusted him.</p><p>Hermione had always been so caught up in her mind, in her own mental processes, a complete brainiac, a know-it-all, a bookworm. Physicality was something she had always put on the back burner. She’d never allowed herself to go farther than she was comfortable with. She’d even put up walls with Viktor Krum, despite his every attempt to push past her defenses.</p><p>She’d often wondered if she were made of ice. Cold and unresponsive. She’d convinced herself that it was because she truly loved Ron, deep down... that she had merely been holding out for him.</p><p>Then, after the Battle, she’d iced over again.</p><p>She began to think she truly would end up an old maid… cleaving to her books, married to a career… forever an ice queen. </p><p>It wasn’t as if Hermione was incapable of love. She loved very deeply. She was intensely loyal, compassionate, and caring. </p><p>But when it came to passion and sexuality… she would almost always freeze up. She’d never understood <em>why</em>.</p><p>Well, that was <em>clearly</em> no longer an issue. But why did it have to be <em> Tom Riddle, </em> of all people?</p><p>She hadn't even had to think about it. There was no analyzing, researching, or studying involved. Stranger still, she hadn't even been nervous or apprehensive.</p><p>It just... happened.</p><p>Tom had pulled something out of Hermione that she didn’t recognize. A side of her that had lain dormant and buried… that she hadn’t known <em>existed </em>within herself.</p><p>She tried to pay attention to the speaker, but their words sounded muffled and far away.</p><p>Hermione was completely bumfuzzled. </p><p>Again, she saw Tom coming out of her bathroom, the towel around his waist, his hair and skin dripping wet. </p><p>Just the thought had her heart beating faster.</p><p>She tried to tell herself that it was his physical appearance that made her feel this way, but she knew it was a lie.</p><p>Hermione had never cared much for physical appearances. Physical attraction was usually more of an afterthought.</p><p>Krum had been handsome. Cormac had been handsome. Alphard Black was extremely good-looking. So much so that he even rivaled Tom's own attractiveness.</p><p>No... there was something <em>else</em> about Tom...</p><p>... more than just his sharp jawline, his brilliant teeth, his intoxicating smell, the obsidian black eyes that scorched her.</p><p>It was the way he interacted with her, it was his hunger for power and knowledge, his endearing love of reading...  his overwhelming <em>intensity</em> which matched Hermione's own.</p><p>There was something about Tom Riddle that drew her like a moth to a flame. She felt like he <em>saw</em> her.</p><p>She couldn't escape the feeling that they were the <em>same</em>, somehow.</p><p>It made absolutely no sense.</p><p>Ron had always cared about her. But she never felt like he really understood her.</p><p><em> Ok, so it’s past the point of feeling guilt and remorse, </em> she thought. <em> Because I am actively choosing this. That’s clear. I’ve always had a choice, and I’ve unfortunately chosen wrong… for whatever reason. So, the only thing I can do now to salvage this, is find a way to work this to my advantage. I can’t bow out now. I’m obviously in far too deep. </em></p><p>If Tom Riddle thought that she was going to bow down and worship at his feet, he had another thing coming. This changed <em>nothing</em>. He was her enemy, and he was also public enemy number one, as far as she was concerned. He was still a dark wizard who wanted to subjugate and assimilate the entire world beneath his cruel reign. She hated everything he stood for. She <em>would </em>find a way to undermine him, and perhaps this would give her the advantage she needed to do that exact thing.</p><p><em> It’s alright, Hermione. You’re only sleeping with the enemy. No big deal, </em> she thought.</p><p>She wouldn’t think about it anymore; not until she returned to London. If this was going to happen at all, she would need to learn to separate her feelings from her work. </p><p>Tom was right about one thing. </p><p>Hermione <em> was </em> a force.</p><p>He was going to find out how powerful she could be.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Zephyris’ voice rumbled in Tom’s ear. It was gravelly and possessed a depth that resembled the echoes of a rocky landslide in a deep, earthy canyon. </p><p>The half-giant was old. Tom wasn’t sure how old, but he was old enough to be thought dead by the majority of the wizarding world. The old alchemist was not dead, however. He was hidden away in his magical caves, awaiting the day when giants and wizards would rule the earth. </p><p>Tom had learned of him through an Albanian vampire at Borgin &amp; Burkes, and had been connected to him by his acquaintances amongst the giants. The fact that he was here, learning from the wizard was a miracle in itself. </p><p>Tom suspected that he may be one of the few wizards, besides himself, who had created a horcrux. His eyes glowed red like Riddle’s. Either that, or he had unearthed some ancient magic through his study of alchemy. Perhaps, something similar to the philosopher’s stone. Perhaps he’d even located the Fountain of Fair Fortune. </p><p>Or perhaps it was the very darkness itself which was preserving the old wizard’s life. Tom had never met another wizard who emanated dark magic as strongly as Zephyris did. Very few things frightened Tom, but the old wizard’s presence had every cell in Tom’s body on alert. His hackles were permanently raised. </p><p>Tom loved it. He wanted to one day instill such fear of his presence as well. </p><p>Tom had no taste for lesser pleasures. He cared little for food, for friendship, for a life of luxury and leisure. He had never envisioned a family or a career. What Tom sought was power. Immortality. To go so deeply into the depths of magic that he would never return the same.</p><p>He wanted to be overflowing with magic. He wanted to <em> become </em> magic; to harness the darkness itself until it permeated his very cellular framework.</p><p>Tom didn’t desire to simply be Tom.</p><p>He wanted to murder Tom Marvolo Riddle.</p><p>He would resurrect himself as Lord Voldemort.</p><p>“Do you feel the darkness within you, Voldemort?” Zephyris’ gravelly voice rumbled.</p><p>“Yes.” Tom’s eyes were closed.</p><p>They stood in the entrance of the caves, beneath the opening in the ceiling which permitted the light of the moon to enter. The waterfall fell softly into the reflective pool at Tom’s feet. The stars gleamed in the mirror-like water.</p><p>“Feel the vapor of your magic around you. Only those who have explored the dark arts to the depths that we have can achieve feats of magic such as this. One must have enough <em>energy</em> to attract and channel more. Darkness attracts the dark. Feel your magic. Instruct it. You are its master. <em>Command</em> it, Voldemort. Do you feel it bending to your will?”</p><p>“Yes,” Tom replied. The wizard was so close, Tom could smell his rancid breath. It smelled like death and decay.</p><p>“Will it to call to the darkness in the air. Draw the energy of the universe to your fingertips. The darkness of the nighttime, of the dead lying in graveyards, of the ghosts in the depths of the seas, the shadows in the fiery pits of the earth… It is <em> everywhere</em>, waiting for you to grasp it, to <em> command </em> it. It will only bend its will to one who is strong enough to harness it. Call to it, boy.”</p><p>The half-giant’s voice grew deeper. “Speak the ancient language of the gods. The language of magic. <em> Clamabo ad tenebras.” </em></p><p>Tom repeated his chant.</p><p><em> “Cedo voluntati meae. Ego sum dominus tuus.</em>”</p><p>Tom spoke the words, and he began to feel a prickling along his skin. The hair on the back of his neck rose on end. He suddenly felt the same reverential weight that he’d experienced when he created his <em> tempaestus</em>. </p><p>Shadows danced along his skin. A feeling of deep dread began to engulf him, but he pressed back against it. He reached out with the tendrils of his magic to grab hold of the sinister presence. He spoke his own command. </p><p>
<em> “Servite mihi. Fac ut iubeo.” </em>
</p><p>Tom had dedicated years to studying linguistics as a student at Hogwarts. Many of the magical books he wished to read were written in Latin, French, and German. In order to read them properly, with all their subtleties and nuances, he decided he would have to learn these languages. He felt it was the only way to truly understand the magic within them. </p><p>“Good, Voldemort. <em> Very </em> good. I can sense the dark magic whispering. They are pleased to be at your command. Tomorrow, you will learn to harness this power in order to create a corporeal form. <em> Corpus ex tenebris. </em> A body of darkness."</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>“Thank you for inviting me, Supreme Mugwump.”</p><p>Hermione sat across from the Vicência Santos at a very upscale restaurant in the central wizarding district of Plovdiv. The older witch was tall and elegant, like a ballerina. She had dark hair and a deeply-etched wisdom in her features. It struck Hermione that she seemed to be the very image of the goddess Diana.</p><p>“Just call me Vicencia, Hermione.”</p><p>“I’m incredibly honored, Vicência.”</p><p>“I am a close friend of your father’s. Dumbledore is the greatest wizard of our time.”</p><p>Hermione nodded. “I have to agree, most whole-heartedly.” A floating bottle of wine poured both of their goblets full.</p><p>“Aside from that, he is your <em>father</em>. How wonderful it must be to have finally connected with him. It fills a certain void, wouldn’t you say?”</p><p>“Absolutely. I’ve never had a more motivated teacher.”</p><p>Vicência laughed. “He is, first and foremost, an educator. One could never take it out of him.”</p><p>Hermione laughed in response. “How fortunate I am to be able to learn from the greatest wizard alive.”</p><p>Vicência gazed at her searchingly, her eyes piercing. “Indeed. But you, Hermione. You are not simply Dumbledore’s daughter. You aspire to greatness, yourself… and I am pleased with the direction you are taking. You are a spokeswoman for the people… You are the voice of the future. You write with such elegance and passion. There are many already who follow you. They trust your guidance. That is a remarkable achievement at your young age. Have you any plans to pursue politics?”</p><p>Hermione’s eyes widened. “I- well, I hadn’t really thought about it. I suppose I’ve just been following my instincts, and my passions.”</p><p>Vicência smiled. “This is good. Your passion will lead you in the right direction. I should think if you desire to enter politics, you would be very successful. You could do a great deal of good. Of course, not everyone desires political power. Your father has evaded titles and positions at every turn. Despite this, his influence is irrefutable. Politics is not always the only way.”</p><p>Hermione nodded. “In my opinion, it is rare that someone’s desire for power and their desire to do good coincide.”</p><p>Vicencia’s eyebrows lifted sharply. “So you also see this? You are right. Most who desire power are only concerned with self, with control. Not with the well-being of the world at large. That is why the Qilin has always determined the leader of our world. To be the ruler of the magic world is a great weight and responsibility. Only those pure in heart can do so without destroying the entire world. I’m sure you know of my political opponent, Grindelwald.”</p><p>Hermione nodded. </p><p>Vicencia’s expression was grave. “Few are aware of this… but I am to step down from the position of Supreme Mugwump. Next year, or perhaps the year after. It is typically a lifetime commitment, but… the past ten years have taken their toll on me. Presiding over two wars is no easy feat. I desire to spend time with my family. I am a grandmother now.”</p><p>“I think that’s incredibly admirable,” Hermione murmured.</p><p>“Yes,” Vicencia smiled. “I will be watching your political career with great interest, Hermione. I fear the rise of someone like Grindelwald. His followers are in hiding, but they are still at large. There are still many in society who share his views and dreams. There were many who believed he had the right idea, but did not join his cause. They believed in his vision, but not in Grindelwald. I fear the rise of someone who could gain their trust and admiration. We must prevent this from ever happening. If it does, there could be a war like the world has never yet seen. Millions of muggles could die. The world could burn. We must proceed with caution and wisdom, always vigilant and ever watchful.” Vicência took Hermione’s hand. “I feel a kindred spirit in you. If you should need anything, Miss Dumbledore, please consider me a friend and an ally.”</p><p><em> If you only knew who I woke up in bed next to, you wouldn’t place so much faith in me, </em>Hermione thought wryly. </p><p>Then, she chided herself. Riddle had nothing to do with this. She <em> could </em> separate the two. She would have to.</p><p>“I don’t know what to say, Miss Santos. I’m incredibly honored. I only hope that I can live up to the potential you believe me capable of.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Tom apparated back to his flat on Sunday evening. He had to work early on Monday, and he’d slept very little in Albania. He was slightly off his schedule. He’d originally intended to arrive on Monday, but because of a certain <em> tempting </em> distraction, he hadn’t arrived until Wednesday. Therefore, he stayed up later than usual each night in an attempt to make up for lost time.</p><p>Now, he was purely knackered, and he’d already been exhausted <em> before </em> the trip.</p><p>The apparation drained him even further. Tom collapsed into bed, not even bothering to undress or even take off his shoes.</p><p>He took a deep breath, then gave in to the amorphous arms of sleep.</p><p>He had almost sunk out of consciousness when his eyes flew open.</p><p>His compulsion had flared. Where was Hermione? Had she arrived back in London yet?</p><p>He gritted his teeth in irritation. The compulsive need to know where she was grated at his nerves like an insistent itch.</p><p>He sat up. His jaw tensed. He hadn’t let himself think about her whilst he was in Albania. There, he was surrounded by people he didn’t trust. <em> Powerful </em> people. People he wanted to learn from, and then possibly kill, if he could. He was an incredibly skilled occlumens, but he didn’t know what unusual magical abilities Zephyris or Hausler might possess, so he kept his mind clear of Hermione. Even while he slept, he used dreamless sleep so he wouldn’t dream of her as he often did. Some dark wizards were known to prowl through the dreams of other witches and wizards while they slept. With the dark arts, there were no limitations. One couldn’t be sure what spells or enchantments might be like traps laid for the unsuspecting. He trusted the unbreakable vow that Dominik had taken, but Tom didn’t trust any dark wizards as a rule.</p><p>He only trusted himself.</p><p>He was powerful. Everyone, even his allies, would one day look for his weaknesses.</p><p>They would find none.</p><p>That was another reason that he kept himself under the radar. He needed time to learn the dark arts and to grow in his power unchecked, without worrying about enemies, without the Ministry monitoring him, and without being on the Confederation’s watchlist. The fewer people who knew about his goals and his <em> extracurricular activities </em>, the better.</p><p>Tom was smart. He was patient. He had a plan.</p><p>He was alone now, and he allowed himself to think of her. </p><p>He thought of her glowing skin… her soft moans. The pained cry she had released when he filled her.</p><p>He recalled how positively euphoric it had felt to be inside her. Tom’s adam’s apple bobbed as he swallowed.</p><p>She had fought him. She had <em> struck </em> him.</p><p><em> What a brave little witch, </em> he thought. </p><p>He found her fight tremendously arousing.</p><p>But then… she’d crumbled so exquisitely. It was an art, the way she’d submitted to him, with sweet moans and tears that drove Tom insane. </p><p>Tom realized that despite the way she yielded to his commands, he’d felt as though he were being shackled to her.</p><p>She was the one giving in, and yet…</p><p>He was becoming <em> addicted </em> to her.</p><p>This witch was much more dangerous than he’d originally imagined. She was a distraction, one that he would have to learn to compartmentalize if he wanted to achieve his goals and stay focused on his pre-determined path.</p><p>Tom knew that he should sleep, but first, he had to know where she was, or he wouldn’t be <em> able </em> to sleep.</p><p>Tom thought to himself that there really had to be a name for his strange compulsions.</p><p>He stood and began to cast the protective enchantments, drawing the runes on his floor with his wand. When the circle was set and glowed red, he laid on his bed and cast his soul from his body.</p><p>He’d just started to become proficient in using the <em> corpus ex tenebris </em>but he didn’t need to manifest it tonight. He was too magically drained to attempt it, and he didn’t want to become corporeal, because then Hermione would know he was there. He intended to check and see if she had made it back to London, and then journey back to his body and sleep.</p><p>Truthfully, he shouldn’t even be soul traveling after such a powerful apparation, but he supposed it would still be useful. Anytime he pressed the limits of his magic, it strengthened his magical stamina. He was steadily broadening the limits of what his magic could do. The more magically drained he became, the more he pushed himself. Just one more spell, one more curse. Don’t stop, Tom. If you stop, you die.</p><p>That was how he trained himself in dueling. When he started to feel his magical stores were being depleted, he pushed himself to do more. </p><p>He would test himself until he could defeat Dumbledore himself.</p><p>It didn’t take long at all for Tom to find his way to her penthouse. He was on Knockturn; she was on Horizont. They weren’t all that far from one another, which he supposed was convenient, considering he had <em> many </em> plans for Hermione Dumbledore.</p><p>He stood in front of the door to her flat, and he heard loud music coming from within. </p><p><em> Alright, </em> he thought. <em> Clearly, she’s home. </em></p><p>He knew he should go home and rest, but he was curious now. He stepped forward into her flat, his soul passing through the thick wooden door and materializing on the other side. The music was louder on this side, so he strode through the foyer until he came to the sitting room. His brow furrowed as he took in the sight.</p><p>The music was coming from some kind of strange muggle contraption. It reminded him vaguely of a phonograph… an enchanted box with a spinning black disc on the top. Some kind of odd black arm was dragging a pointed needle over the turning disc. </p><p>He’d never heard such music before. It didn’t sound like any muggle music he’d ever heard, but then, he hadn’t heard much of it since his childhood.</p><p>Hermione’s house elf was running here and there happily, dusting the various nooks and crannies of the flat. </p><p>Tom’s eyebrows rose when he caught sight of Hermione. </p><p>She wore practically nothing, a short, sleeveless little slip of a nightgown, cut from black satin with lace trim. It had a cheeky slit that gave him a daring view of her upper thigh. Tom cocked his head as he examined her. The fabric clung to her body, outlining her breasts and the slim curve of her hips. Over the nightgown (could it even be called that?), she wore a short satin robe with an oriental print of black, teal, and fuschia roses and paisleys, the belt of which was untied and hung loose. </p><p>In one hand, she was gripping an open bottle of wine by the neck and she was dancing all around her sitting room, her feet bare against her expensive Persian rug. </p><p> </p><p><em> Rhiannon rings like a bell through the night, and wouldn’t you love to love her? </em> </p><p>
<em> Takes to the sky like a bird in flight, and who will be her lover? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>With the music blaring through the flat, the elf in a joyous tizzy, and Hermione loping about, barefoot, in a very undignified and distinctly <em> pagan </em> fashion, the room was rather busy.</p><p>“Sing with me Piksy!”</p><p>“Piksy is not knowing the words, Miss Hermione…”</p><p>
<em> All your life you’ve never seen a woman, taken by the wind. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Would you stay if she promised you heaven? Will you ever win? </em>
</p><p>Tom crossed his arms and leaned against the open doorway, surprised by the strange sight before him. Hermione’s singing voice was rather terrible, another thing he filed away to embarrass her with later.</p><p>“Piksy is sooo happy Mistress Dumbledore is back home!” Her little house elf piped up cheerily.</p><p>“Yes, you’ve said so a <em> dozen </em> times already, Piksy!” </p><p>Hermione was inebriated. Completely sozzled on a light red elf-made wine. He could tell by the slight slur to her words.</p><p><em> She obviously didn’t lie about being a happy drunk, </em> Tom thought. <em> Perhaps it’s the one truth she’s told. </em></p><p>Tom watched as she leaped atop her maroon velvet sofa. “Sometimes you just have to let go and be <em> free </em>, Piksy!”</p><p>The house elf giggled and continued to dust and shine the surfaces.</p><p>Tom shook his head. This witch was absolutely out of her mind. Despite that fact, his eyes trailed down her sunkissed legs, and he decided that he’d never seen a finer pair. Her feet, in particular, he appraised, finding them dainty and delicate. He’d never thought of feet as <em> erotic </em> before he met Hermione, but there he was, staring at them with his tongue pressed against his cheek. His thoughts wandered, imagining her legs wrapped around his waist.</p><p>Hermione continued to twirl about in whirling dervishes, her head thrown back with her remarkably long hair looking wild, falling in tussled curls down her back. Her eyes were closed, lips parted. She paused only to toss the bottle of wine back. </p><p>Tom shook his head. <em> Never a boring moment with this witch, </em> he thought dryly.</p><p>The song she’d been spinning and cavorting to faded, transitioning into a lonely guitar ballad. Hermione fell back onto the sofa. She sat the bottle of wine on the floor beside her.</p><p>Tom crossed the room until he stood before her.</p><p>She looked right through him.<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em> I took my love, and I took it down… </em>
</p><p>
<em> Climbed a mountain then I turned around. </em>
</p><p>
<em> And I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills, </em>
</p><p>
<em> And the landslide brought it down… </em>
</p><p><br/>
Hermione’s eyes filled with tears suddenly, causing Tom to cock his head.</p><p><em> She certainly is an emotional drunk, </em> he thought.</p><p>“I did something terrible, Piksy,” Hermione sobbed.</p><p>“Now, now, Miss Hermione. You is doing <em> good </em> things. It is no need to fret!”</p><p>Hermione’s eyes were far away. “I miss Harry, and Ron. I miss my mom. I miss Luna and Ginny.”</p><p>Tom’s eyes narrowed, and he filed these names away for later. He noticed she had a book lying open on a little tufted ottoman. He turned his head to see and found that it was a book on tarot.</p><p>Tom could see her eyes were getting heavy.</p><p>The little house elf came toward her with a big knitted blanket.</p><p>“I did something terrible, Piksy,” Hermione murmured softly.</p><p>“Miss Hermione needs to sleep,” Piksy crooned. “Work for the paper is tomorrow. We is having have tea and scones in the morning, you said.”</p><p>“Bring me my elixir, Piksy.”</p><p>The little elf ran over to the cabinet and withdrew a vial of a pink liquid. Tom’s interest piqued, as he realized it was the same potion she had taken at Malfoy Manor after the duel.</p><p>Was she ill? Why did she take these so often?</p><p>Hermione drank it and within minutes, she was sleeping soundly, her lips parted, chest rising and falling softly.</p><p>The strange box with the spinning disc stopped playing, and it merely scraped and clicked repetitively.</p><p>Tom was confused by this strange scene he’d witnessed, but more determined than ever to discover more about Hermione. What was the little witch hiding? She would tell him eventually, he was sure of it.</p><p>He needed to be patient.</p><p>Tom let the silver cord guide him back to his body, and he immediately succumbed to much needed rest.</p><p><br/>

</div>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Hermione woke up on her couch feeling very hungover. She might have had a little episodic breakdown the previous night after portkeying back to London from Bulgaria. It had finally sunk in that she was likely trapped here in 1948 for good, and she reacted in the most healthy way imaginable. She got roaring drunk.</p><p>Additionally, she had given up trying to process <em> why </em> she was attracted to Tom Riddle. If she kept thinking about it, it would drive her crazy, because there was no rhyme or reason to it. It just made no sense. No matter how much she tried to remind herself of the hideous and terrifying Lord Voldemort from her own time, it did her no good. She couldn’t get Tom out of her head. Snippets from that night in Bulgaria kept replaying over and over in her mind. </p><p>The sound of his voice… the things he’d whispered in her ear as he drove into her. The way his skin felt against hers… his unique, masculine scent.</p><p>“Merlin, help me,” she groaned, fully exasperated with herself.</p><p>She didn’t want to be late for work. She was the reporter charged with writing about the ICW convention, and she had scrolls and scrolls of notes which she had to condense for her article. She threw on her robes, cast a charm on her hair, effectively taming it, and ran out the door. </p><p>She had woken rather late and so she hadn’t had her morning tea, which was a travesty, so she approached the little breakfast stand across the street from <em> The Daily Prophet </em> with intent. In front of the stand there were shelves of magazines and newspapers. She glanced at Witch Weekly and then bought a copy of <em> Rumours! </em>   She still kept up with what they were writing even though she’d effectively silenced their lies about herself. They had taken a massive hit in their readership, with subscribers cancelling left and right after Eulessia’s article about Hermione and Piksy hit the front page of <em> The Daily Prophet </em>. </p><p>The server handed Hermione a steaming tea latte of earl grey and vanilla. Hermione inhaled the scent of it with a smile, immediately feeling more awake and alive. She was still rather tired and hungover, but there was very little that a good cup of tea couldn’t remedy.</p><p>She pulled a few sickles out and went to pay, but the server said, “Oh, I’m sorry Miss, but the gentleman already paid for yours.”</p><p>Hermione’s brow furrowed, and she turned to where the woman was gesturing to find Tom Riddle standing there with an open copy of <em> The Prophet </em> in one hand and a cup of hot coffee in the other.</p><p>“I’ve said it before, but you’re not very aware of your surroundings,” he said, cutting his eyes at her.</p><p>Her cheeks grew hot. “What are you doing here?” she bristled. </p><p>He looked up from his paper and stared at her blankly. “I come to this stand every morning.”</p><p>“Oh,” she breathed, then nodded. “Right. I know.”</p><p>His eyebrows lifted. “You know?”</p><p>She froze. “I mean… I sometimes- I can see the stand from my, er… window. By my desk.”</p><p>He turned to look up at the upper floors of The Daily Prophet’s offices. Then he looked back to her. “I see.”</p><p>Hermione looked away awkwardly. “Well… thank you for the tea. Have a pleasant day.” She turned and began walking away swiftly.</p><p>Tom grabbed her arm and stopped her. “I know I said I would owl, but I got back rather late last night and fell into bed straightaway.” He held up his cup. “Thus, the coffee.”</p><p>She looked with wide eyes at the cup and then at Tom, then she shrugged. “There’s no explanation necessary.”</p><p>Tom pressed his tongue against his cheek. He stared at her, seeming somewhat confused by her demeanor. “Right.”</p><p>She swallowed, feeling strangely nervous and a bit at a loss for words. “I, um, had a bit of a late night last night as well, so… I’m not exactly at my most chipper this morning.”</p><p>The corners of his lips turned up, his expression amused by something. He made a show of looking her over. “You do look a bit peaky.”</p><p>Her hand flew to her face and she ran her hand across her eyes and down her cheek. “I do <em> not </em>!”</p><p>He ran his tongue over his teeth and grinned. “How was the remainder of your trip?” She didn’t miss the way his eyes flicked downward over her form as he said it.</p><p>“Oh,” she murmured awkardly. “It was… good. And yours?”</p><p>He inclined his head with a smirk, clearly finding her unease comical. “Productive.” </p><p>“That’s good, I suppose. Hopefully you didn’t murder any muggles, whilst in Albania,” she replied coolly.</p><p>He smiled, flashing his brilliant white teeth. “There was no murder… on <em> this </em> trip.” He winked at her.</p><p>She caught her breath, staring at him with wide eyes, prompting another chuckle from him. “I’ve got to open,” he muttered. “So I’d better get going.”</p><p>She nodded and quickly turned to leave. “Goodbye.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Hermione set her tea on her desk and sunk into her chair, feeling completely mortified. Why had she been so <em> bloody </em> awkward? And why was he so <em> smug </em>?</p><p>Everytime she saw him, she either wanted to slap him hard across the face or jump his bones. There was quite literally <em> no </em> in between. </p><p>“I hate him,” she breathed haughtily as she unfurled her scrolls of notes. In her discomfiture, she had forgotten to mention to him that he’d left his set of robes in her hotel room. Part of her wondered if he’d done it on purpose.</p><p><em> I suppose I’ll just have to owl him about it, </em> she thought. <em> It would be rude not to return them. </em></p><p>Hermione scrawled a little note across a spare bit of parchment and walked to the back of the newsroom where the <em> Prophet’s </em> owls were kept during the day. She sent a little barn owl off with her note through the second story window (he was a little grumpy and sleepy, but took the note all the same) and then she sat back at her desk, determined to focus on her article.</p><p> </p><hr/><p><br/>
Tom Riddle was in the middle of an argument with a customer who was actively attempting to convince him that he possessed a relic which at one time had belonged to the witch Morgan Le Fay. The man was asking a hefty sum for the item were he to sell it to Borgin. Tom was, in turn, informing the customer that as the authenticity of such an item could not be verified, it would need to be accompanied by a certificate of authentication by the British Historical Society of Magic before he would be released to purchase the item on behalf of his employer.</p><p>The wizard was getting more and more angry with Tom. </p><p>Tom was considering setting him aflame and watching him burn to ashes, and then perhaps transfiguring the “relic” into a dustpan with which he would sweep them up. </p><p>He regularly had these thoughts about difficult customers.</p><p>The customer grumbled and changed the topic. “What are your rates for goblin-wrought silver?”</p><p>“We are currently offering six galleons and three sickles to the ounce, sir,” Tom replied smoothly. </p><p>“That’s highway robbery, that is!” the man exclaimed. </p><p>Tom blinked slowly. “You’re more than welcome to take your silver elsewhere.”</p><p>As Tom debated whether he should <em> imperius </em> the man to shove his own wand up his nose, he heard a rapping on the window of the shop. </p><p>“Excuse me,” he muttered with a tight smile.</p><p>He crossed to the door and a little barn owl dropped a note in his hand. </p><p>He unfolded the parchment.</p><p>
<em> I forgot to inform you that you left your robes in my hotel room. </em>
</p><p>The note wasn’t signed, but he smirked. He knew precisely who sent it.</p><p>He was more than happy for the reprieve from his irritating customer, so he went to the front desk and scrawled a message of his own and sent it off with the owl. </p><p>
<em> How careless of me. I suppose I’ll just have to come get them. </em>
</p><p>A few minutes later, as he was finally seeing the customer out the door (quite lucky to leave with his life, honestly), the owl returned. Tom again opened the parchment.</p><p>
<em> No, no. That won’t be necessary. I’ll bring them to you tomorrow. </em>
</p><p>Tom wrote a note back and sent it off.</p><p>
<em> Suit yourself. By the way, I never thanked you for the scones. </em>
</p><p>Tom returned to stocking in a few new acquisitions. About ten minutes later, the owl returned. He unrolled the tiny bit of parchment. </p><p>
<em> What scones? </em>
</p><p>Tom smirked. He gripped his quill and wrote back: <em> Is everything that comes out of your mouth a lie, little witch? </em></p><p>He sent the bird off with the note, and got back to work.</p><p>About thirty minutes later, the owl returned. Tom read her response. </p><p>
<em> Technically these are words on paper. </em>
</p><p>Tom scrawled his reply onto a ripped off bit of parchment:</p><p><em> You know what scones I’m referring to </em>.</p><p><em> Cheeky little cunt </em>, he thought to himself as he sent the owl away.</p><p>As he sorted through a set of old magical portraits and a trunk filled with enchanted artwork, he couldn’t help thinking about how Hermione had looked in that little black slip she’d been wearing the previous night.</p><p>After a few minutes, the owl returned with her note. </p><p><em> I do not. But, apparently, they were quite memorable </em>.</p><p>Tom shook his head and sighed, then wrote his response. </p><p> </p><hr/><p><br/>
Hermione smiled to herself when she opened Tom’s note.</p><p>
<em> Incredibly memorable. Did you make them yourself? </em>
</p><p>Hermione’s co-worker, a grumpy goblin named Kogrod, gave her an exasperated look when she sent the little owl off, yet again. Her note read:</p><p>
<em> I still don’t know what scones you’re referring to, but as to your inquiry, I am quite skilled at baking. </em>
</p><p>Hermione promptly went back to condensing her notes on the <em> Fiendfyre </em> debacle and its subsequent hearing which would take place in January. </p><p>The owl rapped at the window in front of her desk. Hermione took the paper and opened it. </p><p>
<em> Bake me something else. </em>
</p><p>Hermione bit her lip, but rolled her eyes all the same. She gripped her quill and wrote, <em> You’re quite bossy, aren’t you? </em></p><p>She sent the poor owl off again<em> .  </em></p><p>A good forty minutes went by before she received his response. She assumed he must have been busy with a customer, which launched her into vivid daydreams of what precisely he might have been assisting a customer <em> with </em>. Hermione giggled to herself, imagining “the Dark Lord” himself working retail. She hoped he wore a silly apron and had to assist grumpy old biddies. </p><p><em> He’d probably just charm them all </em>, she thought in annoyance as she unfurled his note and read it.</p><p><em> Please </em> <em> bake me something else, my dearest lying witch. </em></p><p>Despite herself, Hermione clapped a hand over her mouth to keep from laughing aloud. </p><p>It was all she could do to bring herself to scribble something back. </p><p>
<em> Much better, thank you. </em>
</p><p>She tied the note to the owl’s leg and sent him off, ignoring a menacing look from Kogrod.</p><p>She vowed to bring the owl a big bag of treats the next day.</p><p>Eustace Brown, one of the copy editors (who happened to be an ancestor of Lavender’s) was at her desk discussing some edits when the owl returned.</p><p>She unfurled the note as he droned on about revisions or punctuation or something of the sort. Hermione never really listened to him, truth be told. </p><p>Her cheeks instantly reddened as she read the note.</p><p>
<em> I’d generally prefer it if you were the one doing the begging. You do it so prettily. </em>
</p><p><em> Holy cricket </em> , she thought. <em>He</em> <em>  is flirting with me </em>.</p><p>She cleared her throat, but Eustace was still prattling away and hadn’t seemed to notice anything was amiss.</p><p>She penned a reply and sent the owl off again.</p><p> </p><hr/><p><br/>
Tom smirked as he read her response. She’d pointedly ignored his innuendo, which probably meant that she was blushing profusely.</p><p>
<em> While you’re thanking me for things, you might as well thank me properly for all those commissions you’ve been raking in from “cursed” goblin-wrought silver. </em>
</p><p>“Cheeky witch,” he whispered.</p><p>He scrawled a response and sent it off. </p><p>
<em> I am certainly in your debt. I suppose you should allow me to take you to dinner, then?  </em>
</p><p>About an hour later, he was ringing up a woman he’d convinced to purchase a set of enchanted gloves when Hermione’s response came. </p><p>
<em> I’ll think about it. Now we should probably stop passing notes like besotted schoolchildren. My coworkers are starting to look at me funny and the owl is completely buggered. I now owe him a week’s worth of treats. </em>
</p><p>Tom chuckled to himself and tucked her note into his pocket.</p><p> </p><p><br/>

<p> </p><p>“My Lord,” Abraxas greeted with a low bow as Riddle walked through the front doors of Malfoy Manor. “Welcome back to London, my friend.”</p><p>“Yes, Malfoy, thank you. Where is the book?” Tom threw his cloak over his arm as he made his way to the library, forcing Abraxas to keep up.</p><p>“Book?”</p><p>“The book on Soul Bonds, which else?”</p><p>“Ah, yes, my apologies. I did have Dobby fetch it for you. Dobby!”</p><p>The elf promptly appeared with a crack.</p><p>“Did you locate the book I asked you to find for Mr. Riddle?”</p><p>“Yes, sir, Dobby did find it straightaway.”</p><p>Abraxas nodded. “Very good. See that you bring it to the library for Mr. Riddle, and quickly, no dawdling.”</p><p>“Yes, sir.” The elf immediately apparated away.</p><p>“How was your trip, my Lord?” Abraxas followed Tom into the library.</p><p>“Busy.”</p><p>Abraxas noted that Tom seemed quite preoccupied. “That’s good. Busy is good, sir.”</p><p>Tom cocked a brow and gave Malfoy a look as if to say, “Why are you still here?”</p><p>Abraxas nodded and began to back toward the door. “Ah, yes, well… I will see you Saturday morning, for our meeting, as usual. I’ll leave you to your studies, then.” Abraxas left, chagrined.</p><p>A moment later, Dobby apparated into the library, bearing an old book with faded red fabric and fraying ends. “Here is the book Master Riddle was requesting. Will you be needing anything else from Dobby, sir?”</p><p>Tom shook his head absentmindedly. “No, that’s all. Thank you.”</p><p>He took the book from the elf’s hand and then waited as he apparated away. He scanned the front of the book, entitled, <em> A Marriage of Spirits: The Anatomy of the Magical Core and the Fundamentals of Stitching Souls. </em></p><p><em> Interesting, </em> Tom thought. </p><p>It was Thursday. He’d been too busy catching up at work to continue his research. For the past few days since they’d both returned to London, he and Hermione had written back and forth during work hours. The day after their conversation using a rather grumpy owl, Tom had sent her an enchanted parchment, which utilized a spell similar to the spell he’d cast on his journal horcrux, which allowed them to write back and forth magically, barring the use of owls.</p><p>Despite her strange hesitancy to talk to him, he had come to enjoy her cheeky repartee and snarky little quips. It broke up the monotony of the day, so to speak. Her birthday was this Sunday, and he had plans for her, whether she realized it or not.</p><p>But now, he honed in his focus because he intended to research more deeply the subject of soul matter and the connection between soulmates, which could potentially heighten his magical power significantly, according to myth. </p><p>Tom sat in a tufted leather chair by the hearth, which now housed a crackling fire, as the mornings had begun to grow rather cool. He scanned the various chapters of the book until he found a passage that piqued his interest.</p><p>
<em> Twin flames, or mirror souls, are the epitome of true soulmates. These individuals may have different bodies, but are two halves of one soul. In essence, they are one soul split between two bodies. Their magical cores are tethered throughout eternity, and many may find that when they meet, they suddenly possess memories from lifetimes they had not previously remembered. Many witches and wizards report having dreams about their twin flames prior to meeting them. Their souls cast projections throughout time and space which manifest in a seer-like gift or a psychic link. Often these individuals refer to feeling as though they’d been connected by some higher power. It can feel rather divine, as the god-magic within is calling to its magical mate. Some report feeling the connection as a physical manifestation, or a powerful bodily magnetism. Twin flames are connected mind, body, soul, and magical core. This connection typically manifests in an instant spark or magnetic pull. Because of the nature of this soul connection, the twin flame will mirror back one’s own deepest insecurities, fears, and shadows. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Twin flames complete and complement one another, but often cause insecurities and doubts about oneself to amplify, because their union is designed to purge negative energy and patterns. These relationships are quite often marked by challenges and tumultuous emotions, the intensity and passion of which cannot be matched. A twin flame connection can often feel “on again off again,” or “push and pull,” with one or the other party leaving and reuniting at intervals throughout the course of the relationship. A twin flame relationship is, at its core, a journey of rebirth. </em>
</p><p>
<em> When twin flames run from one another, they are never running from their match; they are running from themselves.  </em>
</p><p>Tom read the rest of the chapter, noting the eight stages of twin flame relationships. Then he came upon a fascinating paragraph along with a diagram of the anatomy of a wizard’s magical core.</p><p>
<em> A witch or wizard’s magical core is bound to the soul, which has seven regions, or lamps. When two souls possess a twin flame connection, they are energetically connected through all seven centers, with the strongest cord of connection being at the heart. Because a heart-connection is the strongest of all between twins, any emotion experienced by one is transmitted to the other via the silver cord of the soul, or the vitanervis. </em>
</p><p>
<em> The telepathic connection between twin flames is hindered by the eternal severance of their magical cores. When something is transferred through magical energy, it is picked up by the subconscious mind or the aureatic center of the witch or wizard, and then interpreted through the five senses, or the conscious mind. This means that the witch or wizard might receive telepathic messages from their twin flame, which is transmitted through sensory knowledge, resulting in intuitive knowing, a flash of mental images or thoughts, hearing their voice in the mind, even telepathic dreams, etc.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> The twin flame, legend has it, is said to appear when one’s ego is trapped in a karmic cycle of toxicity. The soulmate is a perfect mirrored frequency and tends to trigger a natural process of “cleaning” out the soul of emotional trauma and mental processes which prevent a witch or wizard from living their highest and most authentic self. The gods divinely orchestrate these reunions in order to keep balance within the universe and bring wizardkind and mankind alike into harmony. </em>
</p><p>“Load of bollocks,” Tom muttered. </p><p>He flipped the pages, searching for any knowledge he might find of the spell to create a soul bond.</p><p>Finally, he found the incantation he was searching for.</p><p>According to the book, soul bonding was a spell that could be used to stitch severed souls back together. It would only work with a twin flame connection, which could be adequately tested using a potion called the <em>Tears of Adonis</em>. Once the validity of the connection was established, the pair must locate an object called the <em>Ribbon of Life,</em> which would then be used in a ceremony along with the incantation, <em> Amare Vinculum </em>. There was a diagram in the book which dictated the precise usage of the Ribbon as well as the correct wand movements.</p><p>Once the twin flames had merged into one soul inferno, their magical cores would be shared and their power would be increased to levels which heretofore had never yet been studied or processed. Additionally, their souls would become one, essentially meaning that they would be able to read one another’s thoughts without hindrance or blockage, their memories would be shared between their minds, and each would feel the emotions of the other. Unimpeded unity.</p><p>Tom wasn’t sure how he felt about that. The uncharted magical power sounded tempting, but the sharing of thoughts and feelings made him rather wary. Of course, if Hermione was truly his twin flame, if such a thing <em> did </em> exist, then would it really matter? Wouldn’t she be his perfect match in every way? </p><p>The book went on to explain that there had been very few cases of true twin flames which had successfully been merged. This was somewhat disheartening to Tom, but he decided he’d better try anyway. But first, he had to discover if such a thing even existed, and if it did, was Hermione his soulmate? </p><p>He began to search the shelves of the library, collecting a stack of potions books. He combed the best books in the library, but to his dismay, not a single one mentioned a potion by the name of <em> Tears of Adonis </em>. </p><p>At this point, he’d already sunk three hours into this study and was rather frustrated to come to a sudden halt. </p><p>He decided that his best bet was to reach out to his old Potions instructor, Professor Slughorn. If anyone would have knowledge of the rare and archaic brew, it would be him.</p><p>He promptly left the library, leaving behind a note to Abraxas, letting him know he was borrowing the book which he intended to perform a duplicating spell upon. He apparated away from Malfoy Manor and went straight to the owlery to write his old professor.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Hermione walked the little stone path to the Weasley’s cottage and passed through a little wooden picket fence. Gnomes circled her feet as she walked, as well as a plethora of other magical garden creatures. </p><p>“Well, hello there,” Hermione chuckled. “You’re not afraid at all of strangers, are you all?”</p><p>The front garden was filled with potions ingredients, Aconite and Asphodel, a large variety of toadstools, Boomberry and Bursting Mushrooms, Daisyroot and Fluxweed, Thyme, Vervain, Valerian, Nettle and Nightshade, and a wide range of different herbs and flowers, the most beautiful of which were the multicolored roses. Hermione had never seen such a well-tended garden, save perhaps the garden at Malfoy Manor. However, Hermione preferred the former, as it had a distinctly cozy and homey feeling. </p><p>She knocked on the wooden door, which had a little moon-shaped window. After a few moments and the sound of a baby’s laughter, Septimus Weasley arrived at the door.</p><p>“Welcome, welcome, friend! Please enter our humble abode!”</p><p>Hermione crossed into a lovely little den that reminded her so distinctly in nature of the Burrow that she felt her chest tighten. It was nearly as eclectic as the Burrow, but with plants in every corner of the little house. There was a roaring fire in the hearth and Hermione smelled something mouth-watering wafting through the air. </p><p>The wooden floors of the cottage transitioned to stone as they made their way to the kitchen and dining area. The cottage had diamond-paned, stained glass windows with green cabinets and butcherblock countertops. Herbs and plants hung in front of every window. The house bore a clean scent of thyme and lemon. </p><p>A pretty brown-haired witch walked out of the kitchen, fanning herself. She had a little baby on her hip who possessed a shock of red hair, in typical Weasley fashion, and she grinned from ear to ear at Hermione. </p><p>“It is just such an honor to meet you, Miss Dumbledore, may I please call you Hermione? I feel as if I know you already, the way Septimus has jabbered on about you since the convention.”</p><p>Hermione smiled broadly and took the woman’s offered hand with both of her own. “I would much prefer it if you would call me Hermione. Thank you for inviting me to your home.”</p><p>The witch looked around her. “Well, it isn’t much but we love it. Thank you for coming here; it’s so hard to get out with little Bilius right now. He’s teething and he’s an absolute <em> horror </em> if he can’t get his sleep.” She jerked her head toward Septimus and lowered her voice. “This one wants another one soon. The audacity! I told him he’s more than welcome if he can birth one himself.”</p><p>Hermione giggled and then grinned, and held out her hands to the little boy, who instantly reached his arms out for Hermione to take him. Cedrella’s brow furrowed and her mouth dropped open. “He’d <em> never </em> wanted to be held by anyone before, much less a stranger! He’s so <em> shy </em> , you see… That is just absolutely <em> bizarre </em>!”</p><p>Septimus walked by with a handful of grapes as he popped one in his mouth and grinned. “I think that’s a sign, dear. Hermione’s goin’ to be one of the family!”</p><p>Hermione’s heart felt full to bursting already by the warmth of the domestic scene and their hearty welcome of her. It felt like a blast from home, and she hadn’t realized how much she missed the Weasleys until she stood in Septimus and Cedrella’s home. Hermione fought back tears.</p><p>“Oh my, are you quite alright, Hermione?” Cedrella fussed. “Did I say something wrong?”</p><p>“No, no,” Hermione reassured her, wiping at her tears, embarrassed. “Of course not. I just… I haven’t made many friends, since I’ve come to London, and, with my mother gone…”</p><p>“Oh, well, of course. How silly of me. I suppose as much as your name is in the papers, I assumed you’d be swimming in people around you!”</p><p>Hermione smiled wryly, wrinkling her nose. “Well, I suppose I am, but… I don’t feel much kinship with any of them.”</p><p>“Of course not!” Septimus piped in. “These London crowds are all the same. It’s all about who’s who in the magical zoo. Blood status and gold and lineage. But <em> we </em> have a true passion for the greater good, and that’s what makes us special. Sets us apart, as it were.”</p><p>“Hermione, are you hungry? I’ve a Lancashire hotpot that I’m just about to pull out of the oven.”</p><p>Septimus leaned over to Hermione and winked. “Her hotpot is the best in Britain, guaranteed. There’s no one, witch or muggle alike, who can make it better!”</p><p>Hermione nodded. “It smells absolutely divine. I’d love to stay for dinner.”</p><p>“Perfect!” Cedrella beamed gleefully. “Goodness, I don’t believe we’ve had anyone over for dinner since Bilius was born!”</p><p>“Speaking of which,” Hermione interjected. “I know it’s a bit short notice, but my birthday is this Sunday, and Dumbledore is planning a little garden party at his home in Godric’s Hollow. Don’t feel pressured to come, but I would be remiss not to extend an invitation, all the same.”</p><p>“Oh, we wouldn’t miss it,” muttered Septimus. “I’d love to see old Dumbledore again. He was my favorite professor, hands down. Brilliant chap, great fellow. Course I’m a bit biased myself, being a Gryffindor.”</p><p>“Well, I was a Slytherin, as all the Blacks were and continue to be,” Cedrella said conspiratorially. “But I might as well have been a Gryffindor, as much time as I spent with this one in the Gryffindor common room.” She gestured to Septimus and grinned.</p><p>Hermione laughed. She wished she could reminisce with them about her favorite school. “Must have been wonderful to attend Hogwarts.”</p><p>“Oh, certainly, never a better school to exist!” Septimus declared. </p><p>Hermione bounced little Bilius on her hip as Cedrella brought out a steaming pot of lamb and vegetables braised in a mint sauce and covered with crispy scalloped potatoes and thyme. </p><p>The four ate together at a long wooden farm table and afterward had a spot of tea with sticky toffee pudding until they were all sufficiently stuffed. The conversation varied among topics such as Ministry politics, muggles and their witty inventions, a muggle museum for the wizarding world, the Blacks and their prejudice (a rather sorrowful topic for Cedrella), and how Hermione and Septimus might join forces.</p><p>Hermione’s heart was full as she made her way back down the little stone path and through the garden gate. When she apparated back to her flat in the nippy dusk of twilight, she felt a bit more hopeful than she had the last few weeks.</p><p>She lay on her bed that night, engulfed in peony pink silken sheets and a mountain of pillows. She threw back a vial of elixir, which she hadn’t felt that she needed, but her body was beginning to become dependent upon it. </p><p>“I can stop any time,” she whispered. “I don’t need it. I’ll stop soon.”</p><p>As the waves of euphoria and contentment washed over her, she wished she could feel Tom’s skin on hers, and she wondered what his flat was like. She imagined his flat bare and skeletal. A bed with clinical white sheets and one or two pillows. A simple coverlet. Nothing extraordinary. Yes, she could see him surrounded by ordinary and lackluster furnishings. He was so extraordinary himself, it seemed only fitting. Did he wear pajamas? She imagined he slept naked. She wondered if he were a morning person.</p><p>She didn’t let herself think about Voldemort or horcruxes.</p><p>She only thought about his hands, with their long fingers and protruding veins.</p><p>Her eyes finally grew heavy, and she fell into a deep slumber.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Tom Riddle sat in the sunroom of Wilhelmina Tuft’s stately Elizabethan home. The estate stretched for miles, even rivaling Malfoy Manor’s beauty.</p><p>He’d had a long Saturday. His morning had consisted of his bi-monthly meeting at The Leaky Cauldron with his Death Eaters, where Dolohov had royally pissed him off. Then he’d spent the rest of the day running the shop by himself, as Mr. Burke was at an estate sale picking up new magical artifacts and Mr. Borgin had oddly contracted Dragon Pox and was indisposed. Tom had spent most of the day thinking of ways to punish Dolohov for his insolence.</p><p>Mrs. Tuft’s house elf delivered a tray of tea and tea cakes. </p><p>“I admit I was surprised you asked for this meeting, Mr. Riddle. You were rather short with me in your letters. I was beginning to think I’d said something to offend you.”</p><p>“I’m not much for writing letters. Never have been. I don’t care for paper trails either. I prefer to chat about such topics in person.”</p><p>Her delicate eyebrows lifted sharply. “Should I be insulted? I confess I’d hoped you trusted me more.”</p><p>Tom stared at her blankly as he took a sip of the tea she poured him. “First of all, I’ve already told you I don’t trust anyone, so that shouldn’t surprise you. Second of all, paper trails… they rarely end up in the hands of those they’re meant for.”</p><p>“You are very careful,” she said as she sipped her tea. </p><p>He inclined his head but said nothing.</p><p>“Hmm,” she sighed. “Well, I can’t pretend I’m not happy you asked for this meeting.”</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>“It is,” she said with a smile. “I’ve always enjoyed your company greatly, Mr. Riddle.”</p><p>He stared at her. Then, he took out his cigarettes. “You didn’t mind last time so I assume that hasn’t changed.”</p><p>“Your muggle cigarettes do not offend me in the slightest.”</p><p>“Lucky me.”</p><p>She chuckled. “Your humor is quite dry. Is that a show?”</p><p>“I don’t pretend to have a sense of humor, Mrs. Tuft.”</p><p>She flicked her eyes at him. “You try to seem so serious.”</p><p>“And <em>you</em> try to veer the conversation away from business. I wonder why?”</p><p>She shrugged. “Perhaps I like to get a feel for the people I do business with.”</p><p>“A feel,” Riddle muttered. “You’re trying to get a feel for me?”</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>Tom lit his cigarette with a match, then shook the flame out. “Only last time we met you were telling me you supported Grindelwald’s ideals. I would hope you had a feel for me by then.”</p><p>She clicked her nails on the table. Tom wondered if it was a nervous tick or an irritated gesture. “What people tell me about a person, and what I discern for myself, are very different things.”</p><p>Tom inhaled the smoke into his lungs and sat back in his chair. “Do you think you’re a good judge of character?”</p><p>“Character is subjective, Mr. Riddle.”</p><p>“Character,” he mused. “Is to stay staunchly true to one’s ideals. To never waver or back down from what one believes. But determining what a person believes… that is the difficult part. Most people lie about their ideals.”</p><p>“Do you lie about yours?”</p><p>Smoke poured from his lips. “Oh, absolutely.”</p><p>“Hmm.” She smiled. “I find you very interesting.”</p><p>He cocked his head and took another drag from his cigarette. “I think you find me irritating.”</p><p>“Oh, most definitely. But all the most irritating people do happen to be wildly interesting, wouldn’t you agree?”</p><p>He thought about a certain witch. “Perhaps.”</p><p>“Let me ask you something, Tom. May I call you Tom?”</p><p>“I told you last time we met that you may.”</p><p>“Oh, that’s right.” She smiled prettily. He decided that he disliked her coy manner. She crossed and then uncrossed her legs in a way that drew his eye, and he knew precisely what she was doing.</p><p>Tom disliked very much when women attempted to manipulate him.</p><p>Manipulation, in Tom’s mind, was an “eat or be eaten” game. If a person was weak-minded enough to allow themselves to be manipulated, then it was fair play. But if one tried to manipulate a person who was well aware of such tactics, such as Tom was, then it was also fair play for Tom to want to kill that person.</p><p>He wanted to kill Wilhelmina Tuft. It was an irrational desire that carried a sense of foreboding as if it were nearly inevitable that he would murder the woman in front of him. Tom didn’t understand this. </p><p>He wouldn’t kill her, because for the time being he needed her. So instead, he baited her, befriended her, and charmed her.</p><p>She thought she could attract him the way she’d attracted her wealthy husband. A husband who’d paid for her entire campaign and her expensive clothing.</p><p>She was an intelligent woman, but she had two major flaws, Tom decided. One was that she always wanted what she couldn’t have. The second was that she thought the only way to gain power was by seducing the right men.</p><p>“What would you like to ask me, Mrs. Tuft?”</p><p>Her blue eyes met his. “If the statute were to fall, what kind of world do you envision? There are many who support the dismantling of the Statute… but there are few who know what that would entail. The few who do, all have differing opinions of what a Post-Statute world would look like.”</p><p>Tom inhaled smoke from his cigarette, watching the cherry blaze red as he looked at her. “Do you have an opinion, Mrs. Tuft?”</p><p>She smiled secretively. “I have a dream. That is all.”</p><p>His jaw tensed and he scoffed. “All you politicians ever have is dreams. But someone else has got to do your dirty work for you in order to make it all happen. I don’t have dreams. I deal in realities. I’m a realist. Never been an idealist. I think some people have grand ideas of what it would look like should the statute fall. All sunshine and roses. They either think wizardkind is going be the ruler of the free world with the muggles in some sort of elf-like servitude. Or on the other side of things, some think that the muggles will happily embrace the world of wizards and muggles and wizards will work together toward a greater tomorrow, put their keen minds together and forge a new path the world has never seen before.  I don’t think any of that will happen.”</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. “What do you think will happen, then?”</p><p>His black eyes pierced hers. He lifted the cigarette to his mouth and inhaled, then breathed out smoke as he replied, “War. Bloodshed. Unspeakable evils done on both sides.”</p><p>Her brow drew forward sharply. “Why do you draw that conclusion?”</p><p>He shrugged. “Some wizards admire muggles. Other wizards despise them. I don’t do either. I watch them. I observe them passively. They aren’t so different from wizardkind, truth be told. But in the absence of magic, they are on a road to destruction. Wizards who believe that muggles would embrace our kind are delusional. Muggles will never accept wizards, because our magic is too powerful. Magic is might. The muggles will be intimidated by that. They will be jealous. They will be fearful. They already divide amongst themselves. They find things to fear among their own kind, so much so that they fight bloody wars over of these imagined differences. The witch trials of Salem are but a taste of the hell that the muggles could unleash. Their numbers are in the billions. When muggles inevitably try to harness the power of magic, and are unsuccessful, they will then turn on wizards. Then wizards will be forced to unleash powerful magic upon them. There will be great death on both sides. That is what I foresee.”</p><p>She swallowed as she ran her dainty fingers around the rim of her empty teacup. “And yet… you still support the dissolving of the statute? Why?”</p><p>“The statute cannot hold forever. There are already so many breaches that the Confederation can hardly keep up. I say we get ahead of it and strike preemptively.”</p><p>Her interest piqued, and her guise dropped for a moment. “And you have a dream for how this should be implemented, then?”</p><p>He cocked his jaw to the side and smirked. “I don’t have dreams, Mrs. Tuft. Only plans.”</p><p><br/>

<em> Dear Mr. Riddle, </em>
</p><p>
<em> I would be more than happy to assist you in your quest for the Tears of Adonis potion. I believe I still have the recipe somewhere. It is a rather antiquated brew. Only us older potioneers still know it, I imagine. The only book I recall containing it is currently out of print due to its instruction on a dangerous transfiguration potion which is now banned in 56 countries. I will owl if I find it. Is there a reason you’re asking after it? Have you perhaps met a lucky witch? </em>
</p><p>
<em> Do stop by and see me sometime, my boy. I do so miss your presence at my gatherings.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Are you still working at that antique shop? I’m sure my connections at the ministry would be more than happy to take you on, should you desire. You have only to owl. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Warm regards, </em>

Hermione woke up on Sunday morning to a little light show of fireworks outside her window, courtesy of Dumbledore. </p><p>She smiled as she jumped out of bed.</p><p>She was twenty years old today. </p><p>She shook her head as she made her way to the kitchen to brew her morning tea. What a vast difference one year had made in Hermione’s life.</p><p>Last year around this time, she had just found herself thrown back in time. Had it really been a year already? The leap had added a few months, but for all intents and purposes, it had been nearly a year.</p><p>Her last day in 1998 had been August 28th. She had just gotten back from an early birthday party at the Burrow. </p><p>She had been listless and directionless. Sad and depressed. Confused about Ron. Guilty about the many deaths that had occurred. She’d felt guilty to be alive. That she’d survived. </p><p>She had been preparing for her final year at Hogwarts, excited to take her NEWTS finally. She recalled being unsure about what she wanted to do with her life. Work for the ministry? Become an activist? An auror? </p><p>All that worry, for nothing, she thought wryly.</p><p>In the course of one year, she’d traveled back in time, and now she was the highest paid journalist at The Daily Prophet, a delegate of the ICW, an aspiring political figure, co-founder of a new wizarding bank (which she felt rather accomplished about, seeing as that was something which would permanently affect the future) and a muggle activist. </p><p>Not to mention, she was now the adopted daughter of the greatest wizard alive and was learning directly under his tutelage.</p><p>Not to mention, she may or may not have had sex with her worst enemy.</p><p>Well. Scratch that. She definitely had.</p><p>Yes, a lot had changed in the past year.</p><p>So much so that Hermione was still reeling from all of the changes. </p><p>Hermione had decided to take it easy this birthday. In the late afternoon, she would have a few of her new friends over for a garden party to celebrate. Until then, she would simply relax and breathe the fresh air in her garden.</p><p>That is, it had been her plan until the packages started arriving. Boxes and boxes from various shops and vendors bearing gifts for Hermione Dumbledore.</p><p>She had Piksy stack them all in a corner. She’d get to them eventually. Hermione wanted nothing more than to enjoy the peace and quiet of her day and reminisce about her old life. She would allow herself to think about it, today.</p><p>She wished there was a way to get a letter home to her friends and loved ones, if only to let them know she was alive and well. </p><p>The best thing I could do for them, she thought sadly, is kill Tom Riddle.</p><p>She reached in her work bag and withdrew the rolled up parchment which he’d enchanted as a form of communication. It was an impressive piece of magic, and it reminded her of the journal he’d made into a horcrux. Perhaps it was even a similar spell he’d used for both. She fingered it mindlessly, then unfurled it, wondering if his last note would still be visible. </p><p>To her surprise, a  new message was written on it.</p><p><em> Happy birthday, little witch </em>.</p><p>Hermione rubbed her lips together to keep from smiling. How had he known it was her birthday? Only the ministry had her records, and a few shops which she suspected was Dumbledore’s doing. </p><p>She should probably have expected Tom would have connections in the ministry, especially with his roster of powerful and influential friends. </p><p>She pulled out her quill and ink, and penned a response. His message disappeared as she began writing. </p><p><em> How did you know it’s my birthday </em>?</p><p>About fifteen minutes later, his response manifested on the parchment. </p><p><em> A secret for a secret, darling </em>.</p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes. He really was an irritating sod.</p><p>Part of her still suspected him of some kind of espionage. She wondered if this was all some grand scheme to discover her true identity, or to use her for his own political gain.</p><p>It would be rather hard to fake their connection, but if anyone could do so, it was the charming, manipulative, and cold-blooded Tom Riddle.</p><p>With that in mind, Hermione carefully approached her interactions with Tom.</p><p><em> I find it hilarious that you seem to think I harbor a closet full of classified mysteries which you’ve made it your mission to uncover. Must be tiring work, trying to unearth all these hidden enigmas </em>.</p><p>His reply came swiftly.</p><p>
<em> The more you deny it, little witch, the more reassured I am that I’m correct in my assumptions.</em>
</p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes and scrawled a quick response.</p><p>
<em> Do you always interrogate your romantic interests on their birthdays?</em>
</p><p>Several minutes passed, and Hermione tapped her foot anxiously as she waited, casting intermittent glances at the parchment.</p><p>She was starting to second-guess her referral to herself as a romantic interest, when his reply began to appear.</p><p>
<em>I couldn’t say for certain, Hermione. You’re the only romantic interest I’ve ever had.</em>
</p><p>Hermione’s cheeks flushed bright red. Her heart beat dangerously and she swallowed thickly. How was he able to evoke such intense reactions from her with but a few simple words? It was uncanny and frightening.</p><p>Suddenly another message appeared on the parchment.</p><p><em> Tell me, little witch… are you blushing </em>? </p><p>“What!” Hermione exclaimed and she dropped her quill. </p><p>How was he able to read her so well, even when he wasn’t physically present?</p><p>“I hate him,” she breathed, but she picked up her quill nonetheless and scrawled her response.</p><p><em> No. I’m busy accepting birthday gifts </em>.</p><p>His reply came a moment later. </p><p>
<em> Ever the popular socialite. What are your plans for today?</em>
</p><p>She quilled an answer.</p><p><em> My father is hosting a little get-together in Godric’s Hollow</em>. </p><p>Hermione paused, wondering if she should invite him, but decided against it. It would make for a rather awkward gathering should <em> Heir of Slytherin </em> Tom Riddle show up out of the blue amongst a gathering of Gryffindors. Especially when most people assumed she was still romantically involved with Alphard Black. Hermione didn’t need any unnecessary questions being asked. She wasn’t even completely sure what it was that was <em> happening </em> between the two of them, anyway. She hoped he wouldn’t think it rude that she didn’t invite him. He’d even said that he didn’t care what she did in public. He seemed more concerned with her private loyalties than her public ones.</p><p>His response slowly materialized on the parchment.</p><p>
<em> Come to my flat after.</em>
</p><p>Her heart beat swiftly. </p><p><em> Why? </em> she wrote.</p><p>His reply came a moment later. </p><p><em> Because I said so</em>.</p><p>Hermione pursed her lips and lifted her chin. Arrogant sod, she thought. She scrawled her message furiously on the parchment.</p><p>
<em> That is not, nor will it ever be, a good reason. Try again.</em>
</p><p>She could just picture him getting irritated. His jaw always ticked whenever she got under his skin.</p><p>His response began to manifest on the paper.</p><p>
<em> Will you deny me the opportunity to give you a birthday present in person?</em>
</p><p>“Oh,” she whispered. Her heart fluttered. She could hardly deny that she’d wondered about where he lived, and against her better judgment… she did <em> want </em> to see him.</p><p>After a few minutes of apprehensive deliberation, she scribbled a reply. </p><p>
<em> Send me the address. </em>
</p><p>She bit the end of her quill nervously until his answer appeared.</p><p>
<em> 524 Knockturn Alley, Apartment F </em>
</p><p>
<em>See you tonight, little witch.</em>

At 3pm, Hermione arrived at Godric’s Hollow to the Dumbledore cottage. There, she found Albus, Piksy &amp; Lucky (who’d now become best friends), her work friend Eulessia Baron, Brutus Quintus, Doris Diggle, Septimus &amp; Cedrella Black (&amp; little Bilius), Minister Moon (to her surprise), Albus’ friend Professor Slughorn (much younger than Hermione remembered), and a few other work and ministry acquaintances she’d met throughout the past nine months. It was a jovial little garden party, and Hermione felt that she almost forgot for a brief while that she missed home.</p><p><em>Almost</em>.</p><p>Piksy and Lucky had decorated the garden with magical fairy lights and enchanted candles, and had set up a long wooden table with elaborate settings and floral arrangements. The feast spread out on the long table rivaled Hogwarts’ welcome feast in the Great Hall.</p><p>After they’d all eaten and broken open the fairy wine, Alphard Black arrived. </p><p>“I hope you don’t mind,” he said, his eyes sparkling. “Dumbledore invited me.”</p><p>“Oh,” Hermione murmured with an awkward smile. “Not at all. I’m glad you came.”</p><p>Hermione knew she had better have a talk with him before the night was over.</p><p>Cedrella Black gifted Hermione with several rare plants for her terrace, which  Hermione thought was a perfect and most thoughtful gift.</p><p>Brutus and Doris gifted her with a freshly minted set of coins; the first ever minted by the new bank. Hermione got teary-eyed looking at them. She gave them both heartfelt hugs.</p><p>Piksy, with her own earned wages, gifted Hermione with a new set of baking dishes and utensils (which Hermione thought was really a gift for Piksy as well) but Hermione thought it was really one of the sweetest and most rewarding presents she’d ever gotten. Piksy was bursting with pride that she was able to give her employer (Piksy still preferred Mistress) a gift all on her own. She’d put up a fight at first, but in recent months had taken to freedom rather well. She and Lucky were glowing with pride to be among the first freed house elves in Britain.</p><p>After Hermione had opened the other gifts, which primarily consisted of rare and limited edition copies of books (Hermione was <em> not </em> complaining), the guests began cracking open another bottle of elf-made wine which was brought by Alphard. The dusk was beginning to settle when Dumbledore pulled her aside and handed her a small box. </p><p>“What is this?” Hermione asked, looking at him in bemusement. </p><p>His crystal blue eyes met hers. “Open it.”</p><p>With excitement and some trepidation, she untied the bow and opened the filigree box. Inside, there was an ornate antique gold ring inlaid with pearls and diamonds.</p><p>“Oh, how beautiful, Albus!” Hermione muttered breathlessly. “Where did you get this?”</p><p>Albus eyed her piercingly, gauging her reaction carefully. “This is a family heirloom, Hermione. It has been passed down through the Dumbledore family for centuries. It was given to my mother, Kendra, by my father Percival when they were married. My mother had bequeathed it to me in hopes that I would give it to my wife, and then perhaps my children one day. But I think you and I both know there will be no wife, nor children.” He gazed at Hermione. He lowered his voice, although they were out of earshot of the other guests. “I hope you don’t mind my giving you this. I know you have a family that you hope to return to one day. I’ll admit, at first I had my reservations about our arrangement, but I knew that it was the best option for your safety at the time. However, over these past months… to me, you have become Hermione Granger-Dumbledore. I’ve come to care for you very deeply.”</p><p>Hermione’s eyes filled with tears as she stared at the ring. She blinked and they spilled over. Her bottom lip trembled.</p><p>She suddenly threw her arms around Albus’ neck and wept profusely into his shoulder. His face registered surprise for a moment at her emotional reaction; then, he wrapped his arms around her in return. The other guests cast a few glances their way, but did not interrupt what seemed to be a heartwarming moment between a father and his long-lost daughter.</p><p>When Hermione had finished soaking the shoulder of his golden robes with her tears, Albus passed her off to Alphard Black, whom he had assumed was her current romantic entanglement. Like most fathers, he was quite unable to keep up with his daughter’s love life. Hermione wasn’t offended in the slightest.</p><p>“Happy birthday, Hermione,” Alphard grinned. He handed her a box which Hermione already knew resembled a jewelry box.</p><p>“You shouldn’t have,” she muttered awkwardly as she opened it.</p><p>Inside the box, on a bed of green velvet, was a sparkling diamond bracelet.</p><p>“I couldn’t very well show up at such a special witch’s birthday party empty-handed, now could I? I also vaguely remember you predicting more diamond’s in your future.”</p><p>Hermione’s mouth fell open. “I… Alphard, it’s beautiful and I appreciate your generosity, but… I can’t accept it.”</p><p>“Of course you can,” he laughed.</p><p>“No, I can’t,” she murmured soberly.</p><p>His face suddenly grew serious, mirroring her own. “Why ever not?”</p><p>Hermione glanced around. “Could we take a walk?”</p><p>He blinked several times, then nodded. </p><p>He guided her out of the garden and through the front gate onto the sidewalk, and they began to walk down the street.</p><p>“Alphard, I need to tell you something, and I’m not sure how to say it.”</p><p>He was quiet for several moments.</p><p>At length, he spoke. “Why do I get a feeling I’m not going to like what you’ll have to say?”</p><p>Hermione took a deep breath and then turned to him. She pushed the box back into his hands. “Because I don’t think you will.”</p><p>He stood staring down at the box in his hands. “Are you ending things with me?”</p><p>Hermione heaved a deep breath, uncertain how to proceed. She shook her head, trying to decide what words to say.</p><p>“Hermione,” he interjected. “You said that you would give this a chance.”</p><p>She held her hands out, completely at a loss. “I’m sorry, Alphard, but… I think it’s… too <em> late </em> for that now.”</p><p>He cocked his head, eyes narrowing. “Riddle?” he asked acidly.</p><p>Hermione met his gaze with a plea in her own eyes. She nodded.</p><p>His jaw tensed. “I see.”</p><p>Hermione wanted to crawl in a hole and die. “I’m so sorry, Alphard.”</p><p>“So your relationship with Riddle is… progressing, then?”</p><p>Hermione looked away awkwardly, swallowing. </p><p>He nodded, taking her silence as an affirmation. “Will you go see him tonight, then?”</p><p>Hermione froze. “I don’t see how that’s pertinent to this conversation… but yes.”</p><p>He laughed bitterly under his breath. “I see.”</p><p>They stood awkwardly. Hermione closed her eyes.</p><p>“Did you sleep with him?” He asked with an edge of anger in his tone.</p><p>Her eyes snapped back open. “I don’t think that’s any of your business, whether I did or didn’t.”</p><p>He stared at her, exhaling. “You know I’m just worried about you, Hermione. You don’t know what he’s really like.”</p><p>Her expression was somewhat abashed. “I do, <em> actually </em>. But… it’s just unavoidable now.”</p><p>He watched her carefully. “So… you really see it going somewhere, then? With Riddle?”</p><p>She shook her head. “I don’t know where it will go, Alphard. I don’t have high hopes. But I will do the right thing by you, regardless.”</p><p>Alphard gazed at her. </p><p>He reached out a hand and brushed his knuckles across her cheek. “I’m disappointed, Hermione.”</p><p>She reached up and touched his hand with hers, then locked eyes with his. “I’m sorry. I really am. For what it’s worth, I’m disappointed, too.”</p><p>After a moment, he dropped his hand. “I suppose I should’ve anticipated it. But, Hermione… do be careful. I cannot stress it enough.”</p><p>Hermione nodded, unsure of what else to say. He was <em> right </em>, of course. But there was no telling that to her heart.</p><p>“Happy birthday, Hermione,” he said with a sad smile.</p><p>Then, he stood back and apparated away.</p><p>Hermione sat on the curb for a while with her head in her hands, feeling like the worst person in the universe. </p><p>She knew she was making mistakes, but she also felt that there was something quite beautiful and human about that.</p><p> </p><hr/><p><br/>
At around 7:30pm, Hermione knocked on the door of Tom Riddle’s flat. A minute later, he opened the door. She was surprised to see him looking quite casual in a white crewneck tee shirt tucked into black trousers. The shirt hugged his chest and arms and she realized that her previous assessment of him as “too thin” was a bit of a hasty judgment. She was too used to seeing him in his robes and work clothing. He cut a very nice figure and it reminded her of the morning in Bulgaria when he’d walked out shirtless in only a towel. </p><p>He was quite fit, she decided with finality.</p><p>He was smoking a half-finished cigarette.</p><p>“You <em> would </em> live on Knockturn Alley,” she said, feigning irritation.</p><p>He grinned. “Are you scared?”</p><p>“Of course not. I’m here, aren’t I?”</p><p>He escorted her into his flat and she looked around her. It was much the same as she’d imagined it. Not too small, but not overly large either. The floors were a warm-toned hardwood. It was bare and sparsely furnished. Clean. The bookcase against the far wall was stacked and nearly bowing beneath the weight of all his books. He’d turned some of them on their sides to fit them in on top of the rest. There was a little fireplace, which lent the room a cozy feel. She imagined it was connected to the floo network, as hers was. </p><p> “So this is your flat?”</p><p>“It is.”</p><p>Hermione nodded.</p><p>There was a sofa and an armchair. He sat in the armchair as he faced her, watching as she wandered about the main room. She scanned the books on the bookshelf, then looked out the window at the winding street filled with skulking figures below.</p><p>“How was the party?”</p><p>“Oh,” she said, turning around to face him. “It was lovely. Just work friends and… my father.” It didn’t feel quite so strange to say it, after tonight.</p><p>“It’s later than I expected,” he muttered. “You took a while getting here.” There was a question in his statement.</p><p>“I-” Hermione began, but she had a hard time forming the words. “I was with Alphard Black.”</p><p>He cocked his head, eyes narrowing. His eyebrows lifted, his gaze was questioning.</p><p>She swallowed and looked down at her hands. “I ended things… with him.”</p><p>Tom watched her, searching her face for several moments. Then, his eyes darkened and flicked downward over her body. “Do you know why I asked you to come tonight?”</p><p>She glanced at him warily. Then, she nodded slowly. “I think so.”</p><p>He nodded. “Take your clothes off, Hermione.”</p><p>Her eyes widened. She stood staring at him awkwardly, her heart pounding as if it could escape her chest cavity. She had expected this, but not quite so suddenly. Her fingers toyed nervously with the charms of the bracelet on her wrist.</p><p>“Now?” she asked.</p><p>He nodded. He continued to sit, staring at her. After a moment, he cocked an eyebrow, as if to ask, ‘What are you waiting for?’</p><p>Hermione looked around herself, then back to him. She took his stare as a challenge. </p><p>Apprehensively, she stepped out of her pumps. Her hands trembled as they rose to the top of her dress and began to undo the buttons. She unbelted the sash around her waist. Then, she slid her pantyhose off her waist and stepped out of them gingerly.</p><p>She never stopped shaking. Hermione was not really the sort to be nervous, but the nature of what he asked her to do, paired with the way he sat staring at her, watching her like a predator observing prey… coupled with the anticipation of what would come next, it had her feeling dizzy.</p><p>She pulled her arms out of the dress and pushed it down over her waist, letting it fall to the floor around her ankles. She stepped out of it and kicked it aside. She was left in her undergarments, which were cut from a lavender chantilly lace. They were the latest French styles, which Hermione had opted for because they reminded her of the more modern styles of her own time rather than the too modest sort that women of the forties favored. </p><p>His eyes roamed over her, taking in the frilly, risqué lingerie. His face was blank. </p><p>After a moment, he tilted his head. “Take those off.”</p><p>Her lips parted, and she blinked once, then twice. </p><p><em> You’ve already had sex with him once, </em> Hermione chided herself. <em> There’s no reason to be embarrassed.</em></p><p>His eyes bore into hers as if he could read her thoughts. She realized that he wanted her to feel unnerved. </p><p>She lifted her chin, staring back at him boldly as she unclipped her bra and tossed it aside, and then made eye contact, allowing her brown eyes to meet his obsidian ones boldly as she slowly slid the little lace panties down over her hips and discarded those as well.</p><p>His lips turned up in the barest hint of a smirk as his eyes slowly began to slide down over her body. He gave no hint of an expression, but she noticed his nostrils flared imperceptibly. His eyes raked over her legs, then traced the contours of her hips, and lingered longer over her breasts. </p><p>After a moment, he stood and walked toward her slowly. She let her eyes wander him as well, hungrily observing his purposeful gait and the pleasing proportion of his shoulders. Her eyes fell to his hands. There was something so erotic about them; she couldn’t stop her gaze from searching for them every time he was near.</p><p>He circled her and moved to stand behind her. He reached up and laid his hands on her shoulders, then she felt him lean into her. The sudden warmth of his presence behind her gave her butterflies. She turned her head slightly when she felt his breath on her neck. He took one hand off her shoulder, and then a moment later, he held his fist out in front of her face. Then, a little gold chain and pendant  fell down from his fist, dangling in front of her eyes. </p><p>“What’s this?” Hermione whispered.</p><p>Tom reached around her and unclasped the necklace. He laid it around her neck and fastened it deftly. His fingertips brushed her skin, sending a shiver down her spine.</p><p>“Happy birthday, little witch.”</p><p>She looked down at the pendant around her neck. Suspended on a delicate gold chain was a golden Phoenix. Wrapping itself around the Phoenix was a delicate silver serpent. The detail of the craftsmanship was extraordinary.</p><p>Hermione lifted her hand and let her fingertips brush over the pendant. It was so delicately wrought, she knew it must have been custom made. She couldn’t think of anywhere he would have gotten something like it; it was far too specific. It was clearly meant to be a replacement for her usual Phoenix pendant that Ron had given her, as well as the serpent she’d worn at Malfoy Manor, given to her by Alphard.</p><p>She held back a smile. Despite his obvious intent to brand her with his own piece of jewelry, she found it rather endearing that he’d thought of her birthday far enough in advance to have something made specifically for her.</p><p>She did find the piece quite beautiful. In fact, it was one of the most lovely pieces of jewelry she had ever seen. It was much more her style as it was simple and delicate, not gaudy or flashy like the jewelry Alphard had given her.</p><p>It was also a conscious romantic effort that she hadn’t thought Riddle capable of.</p><p>“Now your birthday suit is complete,” he murmured with a smirk. He ran his knuckles along her arm, causing her skin to tingle. “I must say, I’m rather partial to it. Perhaps I should ban you from wearing clothes whenever you visit my flat.”</p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes. “I find it funny you think you could order me around.”</p><p>He grinned, but said nothing. He simply let his eyes roam her for a few more moments, then he brushed her hair aside. “Let me ask you a question. It’s been, what? Ten days since Bulgaria?”</p><p>She thought for a moment, then nodded her head.  Her cheeks reddened at the mention of their last rendezvous.</p><p>Tom ran his tongue over his incisors. “Tell me… Have you touched yourself since then?”</p><p>Hermione’s brows lifted sharply and her head snapped to the side. “Excuse me?”</p><p>He simply stared at her. </p><p>She swallowed. “Y-You mean…”</p><p>He nodded. </p><p>Her mouth fell open. “I…”</p><p>“It’s a simple question. Yes, or no. Have you, or haven’t you?”</p><p>She averted her eyes and nodded, mortified by his question. Why was she so embarrassed? It was absolutely ridiculous.</p><p>The corners of his lips turned up. He cleared his throat. “And what did you think about?”</p><p>Her head whipped to the side again to look at him. “Um, no… just, <em> no </em>.”</p><p>He smirked, his black eyes glittering. “Are you embarrassed?”</p><p>“No!” She snapped. “It’s just none of your business.”</p><p>He chuckled. “Hermione, everything about you is my business.”</p><p>She glared at him. “You’re obnoxious.”</p><p>He nodded. “Mhmm. Right. Except here you are, in my flat.” He looked her up and down. “Completely naked, I’d like to add.”</p><p>Hermione huffed. “This was a mistake.”</p><p>“Tell me what you thought of.”</p><p>“No,” she murmured, casting an apprehensive glance his way.</p><p>His tone sharpened. “Don’t make me use legilimency.”</p><p>Her eyes got very wide, but she scoffed in a weak attempt at bravery. “You’re welcome to try.”</p><p>He smiled. “Hermione, you saw how I was able to apparate across continents. Believe me when I tell you that if I decided to penetrate your mind, you wouldn’t be able to keep me out. I know you’re hiding things. I could look into your mind right now if I chose. I could know everything you seek to keep from me. The only thing protecting your secrets is my mercy. Now… tell me what you thought of.”</p><p>Hermione swallowed. She knew he was telling her the truth. Voldemort was one of the most powerful natural Legilimens who ever lived. But why hadn’t he used his power on her yet? It made no sense.</p><p>“Hermione.” His voice was hard.</p><p>Her heart hammered in her chest. She swallowed and she looked down at her feet. “I- I thought about your hands.”</p><p>He gazed at her for a moment in silence. Then, he spoke. “Go on.”</p><p>She turned her head to look at him. Hermione couldn’t believe his nerve. </p><p>He took a step forward, then lifted his hand to her face, tilting her chin upward as he dragged his thumb across her bottom lip. “Go on, <em> Hermione </em>.”</p><p>She blinked. “I- I was thinking about your fingers… inside me. How it felt at Malfoy Manor. I was thinking about how… how your ring might feel.”</p><p>His eyebrows lifted. He held up his hand in front of her. “This ring?”</p><p>She gazed at the Gaunt ring… his horcrux. Her heart pounded. </p><p>She nodded.</p><p>He moved behind her. “Go on, Hermione.”</p><p>“I was just…” </p><p>He wrapped his arms around her and snaked his hand between her legs. </p><p>“I…”  She lost her train of thought.</p><p>His fingers brushed against her entrance, and she felt the shockingly cold metal of his ring brush against her. </p><p>“Keep going, Hermione.”</p><p>She cleared her throat, her breathing stilted. “I was just thinking about how it would feel… inside me… and I thought about your voice.”</p><p>She felt his breath against her ear. “My voice?”</p><p>She shivered, then nodded. His finger suddenly parted her folds and slipped inside her. </p><p>Hermione bit her lip.</p><p>He made a little ‘tsk’ sound. “You’re already so wet, Hermione. Do you hear that?” He slid his finger deeper, then curled it as he pulled it back. There was a distinct wet sound as he withdrew it.</p><p>She felt she should be embarrassed, but now her entire body was on fire, so she only found it intensely erotic.</p><p>This feeling was entirely new to Hermione. </p><p>“What else?”</p><p>Her mouth fell open as he slid another finger inside her. “Um…” Her voice was shaky. “I was thinking about the way you smell.”</p><p>He chuckled under his breath. “Do you like the way I smell, Hermione?”</p><p>She nodded. “Yes,” she replied in a soft whisper. She hated the way her body reacted when he said her name.</p><p>He kissed her shoulder. “The feeling is mutual.” He took a section of her hair in his hand and lifted it, inhaling its scent. “I like the way you smell too, little witch. You smell distinctly… mine.” </p><p>At that moment, he withdrew his fingers slightly to slide his ring down over his knuckle and then turned it around to face the inside of his palm. Then he slipped his finger back inside her. </p><p>Hermione felt when his ring pressed within her warm walls. Her mouth fell open at the sensation of the cold, foreign object entering her soft cavity.</p><p>“Um-“ she choked. As he pumped his fingers in and out, the smooth black stone rubbed against her clit. Her head fell back over his shoulder. </p><p>“Fuck,” she breathed. </p><p>His other hand, which had been resting on her stomach, snaked down and began to circle around her clit. </p><p>Her breathing became heavy, and she bit her lip to stop herself from moaning.</p><p>“Don’t do that,” he muttered. “Let me hear you.”</p><p>He slid his long fingers deeper inside her. She couldn’t hold back the moan that escaped her throat. </p><p>“Good girl,” he breathed. “Tell me when you’re about to come.”</p><p>She leaned back against him, letting him support some of her weight as she was having difficulty standing. The tension was building deliciously and the feeling of his ring sliding in and out was creating a friction that was both uncomfortable and intensely arousing all at once. </p><p>Truth be told, she liked the discomfort.</p><p>Perhaps Tom was right, and she liked a little pain.</p><p>He seemed to know what she liked better than she did.</p><p>His fingers were working her clit expertly, and she was surprised at how well he understood the technique. In fact, it irked her, because she kept imagining him using the same tricks on Walburga Black and it made her feel painfully inadequate, because she herself had absolutely zero experience of her own. She hated the thought that he’d possibly done the same thing to Walburga. It was the not knowing that bothered her.</p><p>She knew it was an insecurity so she shoved it down deep. </p><p>“Tom,” she whispered. </p><p>“What, little witch?”</p><p>She bit her lip. “I’m- I’m about to come…”</p><p>As soon as she said it, he stopped.</p><p>She whimpered as he withdrew his fingers and brought them to her lips. </p><p>“Open your mouth.”</p><p>She stared at his fingers, then slowly parted her lips. He pushed his fingers between them and over her tongue.</p><p>“Suck.”</p><p>Hermione’s eyes widened but she did as he instructed. She hesitantly wrapped her lips around his fingers, the metallic taste of his ring on her tongue mixed with the sweeter taste of herself. She let her instincts guide her as she slid her tongue against his fingers, then took them deeper. </p><p>She heard a rumble deep within his chest, like a groan. The sound triggered butterflies in her stomach and encouraged her. She slid his fingers in and out of her mouth a few times and let out a saucy moan. </p><p>“Fuck, witch,” he muttered hoarsely.</p><p>At that, he slid his fingers deeper, over her tongue, until they hit the back of her throat. After a moment, they triggered her gag reflex and she coughed, struggling against him until he pulled them back, a string of saliva dripping from them.</p><p>“Good girl,” he purred. She swallowed once and then he slid them back in, once again shoving them into her throat roughly. She moaned against his fingers and then she began to fight the reflex once more. She choked and he withdrew them. </p><p>He bent and hooked his arm under her knees, then lifted her into his arms. He carried her across the room and laid her on the sofa. Then he knelt in front of her.</p><p>“Spread your legs.”</p><p>Hermione hesitated, her knees bent and tightly locked together. His eyes narrowed. Of course, they’d already had sex once. She knew she shouldn’t feel shy… But to have him kneeling in front of her, it felt too intimate and personal. Her heart beat rapidly in her chest. </p><p>His jaw tensed. Suddenly, there were hands ripping her knees apart and spreading her legs wide. Except, they weren’t his hands. </p><p>There were no hands.</p><p>“How did you-“</p><p>“Be quiet.” He was staring at her now. </p><p>Hermione’s face turned beet red. She turned her face to the side nervously, unwilling to meet his gaze. </p><p>He slid his finger inside her. “So tight,” he muttered. “Perfection… I’m afraid it’s going to hurt when I have to stretch you again.”</p><p>Hermione’s mouth fell open at the bold way he spoke to her. It seemed so disrespectful and yet, she found herself even more aroused by it.</p><p>He leaned forward and kissed the soft flesh of her inner thigh, then sunk his teeth in roughly. Hermione gasped and jerked slightly, but the phantom hands held her down and kept her legs spread for him. Her heart thundered in her chest. <em> Fear </em>.</p><p>“When? You mean, <em> if </em>,” she murmured breathlessly.</p><p>He smirked, but said nothing, as if he could sense there was very little substance to her bravado.</p><p>He slid another finger inside her, then attempted another, but it didn’t quite fit. He moved them in and out, shallowly thrusting them as his thumb circled her clit. Her cheeks turned pink as the wet sounds filled the quiet room, but she couldn’t keep her hips from grinding against his hand, her hunger mounting toward the wicked pleasure he was giving her.</p><p>He suddenly withdrew his fingers and she whimpered, “Don’t stop.”</p><p>“Quiet.” His voice was sure, but as she lifted her eyes to his, she found them glinting black with lust in the dim light.</p><p>He dipped to his knees before her and she furrowed her brow. Suddenly, she could feel his hot breath against her wet center and she swallowed, feeling anxious at being bare before him. He hooked his hands around the backs of her knees and lifted her thighs over his shoulder. Before she was ready, his tongue met her warmth and she moaned in surprise at the intense sensation of his mouth upon her. His lips sucked at her sensitive flesh, his tongue parting her folds and sliding up along the seam of her opening. His tongue then darted inside her, pulsing in and out. Hermione’s mouth fell open as she realized Tom was fucking her with his tongue. It felt rushed and in slow motion all at once.</p><p>Hermione heard a deep sound from his chest and she felt the vibration of it against herself, causing a ricochet of pleasure inside her body. </p><p>Hermione was glad for the dim lighting because she blushed hard; her fear was rapidly being replaced by ravenous hunger as his teeth grazed her soft flesh and his fingers dug into her thighs mercilessly. He inclined his head and his noze brushed against her clit, causing her to jerk as pressure mounted between her legs unbearably. She felt so sensitive that she might explode.</p><p>“Tom,” she moaned, unsure whether she wanted to beg him to stop or to keep going. </p><p>“Wrong name, Hermione,” Tom muttered hoarsely.</p><p>Her breathing was becoming stilted. “Voldemort,” she whispered.</p><p>“Such a <em> good </em> little witch.” She could feel the rumbling of his voice against her and the praise sent a shockwave of pleasure through her entire body. She felt electric, full of an energy she’d never felt in her entire life. Even pleasuring herself had never once felt this good.</p><p>His tongue pulsed against her clit and her hips twitched. He followed by inserting two fingers inside her and she moaned loudly, her legs shaking. </p><p>Her voice trembled at a higher pitch than normal as she gasped, “I’m about to-”</p><p>“No,” Tom growled. “Not yet.”</p><p>She swallowed thickly. “Please,” she whispered, out of breath as her whole body tightened and tensed with the strain of holding back.</p><p>“Do not come until I say, Hermione,” he said sternly. He applied more pressure with his tongue, pumping his fingers in and out of her furiously. A desperate moan escaped her throat as she fought to keep release at bay. The pressure began to mount painfully, and she felt so sensitive that she cried out, but he still would not relent. In fact, the more her body tensed with pleasure and the need to let go, the more ruthless he was.</p><p>Hermione made the mistake of looking down. The sight of Tom between her legs did something to her. It wasn’t the image of him on his knees pleasuring her that did it… It was the knowledge that he was <em> controlling </em> her pleasure, that he was expertly calculating each movement, that he knew <em> exactly </em> what to do and how to do it, and the fact that he was enjoying this total control over her body, enjoying her submission to his every whim… that whatever happened to Hermione was because <em> he </em> willed it to be… It was all of this knowledge that sent Hermione over the edge.</p><p>“Oh my god,” she gasped, having no choice but to let go. The explosion rocketed through her core and fanned throughout her body in waves. She let out a cry as white stars burst behind her eyes, clouding her vision. Her breathing grew jagged and her body was racked. Hermione couldn’t believe he’d rung such a powerful orgasm from her with only his mouth and hands. She’d never felt anything like it.</p><p>As Hermione came down to reality, she was alarmed as she remembered that he had commanded her not to come just before the explosion of what was likely the most intense orgasm of her life. She swallowed as she looked down at him. He was very still. “I’m sorry… I couldn’t-”</p><p>“Quiet.”</p><p>Her lips parted as she looked at him. His jaw tensed.</p><p>“Tom...”</p><p>“What, little witch?”</p><p>“Kiss me.”</p><p>He laughed sadistically. “Do you think you deserve that?”</p><p>Her heart pounded. His words caused a foreign excitement to shiver through her body. “It is still my birthday.”</p><p>He chuckled under his breath. “Perhaps I’ll forgive your disobedience then. This time.”</p><p>The caustic edge to his voice vibrated through her, lighting her on fire again. Despite the fact that she had just finished, hunger began to pound in her body again. <em> How </em> was he able to do this to her?</p><p>Her eyes met his in the dimness.</p><p>“Please,” she murmured. </p><p>He leaned over her, his hips settling in between hers as he bent down and covered her mouth with his. His lips were insistent, hungry, cruel. She moaned softly. </p><p>He gripped her breast, squeezing it roughly as he ran his thumb over her nipple. He broke the kiss to mutter, “You deserve to be punished, Hermione. Do you know why?”</p><p>She breathed heavily and reached up to touch his cheekbones with her fingertips. “I couldn’t help it.”</p><p>He nodded, then his hand left her breast and reached up to wrap his long fingers around her throat. He leaned down to mutter in her ear, “I don’t fucking like it when you disobey me, Hermione.”</p><p>The sharpness of his voice should’ve evoked fear in her heart, but she felt a shiver of anticipation go down her spine. This Tom was so different from the man who flirted with her during work hours. It didn’t bother her. She surprised herself, because she found that she loved seeing this side of him. She looked at him with wide eyes. Her body should have felt sated, but instead, it responded to the brutal pressure of his fingers around her throat, the heat of his body upon hers, and the pressure of his cock against her hips, hard and bulging in his trousers.</p><p>“Then, punish me,” she whispered. </p><p>His grin was sinister as it spread slowly across his face. “You’d be terrified if you knew the things I want to do to you, little witch.”</p><p>Hermione should’ve felt afraid. This man was her enemy, a cruel and evil person. The villain of every nightmare she’d ever had. And yet, she only felt challenged. </p><p>His gaze raked over her body, his dark eyes glowing in the darkness. His flat had gone dark as the evening light faded from the windows. Her nipples grew taut under the boldness of his stare.</p><p>He lowered his mouth to her breast, his tongue tracing its curve and then flicked at her nipple. She arched against him, craving more, and found herself surprised at her own appetite. This was not a version of herself that Hermione was familiar with.</p><p>Then he began unbuckling his belt. She knew because she could hear the clink of the metal, followed by the sound of his zipper, and the eroticism of it elicited a soft moan from her throat. Within moments, the head of his cock was pressed to her soft entrance. Her eyes snapped open wide at the hardness of it, the sheer size of him threatening to invade and stretch her. Suddenly, her face felt hot and she shifted beneath him, the slickness between her legs aching to be filled with him.</p><p>She didn’t care if it hurt. She <em> wanted </em> it to hurt.</p><p>Who was this new witch he had turned her into? She didn’t recognize herself. Shamelessly, she squirmed beneath him, her body hungry and begging.</p><p>“Please,” she whispered.</p><p>His jaw tensed, nostrils flaring as he shook his head. “Fuck,” he gritted.</p><p>He did nothing, but stared down at her for what felt like eternity. He seemed to be almost at war with himself, because the moments dragged on painfully. She breathed heavily and pitched her hips forward, trying to feel more of him against her. He grabbed her hips in a bruising grip and held her still. “I need you to come back tomorrow night, Hermione.”</p><p>She grew very still. “I-”</p><p>“Say it.”</p><p>She swallowed. “That’s… that’s not a good idea.”</p><p>“I want you to come back tomorrow.” He said it very slowly. “Say you will.”</p><p>He pressed himself forward, teasing her opening. Her lips parted, breathless at the devastating sensation of <em> him </em>. She threw her head back. “Tom…”</p><p>“Say it,” he snapped. </p><p>“I will. I’ll come.”</p><p>His hand tightened around her throat. Then, he covered her mouth with his, and it felt as though their souls were merging through their lips. </p><p>Then, he suddenly pulled away from her. She started to protest as her entire body reacted to the loss of his warmth, but she clamped down on the instinct. She heard the zipper, then the clink of his belt. Then he sat back on his knees, and stood. </p><p>He looked down at her and his expression was unreadable. </p><p>“Go home, Hermione.”</p><p>Her mouth fell open in shock. </p><p>Then, her chest began to heave angrily. </p><p>She stood, crossing the room quickly, and began to put on her clothing. Then she stood facing him with thinly veiled rage. He looked back at her blankly. </p><p>“I expect you back here tomorrow night,” he said as he opened the door for her.</p><p>Her eyes snapped with fury. They wandered his face, searching for some sort of explanation, but there was none. His face was an emotionless mask.</p><p>She shook her head disbelievingly, then turned and stormed out of his flat, yanking the door free of his grasp and slamming it on her way out. </p><p>Tom stood in silence for several minutes. He gritted his teeth and closed his eyes.</p><p>He was angry with himself.</p><p>His compulsive need for complete control and dominance had spun out of control. </p><p>He had a psychotic need for balance; each cause <em> demanded </em> an effect.</p><p>Disobedience demanded <em> punishment </em>. </p><p>It was a compulsive behavior of his which had dominated his life.</p><p>Up until now, that behavior had never warred with what he wanted.</p><p>But tonight, he had wanted Hermione.</p><p>He’d wanted nothing more than to give her what she craved.</p><p>He had never desired to possess something so badly as he wanted to possess her.</p><p>Not even his horcruxes could match the hunger he had for her.</p><p>She had ended her dalliance with Black. For him. She had come to his flat and offered herself up so willingly.</p><p>He could’ve had her… he could’ve had what he had craved for months.</p><p>But the insistent itch which demanded balance, which demanded <em> recompense </em>, even for the slightest infraction, it terrorized him.</p><p>He saw red. His entire body locked up in a compulsive vice which he could not fight.</p><p>In that moment, he truly hated himself. His compulsion had become a weakness, a liability.</p><p>Now, she was angry. </p><p>He would have to make it up to her.</p><p>But he couldn’t tonight.</p><p>Tonight, he had to punish her, as much as it pained and frustrated him.</p><p>How could he fix himself? Tom was so broken beyond repair that he feared he would eventually break her as well.</p><p>He made his way into his bedroom and sank down onto the bed, exhausted and tense. Since when had he not been in control of his own actions and deeds?</p><p>His body ached with the need for release.</p><p>He wanted her here, in his bed. He craved her body against his.</p><p>Yet Tom laid alone, in the darkness.</p><p>The darkness, it seemed, was his only companion.</p><p>It had been that way for as long as he could remember.</p><p>“Goodnight, little witch,” he murmured into the stillness of the night.<br/>
<br/>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p><br/>
Hermione lay in bed that night, staring through the floor-to-ceiling windows of her bedroom.</p><p>It was silent, and she felt hot with shame and disappointment. She tried to hold together the tattered remnants of her dignity as she gazed through the glass wall.</p><p>The moon shone, opalescent against the onyx night, casting a glow across the jagged skyline of London. Starlight reflected in the black water of the pool on her terrace, and farther out, the lights of the city glittered.</p><p>What was this man doing to her?</p><p>She thought of his hands on her, his tongue inside her, and shivered. Then she thought of the void of him, the feeling of him pulling out of her, of him moving away from her, of the empty space of her life where only she resided before. Now it felt as if that space was filled with nothing but insatiable hunger. For <em> him </em>. It was inexplicable, because she feared him… and yet, in that fear, she felt the safest she’d ever felt.</p><p>“Perhaps I need a mind healer<em> , </em> ” she murmured softly in the darkness. <em> Perhaps the war did more damage to me than I’m aware of. </em></p><p>She rose from the bed with a sigh, and wandered to the windows. A painful emptiness crept in as she gazed out to the sector of the wizarding district where she knew he was. The darkness of Knockturn Alley.</p><p><em> Is he playing a game with me? </em> she wondered.</p><p>She knew he was punishing her. She had imagined his punishment to mean pain. <em> Pain </em> she could handle. Even some degree of degradation. But the punishment she expected was not the punishment he gave.</p><p>This… this <em> lack </em> of him. The absence of him. It was worse than anything else he could have concocted. Rejection threatened to drown her. Did he know this? Had he read Hermione like a book? Was he so skilled in the subtle art of manipulation that he knew precisely how to break her down? Was he reading her in that moment when he was at war with himself, or was he also battling his own lust as she was?</p><p>She felt rebellion rising up within her. She wanted nothing more than to chuck his parchment in the fireplace and be done with him. But he had made her swear to return the following night… as if he’d known what her reaction would be. He’d accused her of toying with him… but now Hermione felt toyed with. Was this revenge upon her for her kiss with Alphard Black?</p><p>None of it set right.</p><p>She felt as if she were finally getting a limited view of the darker side of him; the sick and twisted individual that he truly was at his core.</p><p>Had he been hiding himself up until now?</p><p>Questions plagued Hermione. </p><p>She suddenly pitied him; she didn’t want to pity him, but it rose up within her like a tidal wave of emotion. </p><p>She wanted to know him. <em> Really </em> know him.</p><p>She already knew the monster; the murderer. The creature whose soul was so ripped apart and mangled that he was literally unrecognizable from the man she knew now.</p><p>She wanted to know the lost, broken boy that had grown up cast off and unwanted in the orphanage. Abandoned by his father. She wanted to know the brilliant wizard who had achieved impossible feats of magic at a tender age with no real guidance or mentor. She wanted to know Tom Riddle <em> intimately </em>.</p><p>She shocked herself by wanting this. </p><p>Hermione didn’t know if she could help him, or change him...</p><p>… she simply wanted to <em> know </em> him.</p><p>She fingered the pendant he’d given her absently. Despite how angry she’d been, she hadn’t taken it off.</p><p>It stayed, like a leash around her neck.</p><p>She was his, after all; undeniably.</p><p>She felt it deep in her soul.</p><p>But was he also <em> hers </em>?</p><p>Hermione smiled to herself. </p><p>He would be. </p><p>She determined that she would dig her talons so deeply into his soul so that he would be wrapped tightly around her finger. Then, he would <em> give </em> her his horcruxes as presents. </p><p>She only needed to be clever and strong, and bide her time.</p><p>Hermione was no ordinary witch. She was <em> not </em> Walburga Black.</p><p>She was Hermione Granger-Dumbledore, the brightest witch of her age.</p><p>She ran her fingers over the Phoenix pendant.</p><p>Tom Riddle had no idea yet that he was playing with <em> fire </em>.</p><p><br/>

<br/>
</p><p>Hermione awoke feeling refreshed on Monday morning. It was as if the previous night with Riddle hadn’t even happened. </p><p>She sat at a little round breakfast table by the wall of windows, looking out over the terrace. She usually had her morning tea outside, but it was getting nippier in the mornings, so she sat by the windows, gazing out at the city. </p><p>She decided not to think about Riddle today; she needed to focus on her next article. She desperately wanted to write about the breach at Azkaban prison, but the Auror department had warned her editor that publishing any stories about the breach could contribute to civil unrest. </p><p>Hermione didn’t like it. Journalists shouldn’t be able to dictate what the public should and shouldn’t be informed about. Isn’t this what she’d hated about The Prophet during her time? That the paper had been completely controlled by the Ministry, which in turn, was controlled by whatever political party was in power? Rita Skeeter had published whatever propaganda she was instructed to by the Ministry, and it disgusted Hermione. It had been a publication of lies and deceit, through and through. </p><p>Perhaps she would speak with Baumgartner about it. The least she could do was investigate the breach. Supposedly, the first-ever breaches of Azkaban prison had been in her time. First, when a young man escaped, followed closely by Sirius Black. Then, two years later, when many Death Eaters had been released in a series of mass breakouts.</p><p>But that wasn’t true, was it? This breach was the first, as far as Hermione was aware, but it hadn’t been reported on, so no one ever knew about it.</p><p>Hermione itched to investigate further.</p><p>Hermione dressed for work in a powder blue set of robes and as she walked by the table, she saw Tom’s parchment lying there. She smirked and walked right past it, leaving it on the table. </p><p>She promptly flooed to Diagon Alley.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Tom Riddle was frustrated.</p><p>It was clear that Hermione had no intention of responding to the messages he’d written her on the parchment throughout the morning.</p><p>“Do you think to punish <em> me </em>, little witch?” He muttered venomously. “You’ll regret that.”</p><p>If she didn’t come to his flat that night as she’d promised, he would go to her penthouse and extricate her himself.</p><p>He was in no mood for games.</p><p>He growled angrily as he rolled up the parchment and shoved it into the inner pocket of his robes.</p><p>No matter, he thought to himself. He needed to stay focused. He had told Borgin that he intended to visit a particular customer of theirs who had extensive knowledge of historical magical objects and relics in order to scope out new acquisitions. What he really intended to do, was find out more about the Ribbon of Life and where he could find one.</p><p>Then, later in the week, he had set a time to meet with his old Potions professor. Then, he would have the brewing instructions for the <em> Tears of Adonis </em> potion.</p><p>Tom would discover once and for all if Hermione was his soulmate. </p><p>One thing was absolutely certain: soulmate or not, Tom had decided that Hermione Dumbledore was his until she drew her very last breath.</p><p>Even if he had to shackle her to him.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Hermione sat in the office of Gaspard Dufresne, head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. He was a tall and imposing wizard with dark hair and large blue eyes. He had the slight shadow of a beard and wore a questionable amount of rings on each hand. He was quite handsome, Hermione mused; she estimated he was likely in his early forties.</p><p>She’d never been given such a difficult time by a wizard before.</p><p>“Like I’ve already stated, Mr. Dufresne, I am only trying to glean the cold hard truth. All I want are the facts. I’m not trying to spin a story, here,” she exhaled, already exasperated. Clearly, the wizard had been told to give her the runaround.</p><p>“I am telling you all that I know, Miss Dumbledore,” he said coolly. </p><p>Hermione gritted her teeth and set her jaw. “Let me explain something, <em> sir </em> . <em> The Prophet </em> will report on whatever it sees fit. My editor may or may not decide to run the story. However, if <em> you </em> do not give me the facts and cooperate with me on this, then I’ll be forced to find out the truth by my <em> own </em> means, which means I may hear and learn things that you would rather not have reported. If you and the Ministry as a whole want to get ahead of this story and have some level of control over what is being written, then give me the basics and I’ll be on my way.”</p><p>He leaned forward and narrowed his eyes. The older wizard seemed to be considering her. “Look, Dumbledore, all I know is that the prisoner who escaped had one visitor in the last five years. That visitor stopped by the very same month he disappeared. That visitor was a ministry worker by the name of Cyrus Pilloughby. He worked in the Department of Magical Transportation, he was a floater for both the Floo Network Authority and the Portkey Office.”</p><p>“What is his blood status?” Hermione asked. </p><p>“Half-blood.”</p><p>“How is the investigation proceeding?”</p><p>“There are no leads. We found some incriminating spells through performing Priori Incantanto upon his wand, thus leading us to believe that he somehow was the cause of the breach. However, all attempts at interrogation have been unsuccessful. We have gained no new information.”</p><p>“What spells?”</p><p>“That is classified information,” he replied tersely. </p><p>Hermione bit her lip. “What spells could possibly help a wizard to break through the wards of Azkaban prison? A supposedly <em> unbreachable </em> prison.”</p><p>He huffed. “We don’t believe he acted alone. We believe he had help, and it’s also possible that the prisoner was able to perform some obscure form of magic which allowed him to circumvent the wards of the prison.”</p><p>Hermione’s brow furrowed. “You mean, Dominik Hausler. How is that possible?”</p><p>“Look, journalist,” he said impatiently. “The investigation is still ongoing. We have very little information to go on. It was one of those situations where one minute, the prisoner was there, and the next minute, he was gone. Dementors don’t know a thing, <em> allegedly </em>. They won’t talk, which is suspicious in and of itself. The wards were all intact. It had to have been an inside job; that’s my own opinion. I don’t like any of it, but I’ve also got orders from the top. I’ve got red tape like all the other department heads. I can’t really say much else. That’s all I know.”</p><p>Hermione’s mouth pinched as she thought. “What do you believe to be Mr. Pilloughby’s motive?”</p><p>The auror held up his hands. “There really doesn’t seem to be one, aside from his political views.”</p><p>“And what are those?”</p><p>“Anti-muggle leaning. Blood supremacy allegiances.”</p><p>“But he’s a half-blood.”</p><p>Gaspard shrugged. “Make it make sense. There are many half-bloods who hold those views. The prisoner, Hausler, was a former general of Grindelwald’s. A very, <em> very </em> high-profile prisoner. He was put in one of the deepest dungeons in the prison. One with the strongest protective enchantments and wards.” He lowered his voice. “Don’t quote me on this. But if you want my honest opinion, I don’t think Cyrus is capable of something like this. This is the work of someone dangerous and well-connected. Someone very, <em> very </em> intelligent, with a very obscure magical skillset.”</p><p>Hermione swallowed. She knew someone that matched that description. Could Riddle be connected to this?</p><p>“Has Cyrus Pilloughby admitted to anything?”</p><p>“He denies having anything to do with it, of course. He even denies visiting the prison. But the guards have a record of him being there on a certain date and even have a registered trace on his wand as well. He was definitely there that day.”</p><p>Her brows knit thoughtfully, and she took a deep breath. “Have his memories been searched?”</p><p>The auror chuckled. “Are you sure you’re a reporter? You sound more and more like an auror.”</p><p>Hermione gave a wry smile. “In another life, perhaps I might’ve been.”</p><p>He looked her up and down thoughtfully. “That’s always on the table, I suppose, with your NEWT scores and family connections. As for Pilloughby, it’s possible that he was imperiused. We are fairly certain he was obliviated, because although it’s certain that he was at the prison, he has no memories of the visit. We haven’t been able to recover any of his memories. If he was indeed obliviated, the witch or wizard who did so is quite powerful.”</p><p>Hermione felt herself growing more and more suspicious. “May I be permitted to interview some of his co-workers?”</p><p>He gave a curt nod, then stood and showed her to the door. Before she left, he extended his hand and shook it, his sharp blue eyes meeting hers. “Come see me if you have any other questions… or want to interview for a position.”</p><p>Hermione fought back a smile. He’d certainly warmed up to her.</p><p>Her press escort took her to the sixth level of the Ministry Headquarters.</p><p>For about two hours, Hermione interviewed various co-workers of Cyrus Pilloughby, most of whom worked in either the Floo Network Authority, Portkey Office, or the Apparation Test Centre. </p><p>No one seemed to have any pertinent information. </p><p>Hermione asked the last witch she interviewed, “Is there anyone that Cyrus associated with from other departments? Perhaps someone he was close to, or had lunch with? Anyone you saw him with quite frequently?”</p><p>The blonde witch thought for a minute. “Well, there was a witch he’d just recently begun seeing after work a bit. She works for the Ministry research committee. Her name is Adria Prewett. Level One.”</p><p>Hermione thanked her and allowed her press escort to guide her to the research offices.</p><p>Hermione found herself seated before a short witch with pale, milky skin and brown eyes. Her hair was a tussle of wild, glossy red curls. She was quite pretty in an old-world kind of way.</p><p>“Hello, Mrs. Prewett. I’m Hermione Dumbledore-“</p><p>“Oh, I know who you are,” the witch interrupted in a girlish voice. “I read about you all the time in the papers.”</p><p>“<em> Oh </em>,” Hermione chuckled. “Good things, I hope.”</p><p>“All your outfits are photographed and what products you use and what designers you wear. I can never wait until after an event to see what you’ll wear!” She lowered her voice to a tiny whisper. “-and whose arm you’ll be on.” The witch grinned demurely. </p><p>Hermione’s eyes were wide. Were there people out there who were truly that interested in Hermione’s comings and goings? In her love life and clothing choices? Riddle had called her a socialite. Perhaps she wasn’t as self-aware as she should be. “I’m flattered. Um… do you think you could help me by answering a few questions?”</p><p>“Oh, certainly,” the witch simpered. </p><p>“I was told you had been recently in the company of a wizard by the name of Cyrus Pilloughby. He’s currently being held in Azkaban awaiting trial for a breach of the prison’s wards.”</p><p>The witch’s face grew sad and forlorn. “Yes, we had gone out a few times. I had no idea he was capable of something like that, though.”</p><p>“Did he ever say anything to you about Dominik Hausler, or the prison?”</p><p>Adria looked completely bumfuzzled. “It’s like I told the aurors, he never said a word about anything of the sort. I never would’ve suspected him of it.”</p><p>Hermione tilted her head. “But he did have certain political beliefs. Are you aware of his anti-muggle sentiments?”</p><p>She looked somewhat chagrined. “Well… yes, vaguely, but he never carried on about those things when we were together. We mostly talked about work and family. He was a family man, a good wizard, and a gentleman, as far as I knew. So you can imagine my shock when he was detained.”</p><p>“Yes, of course,” Hermione sympathized. “Did he happen to mention anything out of the ordinary? Did you ever overhear any strange conversations?”</p><p>“Well… no, not really.” The witch seemed to be considering. “Well, actually, there was one odd conversation that I recall. We were all standing in line, waiting to floo home after work. He was standing with one of his good work friends, Geoffrey. They were talking in hushed voices about some… how did he put it? An alliance of dark wizards? Something like that.”</p><p>Hermione’s interest was piqued. “An alliance of dark wizards?”</p><p>“<em> Oh… </em> ” The witch seemed distressed. “Now I can’t remember for the <em> life </em> of me what they were saying.”</p><p>“What is the name of his friend?”</p><p>“Geoffrey Woolrich. He works in the Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes. Obliviator Headquarters. Level three.”</p><p>“Thank you, Miss Prewett. This has been most helpful.”</p><p>Hermione once again extricated herself and made her way up the elevator with her press escort. She felt like she was on a scavenger hunt, but excitement cured in her veins. An alliance of dark wizards? What did that mean? Was she referring to the Death Eaters? Or was there another organization yet to be uncovered? Hermione felt the thrill of investigative journalism vibrating through her.</p><p>As she waited for the Department secretary to fetch the employee for her, she heard a voice call out. </p><p>“Oi! Dumbledore! Fancy seeing you here!”</p><p>Hermione whipped around to find Septimus Weasley grinning, an apple in hand, walking through the main office where the lobby was. </p><p>“Septimus! What a pleasant surprise!”</p><p>“Well you <em> are </em> in <em> my </em> neck of the woods, it appears.”</p><p>Hermione heaved a deep breath. “Forgive me, I completely forgot this was your department. I’ve interviewed so many people today, my head is spinning like I’ve been hit with the bloody Spinning hex!”</p><p>Septimus laughed. “Anything I can help you with?”</p><p>“I’m just trying to find out more about Cyrus Pilloughby.”</p><p>Septimus wrinkled his nose. “Unpleasant fellow. Not surprised he got himself chucked in Azkaban. A bit surprising <em> how </em> he wound up there, though.”</p><p>“You don’t believe him capable of it?”</p><p>He shook his head. “I don’t think anybody does. Not the smartest bloke.”</p><p>Hermione smiled tightly. “That seems to be the consensus. I don’t believe he did it. I believe someone is framing him for it.”</p><p>“You don’t say? I’ll wager if anyone can sniff out the truth, it’s Detective Dumbledore.”</p><p>Hermione grinned and rolled her eyes. “Right. There’s an entire department for that sort of thing and it’s all up to me. A twenty-year-old writer with a love of dresses and house elves.”</p><p>“You’re damned right,” Septimus said with a wink. “Go get ‘em, Mione!”</p><p>Hermione couldn’t help but chuckle as he walked away and her press escort approached with a young, sandy-haired wizard. </p><p>He looked at Hermione warily.</p><p>She held out her hand. “Hermione Dumbledore. I presume you’re Mr. Woolrich?”</p><p>He took her hand and shook it hesitantly. “I am.”</p><p>“May I have a word privately?”</p><p>He nodded curtly and followed her into an empty office.</p><p>“Have a seat, Mr. Woolrich.”</p><p>The wizard sat and stared at her.</p><p>She smiled beguilingly. “I just need to ask you a few questions about your friend, Cyrus Pilloughby.”</p><p>“I thought the press was instructed not to report on that messy business about the breach,” he said in a hard voice.</p><p>“It was <em> suggested </em> that The Prophet delay any reports until more information has been uncovered about the breach. However, I am doing my job as a journalist. Whether I release an article now or later, or never, remains to be seen. It is still my duty to follow every lead and unravel every potential thread of truth that presents itself. I’m told you and Cyrus were friends?”</p><p>“Work friends. More acquaintances, really.”</p><p>Hermione looked the young man in the eyes. He appeared only a few years older than Hermione. She decided that being candid was the best approach. “I will be perfectly honest, Mr. Woolrich. I don’t believe your friend is guilty of what he’s being accused of.”</p><p>He looked around uncomfortably. “Well… I don’t either.”</p><p>Hermione nodded. “I can see that you don’t trust reporters. But I’m not here to twist your words or get you to admit something you don’t want to. If you help me, I might be able to clear his name. Or at least cast a shadow of doubt in the mind of the public. </p><p>He seemed to soften slightly. “Look, I don’t really much care. If he did it, then he deserves what he gets. But what rubs me the wrong way is an innocent bloke getting tossed in that place. Azkaban prison is a hellhole and no mistake. A person comes out of there, they’re never the same. It don’t sit right with me.”</p><p>Hermione nodded enthusiastically. “And I agree. Can you tell me, was there anything he said to you before he was arrested? Anything he might have been mixed up in? Is there anyone who might wish ill toward him?”</p><p>His brows drew forward and he looked away as if considering. “Well… forgive me, but… he wasn’t really a fan of yours.”</p><p>“Of <em> me </em>?”</p><p>He nodded, a bit chagrined. “Yeah. Your articles had his knickers in a twist. He said a lot o’ things that weren’t very respectful. Ironic, isn’t it? You come ‘round wanting to help the sod?” He chuckled.</p><p>“I see. He held certain beliefs, which my articles obviously counteracted. Was he a member of any sort of organization? Connected with any powerful people that he may have angered?”</p><p>“Yeah,” he nodded. “Now that I think about it, I remember him wagging his tongue quite a bit ‘bout some alliance of purebloods. Been practicing the dark arts and whatnot. They’d tried to recruit him but he told ‘em to sod off basically. Didn’t like the guy leading the whole crew. Said he was bare booky, a nothing and a nobody.”</p><p>Hermione’s blood ran cold. Her heart beat faster. “Who was their leader?”</p><p>“I don’t know his name, but he kept bumping his gums about the bloke being a shopboy.”</p><p>Hermione’s lips parted. She held her breath. “What else did he say?”</p><p>“I reckon the bloke by the name Mulciber was a member. I don’t rightly remember the name… something about Knights. Yeah, the Knights.”</p><p>Hermione swallowed. “Knights of Walpurgis?”</p><p>“That’s it, yeah.”</p><p>Hermione nodded. “Did he talk about these people often?”</p><p>“For a bit, yeah. He was always jabbing on about them. Said they were delusional gits and they’d all end up in Azkaban.” He laughed dryly. “Funny how that turned out, innit?”</p><p>“Mmm,” Hermione hummed. </p><p>Very funny, indeed.</p><p><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
</p><p>Tom knocked back a glass of firewhiskey. </p><p>He’d already had two glasses of absinthe. He only turned to the green fairy when he was hoping to get drunk rather quickly.</p><p>He had a sinking feeling that Hermione wouldn’t show up tonight. </p><p>He lit a cigarette. </p><p>Tom couldn’t decide if he’d show up at her flat and drag her out by her hair or if he’d let her stew in her loneliness.</p><p>He didn’t know which would be worse.</p><p>Visions of Hermione plagued Tom. His witch, lying soft and bare on his sofa, sweet moans falling from her lips as she begged him to fuck her.</p><p>Tom squeezed his eyes shut tight and breathed out a cloud of smoke. </p><p>He could still taste her.</p><p>The cunt hadn’t responded to a single message he’d written to her.</p><p>He thought about astral projecting into her flat, but something stopped him. </p><p>Perhaps he’d transgressed enough for one week.</p><p>Tom was extremely curious about how she would react.</p><p>He had royally pissed her off, after all.</p><p>He didn’t even blame her, truthfully. He’d taken her virginity in a rather abrupt and cruel way, and then embarrassed and rejected her when she had submitted herself to him so sweetly.</p><p>On her <em> birthday </em>, no less.</p><p>He laughed caustically to himself. He certainly was a prick sometimes. That, he couldn’t deny.</p><p>But it didn’t matter.</p><p>She was <em> his </em>.</p><p>He’d claimed her.</p><p>She would just have to get over it.</p><p>She’d need to grow a thick skin anyway if she was going to run with Riddle.</p><p>His path was one rife with uncertainty and danger. </p><p>That was another thing that Tom had recently contemplated. Was Alphard Black right? Did Tom have anything to offer her besides himself? The road to power was treacherous and dark. He’d never imagined having a woman by his side.</p><p>Knowing Hermione, she wouldn’t approve of his cause or his methods. So how would it even work?</p><p>Based purely on their connection and attraction, sure. Tom felt that she was perfect for him. But did their goals align? That was a confusing aspect of the soulmate theory. How could they be a perfect match when their paths digressed so sharply?</p><p>Tom tossed back another glass of firewhiskey and shoved his cigarette between his lips, inhaling.</p><p>This witch was taking up too much space in his thoughts. He thought irritatedly of all the reading he needed to catch up on; he still had yet to punish Dolohov for his insolence. He would perform legilimency on his Death Eaters this week. He didn’t trust the lot of them. </p><p>Then, he had a meeting next week with Wilhelmina Tuft’s future cabinet and several other major magical players in the international scene. She wanted to introduce Tom to the various important names before he introduced himself to the public. </p><p>She’d told Tom he would have to quit his job as a shopboy and take a Ministry position.</p><p>He didn’t intend to do that. He still needed to find objects to make into horcruxes.</p><p>He didn’t know if he wanted to campaign. He didn’t know if he wanted to go into politics. That had never been part of his plan.</p><p>But then again, it would grant him immeasurable power. </p><p>He would carefully weigh his options until the answer jumped out at him.</p><p>He took another drag from his cigarette.</p><p>Once again, Hermione flitted through his mind like a film reel.</p><p>His morning wank had been centered around thoughts of her pleasuring herself. The thought of her touching herself while thinking of him was extremely arousing to Tom. </p><p>He thought absentmindedly that he would like to watch her.</p><p>As the daylight turned to dusk, and then to darkness, Tom switched on the green glass lamp and decided to get some reading done. </p><p>He had just pulled a book from his shelf and ran his fingers down the spine when he heard a knock at the door.</p><p>His eyes narrowed.</p><p>So the little witch decided to play, after all.</p><p>Tom crossed to the door and opened it.</p><p>There stood Hermione, wearing an elegant black wrap dress and glaring at him with one of the iciest looks he’d seen in a while.</p><p>He smirked and held the door wide. </p><p>She moved past him into the room.</p><p>She stood in the middle of his flat, and he came around to face her. Their eyes locked. </p><p>Tom couldn’t read the expression on her face.</p><p>Then, she did something he did not expect.</p><p>Hermione suddenly launched herself at him, wrapping her arms around his neck and pressing her lips to his.</p><p>Tom stood frozen in surprise for a moment before he wrapped his arms around her and pulled her tightly against him. </p><p>She parted her lips and Tom sucked in a breath sharply through his nose as he slipped his tongue in her mouth.</p><p>She tangled her fingers in the hair at the base of his neck and then pushed him back with her body weight until he fell into the armchair behind him. </p><p>Hermione climbed into his lap to straddle him. His eyebrows rose. This was clearly not the reaction he’d anticipated.</p><p>Hermione continued to kiss him, as she ground her hips against his. His arms snaked up her back to thread his hands in her hair.</p><p>She moaned softly, and she felt his hardness against her thigh.</p><p>Tom broke the kiss and muttered, “Fuck.”</p><p>Then, Hermione leaned back and muttered, “<em> Petrificus Totalus. </em>”</p><p>Tom froze.</p><p>Hermione pulled her wand from her pocket, still aimed at him. She tossed his hands off of her and reached around to take his wand from his pocket. “I’ll be taking this now.”</p><p>Hermione climbed off his lap and stood back, gazing at him with a cheeky smirk. “So you like to play games, Tom?” She leaned forward and rubbed his cheek before smacking it gently. “Well, tonight we’re going to play <em> my </em> game.”</p><p>His eyes narrowed, following her as she began to untie the belt of her black wrap dress. She shrugged it off her shoulders and let it fall to her feet, revealing her lacy black lingerie. She wore a see-through balconette bra, delicate lace knickers, and a belt that hooked to saucy little garters on her thighs that held up her lace-trimmed black stockings. </p><p>Tom’s eyebrows rose.</p><p> </p><hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Tonight, Hermione felt very confident. Everything he’d done yesterday was to unnerve her, to make her feel bare and vulnerable, weak and submissive. But Hermione wouldn’t give him the last laugh. He didn’t deserve the satisfaction. </p><p>“I do believe you’re speechless, Tom,” she said with a smile. She waved her wand, releasing his mouth from the Full Body Bind.</p><p>He pressed his tongue against his cheek. “What do you think you’re doing, little witch?”</p><p>She shrugged. “Oh, I don’t know, Tom. I thought you might enjoy a show. See, I intend to show you exactly what I did last night when you sent me home high and dry.”</p><p>At that, she slid the lace knickers down her hips and let them fall to the floor. She stepped out of them and walked to the sofa and lay down. Then, she spread her legs. </p><p>Tom’s eyes narrowed and followed her like a hawk’s. “You must <em> love </em> to play with fire, Hermione.”</p><p>She smiled and gave a throaty laugh as her fingers wandered between her legs. “Oh, I think you’re the one playing with fire, Tom.”</p><p>His eyes flared and the corners of his lips turned up. His gaze fell to where her fingers had begun to circle her clit.</p><p>His jaw tensed.</p><p>Hermione’s other hand wandered to her breast and squeezed, pinching her nipple between her fingers and rolling it gently. She let out a soft moan.</p><p>Tom’s nostrils flared.</p><p>Her eyes met his and she smiled. His eyes shot daggers at her, but he didn’t speak as he watched her.</p><p>She slipped two fingers inside herself.</p><p>Tom’s lips parted.</p><p>She pumped them in and out of herself, and they could both hear the sound of her wetness in the quiet room.</p><p>He sucked in a sharp breath.</p><p>“Mmm,” she moaned, closing her eyes and letting her head fall back. “Alphard.”</p><p>His mouth fell open and his eyes narrowed. </p><p>“Oh, hell no,” he muttered. </p><p>She went back to rubbing her clit in quick movements. “Abraxas,” she moaned. </p><p>Tom suddenly started laughing. The sound of it was dangerous and carried the promise of retribution. “You’re in so much trouble, little witch.”</p><p>Hermione reached between her legs with her other hand and began to finger herself as she massaged her clit. </p><p>Tom’s eyes were dark with anger but he never stopped watching her. He couldn’t. He was too enthralled by her little display. </p><p>What a tantrum his witch could throw. </p><p>He found it positively glorious, seeing her bite back with her little teeth. </p><p>He’d get revenge for it, of course. But it was too thrilling not to enjoy every moment of it.</p><p>He watched as her body began to tense up. Her moans came more regularly and her breathing became jagged. She started to buck her hips and Tom realized that he was painfully hard.</p><p>Whatever she’d intended by this, it was obviously working. </p><p>Suddenly, she arched back, her chest flushing red. Her mouth dropped open and her head fell back. </p><p>“Oh, fuck,” she moaned as she came. He could tell by the way her movements slowed and her pussy became red and swollen. </p><p>He wanted to taste her.</p><p>He needed to <em> ruin </em> her.</p><p><em> Come over here, little witch</em>, he thought. </p><p>He cast his magic outward, willing her to come to him.</p><p>She breathed heavily as she came down from the orgasm and her eyes met his. He stared back at her, his eyes narrowed resentfully. She smiled sweetly and then stood, walking over to him.</p><p>Her eyes fell to the prominent bulge in his trousers.</p><p>She gave a little pout. “Well, now that you’re good and… <em> warmed up</em>, Tom, perhaps you need a little taste of your own medicine.”</p><p>Tom grinned at her menacingly.</p><p>She climbed into his lap and straddled him boldly. Their eyes locked. </p><p>Hermione unbuckled his belt and then unzipped his pants. She reached past the waistband of his boxers and gripped his cock, pulling him free.</p><p>He decided he enjoyed this bold version of Hermione. He couldn’t decide which he liked better, her fiery side or her submissive side. </p><p>Every facet of the witch fascinated him.</p><p>Hermione leaned in and pressed her lips gently to his. Then she whispered, “Perhaps I should give you just a little taste… and then <em> leave </em> you.”</p><p>He smirked and his eyes fell to where she held him in her hand. She pumped him a few times, then she hovered over him, lining him up with her center. The head of his cock pressed against her warmth, and he flicked his eyes back to her face to see her bite her lip.</p><p>She impaled herself on his cock slowly, torturously.</p><p>“Fuck,” Tom murmured. “<em>Enough</em>.”</p><p>Suddenly, he broke free of the Full Body Bind spell and wrapped his arms around her, pinning her against him in an unbreakable hold. </p><p>She gasped. The lusty glaze of her eyes shifted quickly to fear and alarm.</p><p>Tom chuckled. “Do you really think I can’t break a simple Body Bind curse without my wand?” He shook his head. “You severely underestimate me. I confess I’m disappointed.”</p><p>Hermione’s chest heaved. “Let me go, Tom.”</p><p>“I’ll say this once, Hermione. Don’t ever try to curse me again.”</p><p>Her eyes snapped with anger. “I think you had that one coming <em> many </em> times over.”</p><p>He smirked, then nodded. “Perhaps. Are we even now, little witch?”</p><p>Hermione swallowed. “Maybe.”</p><p>“Did you think you were punishing me? On the contrary, you just made my most recent fantasy come true. I only wish I could’ve had a wank while I watched you, but that’s quite alright. I’ll think about it later.”</p><p>She scowled. “You’re a fucking prick, Riddle.”</p><p>He cocked an eyebrow. “I don’t disagree with you.”</p><p>Her breathing was heavy, and she realized he was still inside her. “If you could’ve stopped me, why didn’t you?”</p><p>Tom grinned. “I wanted to see what my little witch had planned, of course. You certainly didn’t disappoint. I have to say, of all the ways I thought you’d react, I never anticipated this. Although I am feeling a bit vindictive about you moaning other wizards’ names. See, I’m quite possessive and territorial. I might just have to maim them irreversibly.”</p><p>She jerked against his hold. “You wouldn’t.”</p><p>His eyes pierced hers and his voice was hard. “I <em> would </em>.”</p><p>She shook her head. “It wasn’t their fault. It was mine.”</p><p>He lowered his head until they were face to face. “Then take care which games you decide to play.”</p><p>She lifted her chin a notch. “Don’t play games with <em> me </em>, then, Tom.”</p><p>His eyes roamed her face. “Is that what you think I’m doing?”</p><p>She writhed against his hold, trying to break free. “I <em> know </em> that’s what you’re doing.”</p><p>He grinned as she struggled against his arms angrily. “Stop it now. The more you struggle the more I want to ruin you.” His eyes flicked down over her flushed body. “For a witch who was only recently a virgin, you’re quite a sensual little thing, aren’t you?” He smiled as she scowled. “That’s alright, darling. So am I. I’ll be able to keep your voracious appetite satisfied.”</p><p>“Oh, <em> fuck </em> you!” she exclaimed. “Let. Me. <em> Go </em>!” </p><p>“Never,” he murmured in her ear. </p><p>His hand threaded in her hair and gripped her curls tightly, yanking her head back as his lips found her throat. “I’ll never let you go, little witch. You’re trapped.” His teeth grazed her jugular vein.</p><p>Then, as he held her tightly against him, he began to thrust upward and into her. </p><p>Her mouth fell open. “<em> Oh </em>,” she breathed.</p><p>He thrust harder. “Fuck,” she gasped.</p><p>He released her from his hold and moved to take her hips in his hands, holding her suspended in the air. “Hold on,” he whispered.</p><p>She shook her head. “Wait...”</p><p>“Enough, Hermione. You’ve made your point. Now, let me have you.”</p><p>He began to drill into her, thrusting rapidly and creating friction so exquisite that Hermione leaned forward and buried her head into his shoulder. </p><p>“Tom,” she moaned against his shirt.</p><p>He paused and reached to grip her hair, yanking her head back. “Eyes on me.”</p><p>Their eyes met and something seemed to shift between them. </p><p>“You’re mine,” he muttered.</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>Tom shifted her against him and reached around, grabbing her backside. He began to grind her against him as he deepened his thrusts.</p><p>“Tom,” she whispered.</p><p>His eyes met hers.</p><p>“Are you mine?” she asked.</p><p>His eyes searched her face.</p><p>“You want me to be yours?” he asked with a slight smirk.</p><p>She nodded soberly.</p><p>He pulled her forward until his breath fell against her lips. “I’m yours for the taking, little witch.”</p><p>She leaned in and kissed him.</p><p>Their lips stayed locked as he impaled her, seating himself fully inside her, stroking the sweet spot inside her that she’d never known existed until now.</p><p>He felt it when her walls began to tighten around him, milking his cock. </p><p>She moaned against his lips as she came again, her warmth contracting around him.</p><p>Then he broke the kiss.</p><p>“Fuck, Hermione,” he breathed as he pulsed within her, filling her with his seed.</p><p>It was a quick, but effective joining.</p><p>They both breathed heavily in the aftermath.</p><p>He swallowed, his Adam’s apple bobbing as he pulled out of her, watching with no small amount of pleasure as his cum dripped out of her.</p><p>He decided there was no more beautiful sight. </p><p>He held his hand out in a wandless <em> accio </em>, summoning his wand from the sofa where she’d dropped it.</p><p>He begrudgingly cast a contraception charm.</p><p>Then his eyes met hers.</p><p>“Stay,” he murmured.</p><p>“Stay here?” she whispered. “Tonight?”</p><p>“Every night,” he breathed. </p><p>She didn’t answer him. She merely fell against him in exhaustion.</p><p>He wrapped his arms around her. </p><p>Hermione felt happy. </p><p>She didn’t attempt to understand how the one person who had stolen her happiness in one lifetime could bestow it in another.</p><p>She merely let herself feel it.</p>

<br/>
</p><p>Hermione felt awkward staying at Tom Riddle’s flat for the first time. She would need to remind herself to pack a toothbrush from now on in her beaded bag. It was a habit of growing up as a child with dentists for parents. She couldn’t just <em> not </em> brush her teeth before bed. It just felt fundamentally wrong.</p><p>Tom offered her his shirt to sleep in and she took a minute for herself in the bathroom. Mainly to scourgify his dried cum off her thigh and remind herself to breathe. Everything in his flat was so… <em> normal </em>. He had a normal toothbrush and toothpaste and a bed and a dresser and a mirror  attached to the back of his bathroom door. His towel hung on a hook in the bathroom. Hermione swallowed. She had not prepared herself for the normality of being in Lord Voldemort’s bathroom. It was just too weird to be this normal.</p><p>Hermione used the toilet because she knew it was good to do that after sex and then she looked at herself in the mirror. Her hair was in slight disarray, falling in wild ringlets down her back. She took off the stockings and garters and put them in her beaded bag. Then she unhooked her bra and laid it aside. She slipped her arms in the sleeves of his shirt and buttoned it up. It was perfectly white and pressed to perfection. It smelled like him. Everything in this flat did. A mixture of whiskey and smoke, cedar, oud wood, and amber. </p><p>She hadn’t intended this to happen tonight, but here it was. She was going to stay with Riddle. He’d asked her to. Not only that, but he wanted her here <em> every </em> night, he’d said. She couldn’t imagine he’d actually meant that.</p><p>The first time they’d slept in the same bed, it had been somewhat of an accident. They’d come together in a violent, feverish tangle of limbs and passed out almost immediately after. This time, she was thinking about it. She was <em> choosing </em> this.</p><p>For a moment, she nearly hyperventilated. It was all just too <em> intimate </em>.</p><p><em> Get a grip, </em> she told herself. <em> You’ve had his penis in you. There’s nothing more intimate than that. </em></p><p>She placed a hand on the bathroom door and opened it slowly. </p><p>Tom was currently standing with his back to her. He wore nothing but his boxers, and his back muscles rippled in the dim lamp light. His closet door was open, and he appeared to be selecting his work clothing for the next day. He seemed to be very much a creature of habit, Hermione mused. Everything in his flat seemed to be pristine. Spotless. Everything perfectly placed in some odd semblance of order that only Riddle understood. He laid his clothes and robes out on a chair. The way he placed his trousers, neatly folded, onto the chair, then his belt on the left side over the back of the chair, then his tie on the right side, his socks folded once and in the center, then his shirt draped over those, then slid his shoes under the chair… It was as if he had done it a million times before and could do it in his sleep. </p><p>Hermione’s brow furrowed. Her curiosity won out over her nervousness. “Do you do that every night?”</p><p>He turned, having obviously not heard her come out of the bathroom. He looked to the chair where she gestured. “What?”</p><p>“Do you… always lay them out like that? In that exact pattern?”</p><p>He looked at the chair with his clothes laid out as if he were seeing it for the first time. “Ah… I suppose I do. I never noticed.”</p><p>The corners of Hermione’s lips turned up and she bit back a smile. His eyes narrowed as he took in her expression. “Are you finding something funny?”</p><p>“No,” she choked out, trying not to laugh. “It’s just… you seem a bit OCD.”</p><p>His brow drew forward sharply. “I seem a bit <em> what </em>?”</p><p>“OCD?” she murmured, surprised when he acted as if he had no idea what she was talking about. “Obsessive compulsive disorder. It’s sort of a… behavioral disorder of sorts.”</p><p>His mouth fell open slightly and he cocked his jaw to the side. He looked at the chair and then at Hermione. “Are you trying to say I’m fucked in the head, Dumbledore?”</p><p>She laughed. “Oh, there’s no question about <em> that </em> , <em> sir </em>.”</p><p>Tom cocked his head to the side and looked at her in complete disbelief. </p><p>She breezed past him and then turned and gave him a cheeky smile. “Now which side is yours?” She pointed to the bed.</p><p>Tom took a deep breath and shook his head. “This is going to be a lot of work.”</p><p>Her brows furrowed. “What is?”</p><p>He cleared his throat as he turned down the covers of his obsessively, <em> perfectly </em> made bed. “Fucking that attitude out of you.”</p><p>Hermione’s eyes widened and her mouth fell open. He grinned as she sputtered. “Pointing out the obvious does not mean I have an <em> attitude </em> , thank you very much! Look at your <em> sheets </em> , Tom. You make your bed <em> military </em> style, for Merlin’s sake!”</p><p>He looked down where she pointed, at the particular way that he twice folded his top sheet over the mattress in a very crisp and pristine manner. His eyebrows rose and he flicked his eyes back to her. “That’s how I had to do it at the orphanage… or I’d get punished.”</p><p>Hermione’s expression sobered instantly. “I… I didn’t know that. I’m sorry. I was just teasing you.”</p><p>He shrugged. “Don’t look so grim. I’m not bothered.”</p><p>Hermione cleared her throat. She remembered she had to pretend she didn’t know about the orphanage. “I wasn’t aware that you grew up in an orphanage, Tom.”</p><p>He looked at her and gave a slight smirk. “We didn’t have much time to discuss it with you avoiding me for months on end.”</p><p>“To be fair, you were trying to tell me what to do.”</p><p>“Ah, yes. The howlers and poisonous serpent letters.”</p><p>“Which is still <em> none </em> of your concern.”</p><p>He turned to her abruptly and slipped his arms around her waist. “As I’ve said before… everything to do with you is my concern.”</p><p>Hermione grew very quiet as she focused on the sensation of his touch. It was a different experience when they weren’t in a lust-filled frenzy.</p><p>His hand wandered beneath his shirt, his fingertips stroking her lower back softly. “You look quite sexy in my shirt, Hermione.”</p><p>His eyes were coal black and glinting in the dim light as they roamed her face. Hermione let her gaze drop to his mouth. Then she swallowed. He was just <em> too </em> devastatingly handsome, like a sharp blade that could cut Hermione’s heart to pieces.</p><p>He leaned down and kissed her. She felt his hands come up to the sides of her cheeks, his long fingers threading into the curls that framed her face. His lips gently coaxed and searched her own. His tongue slid over her bottom lip and his teeth tugged at it. Then he tilted his head and deepened the kiss, his mouth hungrily devouring hers. She let her tongue slip inside his mouth to play with his. She couldn’t believe how much pure pleasure she derived from just <em> kissing </em> him. She let out a contented sigh. </p><p>He chuckled under his breath and broke the kiss. Then, he took her chin between his thumb and forefinger and muttered, “It’s the right side.”</p><p>She realized he was referring to his side of the bed. “Perfect,” she whispered. “I’m on the left.”</p><p>He smirked. “Of course you are. We seem to always be on opposite sides, don’t we?”</p><p>At that, he turned and went in the bathroom, presumably to brush his teeth. Hermione took that opportunity to slip into bed. His bed was surprisingly comfortable, considering that it didn’t <em> look </em> very appealing in its military-like trappings. It was simple and clean, like the rest of his flat. Pristine white sheets, simple coverlet, only two pillows. Exactly as she’d imagined it. However, Hermione loved lots of pillows, so she would have to remedy that as soon as possible if she were going to stay here often. Still, it was rather cozy to her surprise and it had one distinct advantage over her own bed. It <em> smelled </em> like Tom.</p><p>Hermione buried her face in the pillow and inhaled. She simply could not figure out what it was about his scent that made her so feral. She determined to figure out what cologne he wore so that she could secretly buy it and spritz it on her own pillows.</p><p>Tom came back out of the bathroom and reached to turn off the light. He stopped with his hand on the switch and looked down at her, as if memorizing the image of her in his bed. Then he switched off the light, and plunged them into darkness.</p><p>She felt him getting into bed beside her. Her heart beat wildly in her chest. Why was this affecting her so much more than the sex had?</p><p>It was silent for a stretch. She could hear the sound of him breathing.</p><p>“Tom?”</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>“Has Walburga ever slept in this bed? With you?”</p><p>Tom burst out laughing. The sound seemed extra loud in the quiet room.</p><p>“Hermione, Walburga has never even been in this room, much less slept in my bed.”</p><p>“Oh,” Hermione murmured softly. She couldn’t help immediately feeling more at ease.</p><p>He rolled over and pulled her against him. “You really shouldn’t concern yourself over her, little witch. I can’t stress enough that she means nothing to me. If it makes you feel any better, you’re the only witch who has ever slept in my bed or set foot in this room.”</p><p>It did make Hermione feel better. She ran her hands over his chest in the dark, feeling the smooth planes of his muscles under her fingertips. His skin was hot and warmed her chilled body. </p><p>She curled up against his warmth under the blanket. His arms came up and wrapped around her. Hermione laid her head on his chest.</p><p>She couldn’t stop her fingers from wandering. Sliding across his smooth muscle. Threading in the light hair on his chest. Dragging across the cords of his throat. </p><p>Suddenly, he gripped her wrist. “You keep touching me and I’m going to be forced to fuck you again. Then neither of us will get any sleep.”</p><p>She gave a breathy chuckle. “Goodnight, Tom.”</p><p>His breath was hot against her ear. “Goodnight, little witch.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Tom awoke with a woman in his arms.</p><p>He pressed his face against her frizzy hair, breathing in the scent of lavender and vanilla. His cock was hard against her backside, and he ran his hand down her body, savoring the smooth skin beneath his fingertips.</p><p>She gave a sleepy sigh. Tom lay staring at her for several minutes, memorizing the look of peaceful rest on her features, committing to memory the delicate arch of her brow and the pert slope of her nose, then the soft curve of her lips and her sharp jawline. He couldn’t believe he’d ever thought her an average beauty. Truthfully, she was rather exquisite.</p><p>Tom left her sleeping and stood, making his way out to the kitchen to brew coffee. He hadn’t given any thought to what she might like in the mornings, as he hadn’t even believed she would really show up, much less end up staying overnight. He’d seen her on multiple occasions drinking tea in the mornings, so he put a kettle on.</p><p>Tom cocked his jaw to the side. He’d never imagined himself in this particular setting. It had been more of an impulse when he’d asked her to stay, a snap decision borne of his nightly longings for her body against his.</p><p>He was certainly in unfamiliar territory, but it was a comforting thought that she, too, seemed out of her element.</p><p>When he’d poured a pot of tea and the coffee was finished brewing, he went back to his room to take a shower. Hermione was still sleeping peacefully, so he didn’t disturb her.</p><p>The previous night replayed over and over in his mind as the hot water relaxed his muscles. He wasn’t quite as tense as he’d been the past few months. He smirked as he thought of the effects that a good shag had on his disposition. He was always much less edgy and irritable when his balls were empty. He supposed there was no escaping his male genetic makeup, regardless of his mental fortitude or magical competency. </p><p><em> Nature is nature, I suppose </em>, he thought wryly. </p><p>Despite feeling much more sated than he’d been the previous weeks, he felt his cock hardening as he thought about her little display the night before.</p><p>“Fucking hell, Hermione,” he whispered. “You’re a right little siren, aren’t you?”</p><p>He gripped himself and began to tug slowly. He thought of her spread out on his sofa in the raciest set of lingerie he’d ever laid eyes on, the pink flesh between her legs swollen and glistening with her arousal… of her fingers sliding inside her tight cunt. </p><p>He thought of her nervous admission. “I… I thought about your hands. How your ring would feel… inside me.”</p><p>“Fuck,” he breathed, gritting his teeth. </p><p>He thought of the dance of her footwork as she dueled, of three spells bursting forth from her wand simultaneously. </p><p><em> Impressive little slut </em>, he thought as he pumped himself faster.</p><p>An overwhelming sense of ownership washed over Tom. His entire body tensed with the force of it. <em> Mine </em>, he thought violently.</p><p>He would rip the throat out of anyone who touched her.</p><p>Finally, he thought of her soft whisper as he thrust into her deeply. “Tom… Are you mine?”</p><p>His cum shot across the tile. </p><p>Tom swallowed and his head fell forward as he braced himself with a hand on the shower wall. He took a jagged breath.</p><p>What was this witch doing to him?</p><p>He finished showering, then stepped out onto the cold bathroom floor to towel off. When he walked back into his bedroom, she was no longer in his bed.</p><p>He threw on a pair of boxers and walked out to the kitchen.</p><p>Hermione stood there in his shirt, a cup of tea in hand, going through every single cupboard in his kitchen.</p><p>“How do you <em> live </em>, Tom?” she exclaimed.</p><p>His brow furrowed. “Excuse me?”</p><p>“You have practically nothing to eat in this flat. You have toast and jam and coffee. What in Merlin’s name are you eating every day?”</p><p>He cocked a brow at her. When she gave him an exasperated look, he shrugged. Then, her eyes fell to his chest and then downward, widening perceptibly. Her mouth fell open. </p><p>“Do you always just walk around your flat naked?”</p><p>His eyes flicked down to his bare chest. “Usually.”</p><p>She averted her gaze nervously. He smirked at her obvious unease. Tom walked up behind her as she opened one of his kitchen drawers to examine its contents and he pressed himself against her back. His arm encircled her waist as he leaned down to whisper in her ear, “You weren’t so shy last night when I was drilling your tight cunt.”</p><p>She gasped and spun out of his grasp. “You cannot talk to me like that, Tom! For Merlin’s <em> sake </em>!”</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>“Because it’s- it’s just… <em> inappropriate </em>!”</p><p>He looked at her as if she’d gone daft.</p><p>“I don’t think there’s anything appropriate about what you did last night, so I wouldn’t pretend to be so prudish if I were you, little witch.”</p><p>Her mouth fell open, utterly aghast. </p><p>“As for my cupboards, I would’ve been better prepared if you’d actually responded to my messages yesterday.”</p><p>She lifted her chin and looked back at him coolly. “You didn’t really deserve a response, now did you?”</p><p>Tom didn’t answer her. He just stood staring at her, his eyes dark as the abyss.</p><p>At length, he spoke. “I want you every night, Hermione. Here, in my bed.”</p><p>Hermione’s lips parted and her eyebrows shot up. “And if I refuse?”</p><p>His jaw tensed. “Why would you want to?”</p><p>Her eyes fell and she looked around her. “I just… I think I should have the option to say no.”</p><p>He blinked slowly. “You do. I’m simply making my wishes known.”</p><p>“Will you ever come to my flat?”</p><p>He inclined his head. “If you wish.”</p><p>She glanced about them. “I do like your flat, though.”</p><p>His brows drew forward and he cocked his head. “Why?”</p><p>She shrugged, lifting her cup of tea to her lips to take a sip. “It feels like you. It’s exactly how I would’ve imagined the place you’d live. Your bed… it smells like you.”</p><p>He smirked. “You’ve mentioned the way I smell several times now.” He moved closer to her and dragged his knuckle across her cheek. “Does my scent turn you on?”</p><p>She nodded shyly. “Mhmm.”</p><p>His smirk widened into a grin. He drew her closer, his arms tightening about her body as he pressed his face into her hair. “I’d like to mirror that sentiment, little witch.”</p><p>He ran his hand down her spine and followed the curve of her lower back, then dragged over her bum and squeezed roughly, eliciting a gasp from her throat. </p><p>She frowned at him. “Working on that treasure map already, are you?”</p><p>He threw his head back and laughed. “It’s not like you could stop me if I was.”</p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes. “I could stop you. I can cast three curses at once, remember?”</p><p>His pupils flared and he cocked an eyebrow. “So you can. Quite <em> impressive </em>, little witch. How did you learn to do that?”</p><p>“Dumbledore taught me.”</p><p>He nodded. “Of course. I suspected as much. But it takes quite a powerful witch or wizard to accomplish something like that.”</p><p>She blushed profusely, but then looked at him seriously. “Tom… I’m still going to fight you. I can’t support what you stand for.”</p><p>He stared at her for a moment, blinking. After a moment, he tilted her chin up and looked into her eyes. “I don’t expect you to change a thing, Hermione. I wouldn’t want you any other way. But… when you walk through my door, you’re mine. Night belongs to us. The rest… it will have to work itself out.”</p><p>Hermione nodded in silent agreement.</p>

<em> Good morning, little siren. </em>
</p><p>
<em> I’m afraid you will spend tonight alone, as I will be dealing with some business out of the country for the evening. I would have you stay with me this Saturday night, but as always, it is your choice. </em>
</p><p>

Tom sat across from Dominik Hausler. They were in a dark cave, deep in the heart of the giant’s labyrinth, within the cliffside on the outskirts of Tirana. A torch of green flame lit the room, casting an eerie glow on the wizards’ faces. </p><p>“And here you are, at last. The one they call Voldemort,” breathed Hausler, in his guttural dialect. His eyes flicked over Riddle. “Is this your true form? Your hood obscured your face when I took the vow.”</p><p>Tom tilted his head. “I was polyjuiced when we first met in Azkaban. This is my true form.”</p><p>Hausler cocked an eyebrow. “A rather pretty form for one in search of such hideous forms of magic.”</p><p>Tom smirked. “Well. You know what they say. Never judge a book by its cover.”</p><p>Hausler didn’t smile. He gazed at Tom soberly, the scar slashing downward over his face gave him a permanent frown on one side of his face. “I always give honor where honor is due. I have yet to thank you for getting me out of that hellhole.”</p><p>Tom looked at him blankly. “Your thanks is engraved into your arm.” His eyes flicked down at the dark mark marring Hausler’s pale, flaky skin.</p><p>The serpent almost seemed to move, sliding out of the skull’s hollow orifice.</p><p>They both gazed at the mark and then their eyes met. Hausler gave a gravelly chuckle. “So it is. Better than wasting away in a dank cell. I must say, I had my doubts that you could do it.”</p><p>“I never promise something that I cannot deliver.”</p><p>Hausler inclined his head. “I guess that makes you a right sight better than Gellert. He was a powerful wizard, but he wagged his tongue overmuch, promising the moon.”</p><p>“Which leads me to my question,” Tom replied. “How was Grindelwald so powerful?”</p><p>“The dark arts,” Hausler responded. “How else do you think?”</p><p>“Which dark magic, specifically?”</p><p>“I don’t know everything, Voldemort. Grindelwald always played his cards close to the chest, as it were.”</p><p>Tom’s jaw tensed. “You’ve had time to recover from your stint in Azkaban. You were an overseer of many of the magical experiments conducted at Nurmengard. You have to know more than you’re letting on. Shall I have a look inside your mind? I am the most powerful Legilimens you’ll ever meet. Queenie Goldstein has nothing on me.”</p><p>Hausler chuckled. “So you know bout ol’ Queenie, eh? Treacherous little bitch, that one.”</p><p>Tom said nothing. His eyes were hard.</p><p>Hausler cleared his throat. “I do know many things. I can teach you how to create Inferi. I do know many things about the Obscurus. But it’s a raw and dangerous and <em> unpredictable </em> form of magic. Still… many of the things Gellert did to gain power, he did on his lonesome. He didn’t want anyone to be able to replicate his powers. However, there is something I learned of. He never knew I found out about it.”</p><p>Tom grew very still. He fixed his cold gaze on Dominik. “Go on.”</p><p>“He once gave me a bundle of his old papers from his years at Durmstrang, said it would help me with my work, my research. I don’t think he’d gone through them well, because there were a few things I think he’d rather I wouldn’t have seen.”</p><p>“Like what?”</p><p>“Well, there were a few letters, from Albus Dumbledore. Old letters.”</p><p>Tom’s eyes narrowed. This is why he regularly subjected his Death Eaters to legilimency. No follower could ever be trusted implicitly. Of course, it was possible that Grindelwald had included those particular items on purpose. He was notorious for testing his followers’ loyalty. “What else?”</p><p>“There were some old scrolls in a trunk amongst his books. Had a lot of notes on black magic and arithmancy, ancient rune translations… things like that. But there was a collection of ancient biographies, and some notes he’d made about a ritual he’d done several times. I believe it’s one of the reasons he was so powerful.”</p><p>Tom’s jaw muscles rippled. “Do take your time in telling me, won’t you?”</p><p>Hausler grinned and then leaned forward. “Are you aware that dark magic leaves traces?”</p><p>“I am.”</p><p>Hausler’s eyes glinted with an unstable fire. Tom knew he was mad. Years of time with Grindelwald, of the practice of dark magic, and of being subjected to the dementors of Azkaban had taken its toll. “When a dark wizard dies, his soul passes out of this material world, but the power contained in his body… the dark energy housed in his flesh is bound to this earthly realm. It cannot escape. It has to go somewhere. Some of it passes back into the earth. But much of it becomes encased in the corpse… it permeates the very carcass of the wizard. All that magic, steeped into the bones of a cadaver and buried in a tomb. Grindelwald had discovered an obscure bit of dark magic, an incantation which could extract that power from the bones of a dead body and transfer it to a living host. He spent years seeking out the graves of bygone dark wizards and absorbing the remnants and traces of their magic. He called it… the Feast of Bones.”</p><p>Tom was very still. His pupils blew wide; his pulse raced. Nausea turned in his gut; lust coiled in the pit of his stomach.</p><p>He needed to learn this piece of magic so intensely that he felt he might claw his own eyeballs out.</p><p>“Do you remember the incantation?”</p><p>Hausler shook his head. “It was a complex ritual. Only Grindelwald himself knew the extent of how it could be harnessed. I don’t know his methods. No one does.”</p><p>Tom gritted his teeth. “Where exactly is Grindelwald being kept?”</p><p>“He’s being kept at Nurmengard. In the highest tower, in the most strongly warded cell in the prison.”</p><p>Tom took a deep breath. He knew what he had to do. His eyes shifted to red and he looked back at Hausler.</p><p>Dominik’s face had gone pale. </p><p>“I’ll be back next month.” Tom stood to leave. </p><p>“Voldemort…”</p><p>Tom turned back to the older wizard. </p><p>“Do you intend to continue with Grindelwald’s plan? Is it his vision you seek to accomplish?”</p><p>Tom smiled, his red eyes gleaming in the eerie green light of the torches. “There are many who think they know what my plan is. But I don’t think there’s a soul alive who knows my true vision. I intend to keep it that way.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Gellert Grindelwald sat cross-legged on his bed in the corner of his dark cell at the top of the highest tower in Nurmengard prison. His eyes were closed, hands resting on his knees. He was meditating; an ancient mental practice that an older wizard had taught him years ago during his boyhood. Of all the magic he’d learned throughout the years, he never expected that this particular bit of knowledge would be the one thing keeping his mental sanity intact. The wards on his cell were the strongest in the world. He’d made sure of it. How ironic that his own fortress, a prison constructed to house his enemies, would now keep him contained.</p><p><em> I cannot get out </em>, he thought. He could hardly accept it. </p><p>He had always been able to find some method of escape.</p><p>But now he was trapped by his own brilliancy, imprisoned by his own arrogance.</p><p>
<em> I cannot get out. </em>
</p><p>Gellert closed his eyes. He brought to remembrance his childhood, submerging himself in a sea of memories.</p><p>Suddenly, he felt a presence in the room. The air grew colder.</p><p>He opened his eyes. He saw nothing. Was his mind now playing tricks on him, after all these countless months? It had been three years.</p><p>Was he destined for madness?</p><p>He closed his eyes. He let his soul begin to shift into the realm of the spirit. Then he could see with the eyes of his soul, using his aureatic eyesight.</p><p>He sensed a dark energy. It drifted in the corner of his cell, in the shadows where no light touched.</p><p>Gellert cast the tendrils of his magic toward the presence.</p><p>He wondered if it was perhaps a ghost. Some muggle he’d murdered? Come to haunt him?</p><p>He opened his eyes, shifting out of the spirit realm. “Who are you?”</p><p>He stared right at the shadows of the corner. </p><p>“Show yourself.”</p><p>Suddenly, a being began to take form. It was not human. A shadowy figure materialized before him. He could not detect what form the entity was taking. Its shadows shifted in and out of corporealness. He only made out its glowing red eyes watching him from the center of the dark vapor.</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>He was suddenly thrown back against the wall. His head cracked against the unyielding stone. There were icy fingers wrapped around his throat, and he found himself staring into the being’s blood-red eyes. </p><p>It spoke, and its utterance was like a turbulent wave of voices, like the river Styx which flowed with the dead in the heart of the Underworld. “Hello, Gellert.”</p><p>It sent a shiver down Grindelwald’s spine. He’d not felt darkness like this in many years. This surprised him, for he’d spent most of his life living in shadow. </p><p>Gellert drew a laborious breath; the pressure of the demon’s fingers around his throat threatened his consciousness. “I said, who are you?” he gritted out. “<em> What </em> are you?”</p><p>The deep chorus of voices laughed. “I’m a wizard who’s much, much smarter than you.”</p><p>The eyes burned into his own like the flames of hades. The hair on the back of his neck stood on end; his skin crawled with the force of the dark energy permeating the cell. “What do you want?” he muttered hoarsely.</p><p>“Legilimens.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p align="center">

</p><p><br/>
On Saturday morning, Tom sat at the head of a long table, in the meeting room on the top floor of The Leaky Cauldron. His Death Eaters were just arriving. Tom wore a dramatic ensemble; his suit and robes were entirely black. In one hand, he held a cup of coffee. In his other, he held his sinister looking wand of white yew wood. The carving on the handle looked much like a bird of death, its beak hooked and sharp. Tom looked paler than normal, when contrasted with the blackness of his suit. His eyes glowed red, and he did not bother to hide it today.</p><p>His Death Eaters were typically a rather jovial group on Saturday mornings, but an air of fear and dread permeated the atmosphere, and they sat in silence as each one arrived.</p><p>Only Dolohov bothered to speak. As he walked up to his designated seat, two chairs down from Tom, he tossed a paper down on the table. </p><p>“What are you going to do about this?”</p><p>Tom glanced down at the copy of The Daily Prophet. It was today’s paper. The headline read, “Azkaban Breach Linked to Dark Wizard Gang!”</p><p>It was Hermione’s article.</p><p>His jaw tensed. How the blazes did she even know about it? And how had she come to this bloody conclusion? </p><p>He flicked his eyes up to Dolohov, who was standing above Tom, carefully gauging his reaction. Tom stared back at him blankly. </p><p>“Did you break Dominic Hausler out of Azkaban?” asked Dolohov.</p><p>Tom took a sip of coffee. “That’s on a need to know basis.” He flicked his wand and Dolohov was forcefully shoved into his seat. “Meaning you don’t need to know.”</p><p>Dolohov took in Tom’s appearance, then met his glowing red gaze. His defiant expression faltered somewhat. “What are you going to do about the Dumble-bitch?”</p><p>Tom’s jaw tensed. It took everything within Tom not to rip Dolohov’s heart out there in front of the entire room. “You let me worry about her. Understood?”</p><p>Dolohov shrugged. </p><p>Tom blinked. Then, he took a sip of coffee. Then, with a flick of his wand, Dolohov suddenly began grasping at his throat. </p><p>The eyes of the entire room were on him. </p><p>Nobody said a word.</p><p>The tall, dark-haired Death Eater made a strangled noise from the back of his throat, attempting to suck in air, but there was none to be had. He gasped and banged on the table, turning his wide-eyed gaze on Tom.</p><p>Tom merely sniffed, then reached into the pocket of his robes and withdrew his cigarette case. He pulled one out and set it between his lips, lighting it with a match.</p><p>He inhaled as he watched the man choke on nothing. His face turned a brilliant shade of red. He banged on the table again, then looked to Tom. </p><p>Tom stared back at him coldly, his red eyes glowing.</p><p>Abraxas looked at Tom, then lifted a hand as if he might say something, but dropped it back into his lap.</p><p>Tom ejected a puff of smoke into Dolohov’s face as the man gripped at his throat, his skin now blooming into a magenta color, the veins in his neck and forehead popping out grotesquely.</p><p>Avery lifted his hand to his throat with a grimace, clearly disturbed by the scene.</p><p>Tom smirked as his follower stumbled out of his seat and fell onto the floor, asphixiating. His eyes were bulging as he attempted to crawl to Tom, but he succumbed to the strangulation before he reached Tom’s shoes. His face was nearly blue when he lost consciousness; only then, did Tom release him.</p><p>Tom waved his wand, rennervating him. The relief was palpable in the room as Dolohov began dragging in a breath, coughing intermittently. After a moment, his lungs were full and he began  heaving deep breaths.</p><p>“Crucio,” Tom murmured. </p><p>Dolohov’s eyes, which had been at half-mast, suddenly snapped open, his pupils dilated to saucers as he arched back, his posture distorted and unnatural. A guttural scream ripped from his chest, several octaves higher than his normal timbre. His fingernails dug into the wood floor and the sound of them dragging could be heard, causing several other faces in the room to wince uncomfortably.</p><p>He screamed and screamed. </p><p>He passed out after a minute, then Tom rennervated him.</p><p>Tom tortured him for another two minutes after he came to.</p><p>Very few could handle the torture curse for that long.</p><p>Mulciber shivered involuntarily.</p><p>When Tom put his cigarette out in a little ashtray, he finally released the man.</p><p>Dolohov had passed out again.</p><p>Tom pointed his wand at the man as he lay unconscious on the floor. “Rennervate.”</p><p>The man’s eyelids fluttered open, though they had been rolled back into his head.</p><p>Tom stared at him blankly for a moment, then muttered, “Legilimens.”</p><p>The Death Eaters sat in stony silence for several minutes as Tom rifled through Dolohov’s mind. They didn’t dare to even look at one another.</p><p>The minutes stretched on painfully. Fear hung in the atmosphere like a corpse from a noose.</p><p>After a moment, Tom stood back and lowered his wand. Dolohov lay on his side, curled up in a fetal position, groaning in pain, barely conscious.</p><p>Tom looked at the faces around the table. No one met his eye.</p><p>Then he walked to the front of the table and sat down. He picked up the copy of The Daily Prophet from the table and stuffed it into his robes. </p><p>“What news from the Ministry, Mulciber?” Tom glanced at him while lifting his cup of coffee to his lips.</p><p>Mulciber swallowed, then cleared his throat and slowly began to give his account.</p><p>He droned on for several minutes, then remarked, “Oh, and Hermione Dumbledore was there this past week with her press escort, asking lots of questions about the Azkaban breach.”</p><p>Tom blinked. “Go on.”</p><p>“She interviewed Gaspard Dufresne, then several co-workers of Cyrus Pilloughby in the Department of Magical Transportation.”</p><p>Tom pressed his tongue to his cheek, then took a deep breath. </p><p>His witch was smart. Too smart for her own good.</p><p>Tom stood abruptly. “That’s all for today. You may go.” He glanced down at Dolohov. He toed his ribs, rolling him over onto his back, eliciting a groan. “Someone deal with this piece of shit.”</p><p>At that, Tom made his way down the stairs and walked out of the back entrance, toward Knockturn Alley.</p><p> </p><p><br/>

<em> Has an innocent wizard been imprisoned unjustly? This article shines a light on the Ministry of Magic’s flawed criminal justice system, in hopes that perhaps, the investigation into the Azkaban breach might be revisited prior to the trial of Cyrus Pilloughby before the Wizengamot in November. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Has Azkaban been breached? No other news source can keep you better informed than The Daily Prophet. We vow to give you the information that you, our readers, deserve as citizens of Magical Britain. I, Hermione Dumbledore, will share illuminating insight from an exclusive interview with Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, Gaspard Dufresne.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> According to Dufresne, aurors were alerted in early April when news broke to the DMLE that a high-profile prisoner escaped from his cell in Azkaban prison. I have not been given clearance by the Ministry to release the prisoner’s name at the present time.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> There were no explosions nor magical breaches of the prison walls, and all wards and enchantments remain intact.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> So how does a prisoner disappear into thin air from an unbreachable prison? </em>
</p><p>
<em> Enter one Cyrus Pilloughby, an employee of the Ministry of Magic, Department of Magical Transportation, Portkey Offices.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> According to Dufresne, this worker had recently visited the escaped prisoner only weeks before the disappearance. His name is listed in the prison’s visitor logbooks and his wand was presented as identification to the Wand Weigher. </em>
</p><p>
<em> The DMLE performed priori incantato on his wand, revealing a shocking list of spells that lead aurors to believe he is somehow responsible for the breach.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Sounds quite suspicious, doesn’t it?  </em>
</p><p>
<em> It sounds too suspicious. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Aurors still do not know how the escape could have been executed. Not only that but when aurors performed legilimency on Pilloughby, memories of his visit to the prison were bizarrely absent. </em>
</p><p>
<em> With a little sleuth work on my part, I discovered that not a single one of Pilloughby’s co-workers thought him motivated to do such a thing, nor did they think him magically capable of such a feat.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> The DMLE believes that Pilloughby received help from other dark wizards to accomplish such an escape.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> What do I think? I think he was framed. </em>
</p><p>
<em> The potential for such atrocious plots is endless, from a possible polyjuice charade to the use of the imperius curse and obliviation. We must not rule out these possibilities when investigating crimes of this magnitude. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Enter one Geoffrey Woolrich, an employee of the Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes, Obliviator Headquarters. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Mr. Woolrich has been a work friend of Mr. Pilloughby for some time now. He gave me a rather interesting piece of information about Mr. Pilloughby. In the weeks leading up to the escape, Mr. Pilloughby was approached by what Woolrich referred to as “an alliance of purebloods.” This dark wizard gang attempted to recruit Pilloughby to their organization, whose activities center around dark magic and nefariously anti-muggle leanings. Pilloughby refused, and, according to Woolrich, was quite vocal about the gang’s activities and their leader.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> “(The gang) had been practicing the dark arts and whatnot,” says Woolrich. “They’d tried to recruit him but he told ‘em to sod off basically. Didn’t like the guy leading the whole crew. Said he was bare booky, a nothing and a nobody. Said they were delusional gits and they’d all end up in Azkaban. Funny how that turned out, innit?” </em>
</p><p>
<em> Perhaps not quite funny, but ironic, indeed. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Was Mr. Pilloughby framed by this organization? Is there a dark wizard at large with the capability to perform impossible feats of magic? </em>
</p><p>
<em> Does an innocent man deserve to be held in such a terrible place while awaiting trial? Very few who emerge from the prison return to society the same. The rate of witches and wizards going mad in the prison are alarming.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> This is partly due to the dark magic housed inside its walls, the prison’s terrifying and untrustworthy guards (Dementors), and the inhumane conditions in which the prisoners are kept. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Azkaban prison’s walls have never been breached to date. There isn’t a prisoner that has escaped since the prison’s inception in the 17th century. Most of its prisoners have died of despair, having lost the will to live, and are buried on the island. </em>
</p><p>
<em> This breach must naturally lead us to question the efficacy of Azkaban as a magical prison for British criminals.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Many in the wizarding world are not aware of the dark history behind Azkaban.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Azkaban was built in the 15th century, both unplottable and hidden from the muggle world with certain concealment charms. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Azkaban belonged to a dark wizard by the name of Ekrizdis, who practiced various kinds of dark magic in the fortress and lured muggle sailors there to torture and kill them. After his death, the concealment charms faded, revealing the fortress, which had been infested with dementors. Wizarding authorities feared destroying the fortress, as it was home to so many dementors, which would then look for another residence.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> When the International Statute of Secrecy was enacted in 1692, small wizarding prisons became a hazard. Plans were drawn for the building of a new wizarding prison on a small Hebridean island; however, when Damocles Rowle was elected as Minister for Magic, he insisted on using Azkaban as the prison instead, seeing its dementors as assets. </em>
</p><p>
<em> This plan was eventually put into motion, despite protests, and its efficacy wasn’t questioned until Minister Eldritch Diggory visited the island in 1735, and became horrified by the inhumane conditions and the levels of despair and insanity which dementors inflicted upon prisoners. Diggory put together a committee to find alternative measures and guards for the prison, but ultimately his efforts came to naught as he passed away in an untimely manner after contracting Dragon Pox. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Since then, the prison’s effectiveness has gone unquestioned and unchallenged by Britain’s wizarding community at large. However, we must ask ourselves, can dementors, who exhibit no distinct loyalties, really be trusted as guards with Britain’s most dangerous criminals? Dementors are, after all, motivated by their food source: the happiness and positive emotions of witches and wizards.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> My father, Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Albus Dumbledore, has long been an outspoken voice against the use of dementors as guards at Azkaban prison.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Utilizing their motivations could result in a dangerous shift in loyalties. Perhaps that has already been happening? There is no other explanation for this seemingly non-magical breach of such an impenetrable fortress. </em>
</p><p>
<em> And what of this terrifying gang of dark wizards? These types of sleeper cells which continue to keep anti-muggle bigotry alive are the very danger we must be wary of in the wizarding world. Though they lie in wait, they threaten our existence as we know it. Dark magic is a cancer in our society, and blood purity ideology will continue to divide our communities and poison Britain’s populace if we allow it.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> There is a dangerous prisoner now at large, who is capable of extreme magical violence and destruction. Was this the plan of this dark alliance all along? Was Cyrus Pilloughby indeed framed for this heinous crime, an easy scapegoat for this terrorist group’s nefarious agenda? </em>
</p><p>
<em> As for the leader of this gang; I, Hermione Dumbledore, have one thing to say to you. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Bow out now, because your time is coming. </em>
</p><p>

</p><hr/><p> </p><p>Tom stood in his old professor’s office. He glanced around, remembering the countless Slug Club meetings he’d attended in this office.</p><p>“How wonderful it is to see you again, my boy,” Slughorn exclaimed as he clapped Tom on the back. “You’ve been well, I hope?”</p><p>“Quite well, Professor.”</p><p>“I confess, I’m rather curious as to the nature of your asking after this specific potion. It is quite obscure… and it only has one use, really. The purpose of this potion is to determine if one’s significant other is their soulmate. It is truthfully more of a myth. I’ve never heard of anyone ever brewing the potion, much less using it in such a manner.” Slughorn cast a side eye toward Riddle. “Is there a lucky witch… <em> or </em>wizard, I suppose should ask? What reason do you have for wanting to brew such a potion?”</p><p>Tom smiled congenially. “There is a witch, sir.”</p><p>“Oh, but that’s wonderful Tom! Who is the lucky witch?”</p><p>Tom tilted his head. “We are keeping things private, for the time being.”</p><p>Slughorn’s eyebrows drew forward. “Oh, oh, I see. Well, that’s… admirable. I suppose that’s always a good idea these days. I confess, I’d always imagined you’d settle down with Miss Black, seeing as you were always rather close, but I see she’s engaged to Mr. Orion Black. They do like to keep it in the family, mind you. Very powerful lineage, the Blacks. They see to it that it stays that way.”</p><p>“They certainly do, sir.”</p><p>Slughorn stood looking at Riddle for a moment, then smacked his lips. “Right. Well, I do still have a copy of the book that contains the brewing instructions. As I wrote, it’s out of print now.” He began rifling through his desk and produced an old, faded book.</p><p>“May I ask, sir,” Riddle began, “how the potion is supposed to work?”</p><p>“Oh, well… you’ll need the tears of your witch. That is one of the key ingredients. As I recall, it takes about three months to brew, and… ah yes! Here it is.” He flipped the book open to the page containing the potion recipe. “Yes, eighty-eight days to brew the potion.”</p><p>“May I see, sir?”</p><p>“Certainly, certainly!” He handed Tom the book.</p><p>Tom gazed at the page, noting that it was a rather complex potion with several rare and costly ingredients.</p><p> </p><p><b><em>Tears of Adonis</em></b> <em>(Brewing Instructions)</em></p><p>
<em> Ingredients: </em>
</p><p>
<em> A pinch of Salt of the Nile </em>
</p><p>
<em> 2 Tears of the Soulmate </em>
</p><p>
<em> 5 drops of Dragon’s Blood </em>
</p><p>
<em> 2 Fairy Wings </em>
</p><p>
<em> 3 pinches of Powdered Griffin Claw </em>
</p><p>
<em> 20 drops of Honey Water </em>
</p><p>
<em> One sprig of dried lavender (leaves only, crushed with mortar and pestle) </em>
</p><p>
<em> 37 drops of Morning Dew </em>
</p><p>
<em> 1 drop of Neem oil </em>
</p><p>
<em> 2 fresh nightshade leaves </em>
</p><p><em> 1 head of starthistle, dried and finely chopped </em> <em><br/>
<br/>
</em></p><p>
<b> <em>Instructions:</em> </b>
</p><p> </p><ol>
<li><em> Add all ingredients to a small cauldron, excluding the griffin claw, dragon’s blood, and soulmate tears</em></li>
<li>On the night of the half-moon of the first month, stir five times counterclockwise</li>
<li>On the morning of the full moon in the second month, add the tears of the soulmate, griffin claw, and dragon’s blood. Stir three times clockwise</li>
<li>On the 80th day, stir eleven times counterclockwise, then tap cauldron five times with wand</li>
<li>On the 88th day, potion will be finished brewing. It should be a white, pearlescent consistency, like an abalone shell.</li>
<li>Add two tears of the brewer.</li>
</ol><p> </p><p>
<em> If the potion turns blue, the pair are true soulmates </em>
</p><p><em> If the potion turns red, they are not a match. </em> <em><br/>
<br/>
</em></p><p>“As you can see, Tom, when the potion is finished brewing, you’ll add your tears. If the potion turns blue-”</p><p>“She’s my soulmate.”</p><p>“Er- yes. But, Tom, this is all quite <em> mythological </em>. It’s practically legend. One shouldn’t base a match upon such a potion. It has not been tested or researched.”</p><p>“Certainly, sir. I don’t plan on it. I’m quite set on her, regardless of the potion. It’s simply a… <em> bonus </em>.” Tom winked. </p><p>Slughorn laughed. “Why don’t you brew it here, Tom? I’m sure I have most of the ingredients. I can keep it locked up in a spare brewing room. It will be like old times! Potions class, remember?”</p><p>Tom chuckled. “How could I forget? Mcnair has a permanent scar from the time he blew up his cauldron by incorrectly brewing Doxycide.”<br/>
<br/>
Slughorn made a perturbed face. “Well, who the devil puts <em> hemp leaves </em>instead of hemlock essence in Doxycide? Never was the brightest student, that one.”</p><p>Tom fought back a smile.</p><p>“Right, Tom. You know where my potion stores are, run back there and grab the list and I’ll ready the cauldron. You’ll need to be back here later this month with the tears, on the night of the first half-moon.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Hermione lay on her back in Tom’s bed that night. He was laid on his side facing her; his arm rested possessively across her stomach. The moon was bright, and its light permeated the dark room, illuminating his face. His eyes were closed, his expression peaceful in sleep.<br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow was Sunday. She would go for tea and training with Dumbledore tomorrow.</p><p>She didn’t want to think about Dumbledore while she was in Tom’s bed. Something about it pained her.</p><p>Hermione had intended to cook for Tom, but the night had taken a different turn. They’d spent the entire evening in bed, kissing for hours, touching and exploring their bodies, and whispering in the darkness.</p><p>His moods gave her whiplash. She never knew which Tom to expect. At times, he was suspicious and paranoid. Other times, he was violent and possessive. Then, other times, he could be quite soft and gentle.</p><p>He was often rough and aggressive with her during sex, like there was some feral, uncontained part of him that he needed to exorcise with her as if she were his priest. But after, he tended to treat her as if she were made of glass.</p><p>Then there was the very intellectual and studious Tom, who was so very like herself. When they spoke of magic that night, it was in hushed whispers and theoretical conjectures. He brought up questions she had never considered herself, and he challenged her own line of thinking. </p><p>When he’d first asked her to come every night, she had thought at some point their interactions might become stale, but she found herself quite surprised. Their interactions smoothly flowed between easy, lighthearted banter, intense physical attraction, and deeply philosophical discussions. When silence descended, it was never awkward as she would have expected. It was a peaceful silence, not tense and uncomfortable, but a silence filled with the pleasure of the other’s company, which was oddly enough, all that was required. Tom didn’t expect her to speak. He merely expected her to exist in his space.</p><p>Hermione couldn't help the distinct feeling of <em> understanding </em> him, and of <em> being </em> understood.</p><p>How was it that she felt so known by the one person she should hate?</p><p>He made her feel as if she could truly accomplish anything she set her mind to. He made her feel <em> invincible </em>.</p><p>She looked at his face. It was the face of a tremendously <em> dangerous </em>dark wizard. But to Hermione, it was the face of a lover.</p><p>Was that what Tom Riddle was to her?</p><p>The thought terrified her.</p><p>How could such a paradox exist within herself? In these quiet moments, when he was asleep, she thought of all the ways she could fight him. She steeled herself, reminding herself of the duty she had to her loved ones. She reminded herself that he was evil; that he likely could not be changed. </p><p><em> I cannot change him </em> , she thought. <em> I will kill him. It’s the only way </em>.</p><p>His hand rested against her skin. She could feel the cool metal of his ring against her arm. She looked at his face. His handsome face looked almost angelic.</p><p>How deceptive.</p><p>Harry was called the boy who lived.</p><p>But Tom was the boy no one wanted.</p><p>“I want you,” Hermione whispered.</p><p>It was too late for that. Hermione knew that the damage was already done.</p><p>Now she had to kill him.</p><p>Would she be able to do it, when the time came?</p><p>How was it that this perfect specimen of man would become one of the most dangerous dark wizards that had ever existed?</p><p>Hermione remembered watching documentaries about serial killers with her parents during the summers and wondering how their own friends and families had always thought them wonderful people. She’d thought them delusional for ignoring all the signs. </p><p>Was Hermione also that delusional?</p><p>She swallowed. She knew the answer.</p><p>But yet...</p><p>She looked at Tom’s face. His pale skin glowed ethereally in the moonlight.</p><p>She <em> wanted </em>him.</p><p>Hermione thought that perhaps he wanted her, too.</p><p>Her chest ached and she threw out a prayer to the magic in the universe. </p><p>She prayed, as insignificant as she was… that somehow, she could be enough to save him.</p><p>She didn’t hope.</p><p>She didn’t believe. </p><p>She merely prayed, and then fell asleep.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p>Hermione’s article created quite the stir in wizarding Britain. There were murmurs throughout the Ministry, and the streets were rife with unrest. The greater magical population of Britain was terrified of the thought of a dangerous prisoner loose in their midst, and whispers of a dark wizard gang spread through the magical sectors of London. The Department of Magical Law Enforcement received an influx of post, howlers and letters from angry witches and wizards, demanding that more information about the prisoner be released. Azkaban became a talking point for the ministerial election, which was on the horizon for the month of October. Was the prison still effective to house Britain’s most dangerous criminals? Were dementors really adequate guards? It was on everyone’s tongue of late.</p><p>Fear and insurgency were the attitude. Witches and wizards everywhere became suspicious of purebloods, even accusing them of being part of conspiracies. </p><p>There was immense pressure at the Ministry to do something about Cyrus Pilloughby. Post flooded in, demanding his release. Gaspard Dufresne, while somewhat irritated with the article and the pressures that came with it, was almost relieved. Before the article was released, anytime he’d mentioned that Cyrus was likely framed, his superiors had hushed him up. They needed a fall guy, and he was the perfect candidate. He had no wife or family, no close friends to speak of. They wanted the whole business taken care of and swept under the rug before the public caught wind of the breach. Even Minister Moon had insinuated that it was unlikely that they would capture the person responsible, if Cyrus was truly being framed. The evidence was right there; he’d been at the prison. It looked incriminating, and no one would blame the Ministry with that kind of evidence staring them in the face.</p><p>Of course, he would have had a trial, but it would’ve been a quiet one, with no real substance. </p><p>But now, the entire trial was highly publicized, and the Ministry had changed their tune dramatically. Now, Gaspard was under heavy pressure to investigate the potential framing of Pilloughby. It was an almost impossible task, but he felt better about the possibility that Cyrus might go free. He couldn’t stomach the thought of an innocent man being sent to that terrible place. </p><p>He even agreed with Hermione about her assessment of Azkaban and its guards. </p><p>With one article, she’d been able to accomplish what many politicians and ministry workers had not. There had been discussions for many years about the inadequacy of Azkaban, but none had ever been able to instill such doubt in the minds of the Brits. Gaspard marveled at Hermione’s intuition and power to effect change.</p><p>Gaspard sat in his office and stared down at an old copy of The Prophet. Hermione’s photo stared back at him. </p><p>He had tried not to think of her in the two weeks since she’d shown up in his office, asking a million questions. </p><p>He thought her a handsome witch. He’d been surprised by and somewhat attracted to her tenacity. </p><p>Gaspard hadn’t thought about a witch since his wife passed away.</p><p>Of course, the witch was almost half his age. He was thirty-eight, and in the past ten years since his wife died, he’d not sought out any companionship. He’d focused on his career. </p><p>At age thirty, he became the youngest ever Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. Gaspard was even somewhat of a legend in the wizarding world. He’d rounded up and imprisoned more dark wizards in the aftermath of the war than any auror had to date. </p><p>He’d been the one to put Dominik Hausler behind bars. It grated on his nerves to have an evil magical scientist once again on the loose. Especially since he had a grisly scar on his left side from his encounter with that particular wizard.</p><p>Despite his attraction to the witch, he was impressed with her. How has she been able to uncover this knowledge of an organization of dark wizards? He’d heard whispers of it before. But they were just that. Whispers. He’d never had any solid evidence, much less any connection between the group and a real crime. </p><p>It was an intriguing bit of information. But Gaspard feared there would be no other leads, no other evidence for him to go on. There were procedures and protocols which he had to adhere to, after all.</p><p>Gaspard stared at her photograph. He couldn’t help thinking that she was a rather brilliant witch for one so young.</p><p>There was a Ministry event coming up. The inaugural banquet following the election, in which politicians could give their speeches and schmooze Britain’s wealthiest and most influential citizens. </p><p>Gaspard was expected to be there. He wanted to ask Hermione Dumbledore to attend with him, but when it came down to it, he felt bloody awkward asking her. </p><p>Perhaps because she was quite a bit younger than him. </p><p>Perhaps because she was Albus Dumbledore’s daughter. Dumbledore was a good friend of his, after all.</p><p>Perhaps because he hadn’t pursued anything resembling a romantic connection in almost ten years.</p><p>He sighed. There was no help for it. If he didn’t step out and ask her, it would drive him crazy.</p><p>He pulled a sheet of parchment which bore the DMLE seal at the top, and wrote her a letter. He would owl her on the morrow.</p>

<em> “Her heart sank into her shoes as she realized at last now much she wanted him. No matter what his past was, no matter what he had done. Which was not to say that she would ever let him know, but only that he moved her chemically more than anyone she had ever met, that all other men seemed pale beside him.” </em>
</p><p align="center">F. Scott Fitzgerald, A New Leaf</p><p> </p><p>Hermione straddled Tom’s waist, impaled on his cock as he gripped her hips, his fingers digging into the flesh of her side. He held her suspended in the air as he drove upwards into her, over and over. He preferred this position. He could fuck her hard and deep, stroking that sweet spot inside her and watching her face twist into an expression of torturous pleasure. His black eyes glittered dangerously. </p><p>“That’s it,” he murmured. “You’re doing so good, little witch.”</p><p>She bit her lip whenever he praised her.</p><p>He often had to stimulate her in order to bring her to release, but in this position, he could bring her to an explosive orgasm nearly every time. He always relished the look on her face; just the anticipation of it almost sent him over the edge.</p><p>Hermione moaned, a sensual, husky sound. Her head fell back and she gasped, breathless, her hair tumbling wildly over her shoulders. Red crept down her throat and spread through her chest, a sign that she was close.</p><p>“Fuck, Hermione.” Tom’s ab muscles contracted as he thrust into her, a sheen of sweat glistening on his skin from the exertion. He watched where they connected, the way her tight cunt hugged his cock as he pulled out of her just to drive himself into her again. Small bruises bloomed on her skin where his fingers bit into her flesh. Tom stared at them. He wanted to leave them everywhere. </p><p>He was breathless and his muscles were taut. His head fell back, the cords of his throat and Adam's apple straining, his too-long hair falling over his forehead messily, and Hermione thought there was no more attractive sight. Her chest tightened painfully as she looked at him. She reached a hand forward and ran her fingers over his tendons and neck muscles as her eyes rolled back in bliss. He drove upward and into her hard and deep, hitting a particular angle that drove her to insanity. She clenched her walls around his cock, letting out another moan as she lost control. </p><p>Her mouth fell open. “That’s a good little witch,” Tom rasped hoarsely. “Let me hear you scream.”</p><p>She cried out, her vision blackening with little rainbow-colored stars as pleasure rocketed through her, spreading out in numbing waves through her core. Tom’s fingers wrapped around her throat. “Who do you belong to, Hermione?”</p><p>“You,” she whispered, struggling for air as her body pulsed in ecstasy. “You, Tom.”</p><p>“Mine,” he gritted through his teeth, and then with a deep, rough thrust, he spilled inside her. </p><p>He released her throat and slid his hand around the nape of her neck, pulling her forward until she fell against his chest, her nipples teasing his chest hair gently. “Mine,” he breathed. Their bodies were vibrating against one another, chests shaking with the violent pounding of their hearts. </p><p>In that moment, Tom vowed he would find a way to bind the pieces of his soul to hers, not for only one lifetime, but for eternity.</p><p>He felt he had a right to do so.</p><p>She belonged to him, after all.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Afterward, as she lay in bed beside him, her head on his chest, staring around his room as if memorizing it, she felt all the unspoken things between them. He’d poured them several glasses of firewhiskey throughout the night and Hermione was tipsy, although Tom handled alcohol well and never seemed to show signs of being drunk. </p><p>He gazed at her in an offensively intimate manner. </p><p>He knew that she was keeping secrets. She knew that he knew it. And yet, he did not force her to reveal them, as she knew that he very well could. </p><p>She felt it in the quiet moments after they slept together, in the span of time before they both fell asleep. She could sense him thinking, wondering, searching for answers. She feared that he would one day discover everything she was hiding. He was too intelligent and clever not to. </p><p>Stranger still, whenever Hermione fought him, his principles, his ideals, or even his Death Eaters, whether with her words in public or her articles, he never mentioned it or confronted her. If he had, then she would have felt better. But he didn’t, and so she didn’t feel better, because it made the arrangement between them too intimate. It was as if he was so self assured in knowing that he would one day uncover everything she sought to hide. As if one day, they would be one and all their conflict would have meant nothing. It alarmed and frightened Hermione, because within herself, she knew that it was impossible and yet, simultaneously, she desired that outcome more than anything.</p><p>When she had come to his flat the evening after her article was released about Azkaban, she saw a copy of The Prophet lying face up on his dining table, her article on the front page. He never said a word about the article, but he let her stare at it as he stared at her. Both knew that the other knew, but neither said a word. He’d pushed her skirt up around her waist and gripped her thighs, lifting her and setting her on top of the table, directly onto the paper. He pressed her back against the wood table and fucked her while he stared down at their bodies joining on top of her article. His cum had leaked out of her, right onto the headline.</p><p>

</p><p><br/>Tom Riddle was dominating her like she’d never thought a man capable, quietly and confidently. It was forcefully smooth, and aggressively passive. She’d never felt more safe and at the same time, more frightened of a man in her life. He was an ever tightening noose around her neck.</p><p>Everything she had come to know and believe about herself was crumbling. Hermione felt that she was being broken, both by a man she loathed and a man that she admired.</p><p>“Tom...”</p><p>“Hermione.”</p><p>“Why haven’t you asked me why I’m fighting you?”</p><p>He was quiet for a moment. He was propped up against the headboard, a cigarette in one hand and his other arm wrapped around her where she lay against him. He took a deep breath. “Because I know you have reasons for it that you won’t tell me. I’ve already asked you many times to share your secrets, and you refuse. I’m not going to continue asking only to get the same answer.”</p><p>“Does that not make you angry?”</p><p>“It angers me greatly.”</p><p>“You told me once you had decided against using legilimency on me. Why?”</p><p>He stared at her as he sucked in smoke through his cigarette. “You know why.”</p><p>She gazed up at him. She feared his answer. “Do I?”</p><p>He ejected smoke through his nose and mouth. “You do. You know I want <em> you </em>more than I want answers at the moment.”</p><p>“At the moment?”</p><p>He took another drag. “There will come a time, Hermione, when you will have to decide if you want me more than you want your secrets. But I’m a patient man.”</p><p>Hermione swallowed. “Tom…”<br/><br/>“Don‘t give in before you’re ready, Hermione. You’ll regret it.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>He blew a smoke ring as he gazed at her, head cocked. “I find you very beautiful, little witch.”</p><p>She sighed. “Don’t do that. Don't be nice to me.”</p><p>“You’re perfect.”</p><p>His compliments struck her violently, as if he'd hit her.</p><p>She flicked her eyes at him. “Tom, I have to fight against everything you stand for. No matter what there is between us... We disagree fundamentally on nearly everything.”</p><p>He laughed bitterly under his breath. “And I think I want you more for that reason.”</p><p>“Tom…”</p><p>“Does it bother you to hear me say it? That I want you?”</p><p>Hermione’s chest ached. He said those things because he knew that it pained her, not because he thought it would please her.</p><p>His last thought was to please her. He wanted to hurt her, to stretch her, to challenge her. To pull her beyond herself.</p><p>He relished making her want him, because he knew she didn’t want to want him.</p><p>Hermione had never felt so possessed by anyone in her life.</p><p>Tom put out his cigarette, then waved his wand, turning down the lights. “Go to sleep, Hermione. You’ll wake up and feel more chipper tomorrow. I’ll make you tea and you’ll fix me breakfast. Then you’ll go to work and think of all the ways you might discredit me to the entire wizarding world. Good night, little witch.”<br/><br/><br/></p><hr/><p> </p><p>When Hermione wasn’t with Tom, she wandered the city. She gazed at the buildings and listened to the roar of the London traffic. She wandered Diagon Alley, Vertic, Horizont. When Tom was away or preoccupied with his studies, she stood out over her balcony at night with her arms stretched wide, hands on either side of the railing, as if she were a part of it and a part of the skyline. But she knew she was not.</p><p>She went out for long walks alone in the chilly autumn air. October was descending, haunting London like desolate fog in a cemetery. She would put on her long cloak or sometimes a trench coat with the collar pulled up high around her cheeks, walking fast as her heels clicked briskly on the cobblestone. She gazed at the faces of those she passed in the streets and wondered how her presence here would affect them. How much had she already altered the events of the future? She would never know. In all likelihood, she would never go back to her time, and even if she did, she couldn’t be sure that anyone would still know her. But how does one let go of everyone they’ve ever known and loved? How does one’s entire life become wiped away in the span of a day?</p><p>Hermione was not free any longer. Each step she took through London hurt her soul. She was tied to him - as he was tied to every part of this city and this time. This city was not the same for her now, and it never would be again. Even if she went back to her time, she would no longer belong there.</p><p>Hermione often visited the site of the new wizarding bank. The construction would be finalized in a few months. Hermione found it strange, moving forward with her life here in the past. It felt like moving backward somehow. She wandered past the three-story brick factory, Portsmouth Potions. She imagined what she would do with it if she owned it. One day she even broke into it with a well-placed spell and wandered the bottom floor. It became a dream of hers, something she thought of in her spare moments, which were very few and far between.</p><p>Hermione became a fixture in social settings. She moved through formal receptions, parties, dinners, dances, and balls, gracious and smiling. She danced and laughed, always on the arm of some handsome young wizard. She had no shortage of invitations, but she kept them in frequent circulation so as not to mislead hearts <em> or </em>the public. Magical Britain had an unhealthy obsession with Hermione’s dating life, though the gossip tabloids could not have been farther from the truth.</p><p>Tom often seemed to weave in and out of those social obligations as well, though she knew that he disliked them. She often saw him from afar, mingling with the pureblooded set and being introduced around by Wilhemina Tuft. Wilhelmina was weeks away from being elected, and she was, for all appearances, a very gracious and likable public figure. She had a pleasing and commanding voice; she made inspiring and heartfelt speeches. She was also pleasantly neutral on all political matters. <em> Too </em>neutral. Hermione didn’t like her closeness to Tom, nor her friendship with him, and her desire to parade him around made Hermione question her motives.</p><p>Hermione noticed that Riddle’s name began to be brought up often in conversation. All of London was wondering about the mysterious shopboy who, rumor had it, was a magical prodigy and a political force to be reckoned with. She suspected that Tuft had a great deal to do with it, and something about that irked Hermione. </p><p>Hermione would often watch him from across the room when she thought he wasn’t looking, hating each person that shook his hand and every person who gave him a coy smile. She would envy his jacket and his cufflinks and the glass of firewhiskey in his hand, and the very air he breathed, only to have him turn his gaze on her with a smirk, as if he’d known all along that she’d been watching him. </p><p>When anyone brought up Riddle’s name to her, she talked him down.</p><p>“Of course, I’ve met him, to my utter misfortune. I happen to find him arrogant, and a bit lofty. Oh yes, he’s quite magically accomplished, but it’s too bad, he wastes his talent in that dreadful little shop on Knockturn Alley. Yes, <em> Knockturn Alley </em> . But one shouldn’t be surprised, he’s always seen running with the most bigoted and prejudiced crowds in London. Not very good company to keep. I hear he even mingles with <em> giants </em>. What do I think of him personally? Well, that’s just it, isn’t it? I don’t think of him.”</p><p>She lied beautifully and with arresting laughter, as she’d learned to do fluently the past year. She lied for her loved ones, for the lives of people she didn’t even know, and she lied for herself, and most of all, she lied for Tom’s soul.</p><p>Late at night, often, she showed up to Riddle’s flat. She showed up unannounced, certain of finding him there alone, and waiting for her. He was her adversary, and even their bodies seemed to know it. Their coming together was more often than not, an act of violence and a wrestling of powers, both fighting for control.</p><p>Riddle always demanded surrender, which was made more complete by the force of her resistance. It was passion in the truest and basest sense of the word - suffering. His inevitable triumph turned her tense loathing into its inversion, her torment into its antithesis: ecstasy.</p><p>She came into his flat from a party, wearing a silver evening gown that was both costly and delicate, a coating of silk like a spiderweb over her body. She glanced at the leaking ceiling and the crude kitchen table loaded with Riddle’s parchments and study materials, letting her eyes wander over every object around her, his various magical instruments and books laid open where he’d left them in a chaotic semblance of order. He sometimes brought objects back from Borgin and Burkes to study them for their magical properties, analyzing their enchantments, and he’d make notes on pieces of parchment. He had many journals, but she never saw <em> the </em>journal.</p><p>She liked to wander about his flat, to throw her satin gloves down in the center of his books and leave her earrings on his parchments, to take off her diamond necklace and drop it in his ashtray. She hung her beaded bag on his towel rack and left her knickers under his pillow, a practice he did not complain about in the slightest.</p><p>“Hello, <em> Voldemort </em>,” she breathed tacitly as she stood behind his chair, dropping her arms over his shoulders as he hunched over his notes on a new arithmancy theory. It still frightened her to say it, so she said it as often as possible, because it reminded her of who he was. She slid her hand down his shirt, her fingers spread flat to his chest. </p><p>He spoke in a smooth, deep voice that sent shivers down her spine. “Tell me, little witch. What do you think of that chap, Tom Riddle?”</p><p>She leaned over his shoulder and her lips brushed his ear. “I hear he runs with <em> giants </em>,” she whispered.</p><p>She heard the sound of his chuckle, but he didn’t turn back to look at her; he merely wrapped his fingers around her wrist and pulled her hand down into his shirt, pressing her hand flat against his chest. Then she pulled his head back and bent down to cover his mouth with hers.</p><p>When they broke apart, he muttered, “And you don’t think of him at all, is that right?”</p><p>She looked at him, his features upside down, Adam's apple protruding with the craning of his neck. “I don’t know him,” she murmured. “I don’t know the man the rest of the world sees.” She ran her fingers along his chiseled cheek. “I only know <em> you</em>.”</p><p>One night, she came home to find Tom seated in his favorite armchair. On the floor at his feet was a copy of The Prophet. It lay open to her latest article, which contained this line:</p><p>“Why is it that the <em> best </em> that the muggle-haters of Britain have to offer is a bigoted boys’ club and a Slytherin shopboy for a leader? It is a <em> riddle </em>so profoundly mundane that it might as well be the admittance question for the Ravenclaw common room.”</p><p>He beckoned her to kneel on the paper, and proceeded to instruct her in the ways to please him with her mouth. </p><p>He’d tangled his fingers in her hair and praised her, calling her a perfect student.</p><p>Hermione saved the paper.</p><p>Once, she came in and found him working at his kitchen table. He said, “I’m studying. Sit down and wait.” He did not look at her again. </p><p>She waited silently, sitting in a little chair at the far end of the room. She watched him feverishly studying and writing, his dark brows drawn in concentration, mouth tight as he thought. She observed the way he bit his cheek, and how his veins protruded from his forearms, his long fingers with their blunt nails as he wrote. She merely wanted to observe him this way. Not Voldemort, but simply Tom. Studious and committed to excellence. Striving for greatness. Focused and unyielding. He almost seemed saint-like to Hermione; there was such a purity about his pursuit of magic. It was unfortunate that he’d chosen the dark arts. Tom Riddle would be great in any capacity, no matter what goal he set his sails toward. </p><p>Later that night, Riddle lay in bed, propped up against the headboard, his legs spread and one knee bent, with a book in his hand. Hermione lay between his legs, her back against his stomach and her head resting on his chest, also reading. </p><p>“Tom?”</p><p>“What is it?” </p><p>Riddle always got mildly irritated when interrupted doing anything. She was learning his various ticks and pet peeves, which were many, as he was one of the most manic and OCD individuals she’d ever met. When his full attention was on something, he became nearly murderous if forced to break his concentration.</p><p>She did it anyway.<br/><br/>If he was going to stretch her, she would stretch him too.</p><p>“What was it like for you? At the orphanage.”</p><p>He was quiet for a moment, then he lowered his book. “Crowded.”</p><p>“Because of the war?”</p><p>He nodded. “There wasn’t enough of anything to go around, because a lot of the resources went to the war. There were lots of orphans, particularly quite a few from Germany who were displaced here. They were all there by necessity, of course… and not because of a looney mother and a heartless father.”</p><p>Hermione threaded her fingers in his. “Do you think you’re anything like him?”</p><p>He scoffed. “I bloody well hope not. Do you think me heartless, Hermione?”</p><p>“You certainly do kill, maim, and torture fairly easily. The threats simply roll off your tongue.”</p><p>He snickered. “Says the girl who sliced open Walburga’s chest and murdered a dark wizard in cold blood. I think you’ll soon learn that those things are merely <em> circumstantial </em>. But I would never leave a child of mine to fare in an orphanage while I lived in opulent wealth and affluence.”</p><p>“Do you want children?”</p><p>“No,” he said flatly. “I would be a terrible father. But hypothetically, if it did happen, whether by choice or by accident, I would never be the father that mine was to me… or rather, the father he wasn’t.”</p><p>Hermione grew quiet.</p><p>Tom looked down at her and dropped his book. “Do you want children, Hermione?”</p><p>She fixed her gaze on the closet door. “I used to. I don’t know what I want anymore.”</p><p>Tom watched her for a moment, then tilted his head and began to suck on her neck, dragging his teeth against the sensitive spot behind her ear. His hand cupped her breast, and he whispered hoarsely against the shell of her ear, “Well, I know what I want.”</p><p>“Mmm,” Hermione hummed with a soft smile, her breath catching as he squeezed her chest gently. “And what’s that?”</p><p>He bit her ear, then muttered, “Scones.”</p><p>Hermione laughed and stood, dropping her book on Mermaid etiquette in favor of baking. After all, it was her favorite distraction. She kept her old set of baking dishes at his flat, since Piksy had bought her new ones, so that his flat was always well stocked with various pastries and cakes.</p><p>She snuck an elixir while she was in the kitchen.</p>

<p>Several Death Eaters lounged around in the Malfoy Manor drawing room. Edward Rosier sat deep in his chair, legs stretched before the immense stone fireplace which was lit and blazing. The glass french doors which led out onto the balcony were open, allowing the crisp, fall air to filter in, along with the cold sunshine. Ragnor Lestrange and Daegan Rookwood stood outside with pipes of Veela leaves lit, talking in muted voices. Acacius Nott sat at a warlock-crafted grand piano, letting his nimble fingers drift over the keys, playing a lilting melody. Maximilian Dolohov, Charles Macnair, and Abraxas Malfoy sat in the velvet sofas and chairs in front of the fire. </p><p>The fireplace flared in a burst of green flames, allowing William Avery to arrive via floo. He stepped out of the fireplace and waved his wand, clearing his clothing of ash and dust.</p><p>“Glad you could make it,” Malfoy sneered.</p><p>“Piss off,” Avery huffed. “I got caught up at the ministry.”</p><p>“There’s nothing exciting happening anyway,” Dolohov yawned.</p><p>“Aren’t we supposed to be dueling today?” Macnair asked.</p><p>“Tom’s in Albania.”</p><p>“How the hell does the bloke get there and back so quickly? Do you imagine he’s got an illegal portkey set up?” asked Avery.</p><p>“Fuck if I know,” Dolohov said dismissively.</p><p>“What’s got your wand in a knot?”</p><p>Dolohov reached into his robes and pulled out a copy of the Prophet and tossed it onto the coffee table. His hands still had tremors from Tom’s cruciatus. Avery picked it up and began to read the front page article.</p><p>After a minute, Avery’s eyebrow lifted sharply. “D’you reckon Tom knows about this?”</p><p>Dolohov nodded soberly.</p><p>Avery scowled, his eyes narrowing. </p><p>“The bitch is too bold,” Dolohov muttered. “And getting bolder by the day. Something needs to be done.”</p><p>“She’s Dumbledore’s daughter,” Abraxas sighed.</p><p>“The more reason she needs to go,” Dolohov spat.</p><p>“I thought you said she could be an ally, Brax,” muttered Avery, tossing the paper to Malfoy. “Look at the state of things now.”</p><p>Abraxas glared daggers at him.</p><p>“Perhaps you could seduce her, Abraxas, since you seem to have a soft spot for her,” Macnair teased. “I’m sure some good cock could convince her to switch sides.”</p><p>“I wouldn’t even attempt it, if I were you,” snickered Dolohov.</p><p>“Why?” They each said it all at once.</p><p>Dolohov jutted his jaw to the side. “Word on the street is, she and Tom are shagging.”</p><p>Abraxas chuckled. “That’s not the word on the street.”</p><p>“No, but it’s what I’ve heard.”</p><p>“From who?” Malfoy asked tersely.</p><p>“That’s my little secret.”</p><p>“No,” Malfoy shook his head. “That can’t be true. She’s not his type.”</p><p>“We don’t really know what his type is,” muttered Avery. “Could be blokes.”</p><p>“She’s a Gryffindor,” Malfoy scoffed. “Tom despises them.”</p><p>“I saw her,” interjected Dolohov.</p><p>“What?” Malfoy spat.</p><p>“Leaving his flat one morning, very early. I saw her.”</p><p>The room was silent. Even Acacius ceased his gentle plunking of the piano keys. Lestrange and Rookwood had turned their attention to the conversation as well.</p><p>Dolohov leaned forward. “Can you imagine if he gets his nuts twisted by a barmy muggle-lover like her? There goes our whole cause, out the bloody window.”</p><p>“That will never happen,” Malfoy said with a smirk. “Tom is too focused. He’s committed. He’s not one to let a witch get in his way.”</p><p>Dolohov scoffed. “That is certainly what she’s attempting to do. No doubt about it.”</p><p>“Well, we will certainly have to keep an eye on it, won’t we?” Malfoy replied tightly.</p><p>“Tom has Tuft in his back pocket,” Macnair called out as he stood at a golden bar cart, pouring a glass of brandy. “If we need anyone to… <em> disappear </em>, I’m sure she would be more than willing to aid the cause.”</p><p>“Be a shame if someone poisoned her earl grey,” Dolohov murmured with a grin.</p><p>“Yes, but will Riddle go along with it?” asked Avery apprehensively.</p><p>“He will,” Malfoy nodded. “I’m sure of it.”</p><p>“Should we…” Avery cast a nervous glance around. “Should we obliviate this conversation?”</p><p>Dolohov ran his fingers over the scruff on his cheeks. “That would probably be wise.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Tom finally paid a visit to Hermione’s flat. He noticed she had put away many of the books he’d seen when he’d astral projected. He knew it was significant, but he said nothing; he merely filed it away in the back of his mind where he put all of her other suspicious actions. Each addition was like another puzzle piece, and Tom was rapidly putting them all together.</p><p>Her secrets drove him absolutely mad. He had to constantly remind himself that he couldn’t deal with Hermione the way he dealt with his Death Eaters. He had to approach his relationship with her more delicately. It was yet another paradox within Tom’s person. Her secrets pushed him to insanity, and yet, he wanted her to tell him herself. He was obsessed with somehow drawing them out of her like siphoning the poison from a wound. He knew that if he were to force the truth from her, she would hate him.</p><p>Though, she already hated him. She hated him as much as she wanted him; it was glaringly obvious, and he had yet to discover why.</p><p>Tom had decided that her secrets were of a darker nature. He had several theories. Her maternal lineage was one of them. Another was that it was entirely possible that she was a time traveler. He couldn’t ignore that there was a connection to his Tempaestus. He’d had too many dreams to ignore that possibility. She seemed to somehow have knowledge of things that were rather obscure, but she acted as if they were common knowledge. Then, she seemed to have a rather uncanny understanding of Tom himself. He couldn’t help feeling as if she knew his secrets when she shouldn’t know <em> anything </em>at all. It made him want to rip his hair from his head. He often took his frustration out on her during sex, being a bit more rough than he needed to be. He didn’t feel good about it, but she didn’t seem to mind. She almost seemed to crave his violence. He’d told her, of course, that she should stop him if his actions ever became too much for her. But to his surprise, she never did.</p><p>She was a very surprising witch, Tom decided. He couldn’t ever quite figure her out. When he began to expect a certain thing from her, she turned around and did the opposite.</p><p>He coveted her. He hated to watch her leave his flat to go to work in the mornings. The invisible tether that bound them would tighten, pulling more and more taut as she moved further away from him. He wanted to grab it and yank her back. Her absence left a bitter, poisonous taste in his mouth. He frequently had visions of branding her with his dark mark; a private one, which was only meant for his use. Then he would be able to call her to him, and she to him, if she were in danger. Tom was growing manic. His witch was making quite a few enemies and he found himself thinking compulsively throughout the day of the many ways someone could try to harm her. He subversively checked all the wards and protective enchantments on her flat, then rechecked them. It became a compulsive habit of his every time he visited her.  </p><p>Again and again, he wished to make her into a horcrux. He had to remind himself that he would one day bind their souls together. Her thoughts would be his; her memories would be his. He would feel everything she felt. Their magic would meld together. He would truly possess her in every sense of the word.</p><p>According to his study, Hermione had to consent to the soul-bond. </p><p>Tom had decided that she would, and that was that. There was no other option.</p><p>He wondered how it would work with his soul already split? Another thing for him to search out.</p><p>They only failed to see one another when social obligations took precedence, and even then, they often canceled on those.</p><p>There were nights that he would come to her flat without warning.</p><p>If she had guests, as she often did, he said: “Get rid of them,” and walked into the bedroom while she obeyed. He never violated their unspoken agreement to never be seen together. </p><p>Often he walked into her bedroom, which was ice blue and cream and very french. He would throw his work robes over her bed and rip off his shirt and tie, and they would sit and talk for an hour or two, not talking about politics or her articles or his job at Borgin &amp; Burkes. They talked about literature, magic and philosophical concepts. They talked about The Great Gatsby as a zeitgeist of the 20s. They talked of muggle composers. Her favorite, she said, was Chopin. He admitted his favorite to be Rachmaninov, to which she giggled and said, “But, of course he is!” She confronted him with the brilliancy of muggle inventions and how they could be blended with magic to make both the wizarding and muggle worlds better. Tom was a rather brilliant, albeit arrogant debater, but Hermione loved the ways in which he challenged her. </p><p>“Would you teach me some of your magic, Tom?”</p><p>He grinned at her. “Would you like that?”</p><p>“Of course. You are a genius, after all. A magical <em> prodigy </em>, they say.” She fought back an amused smile.</p><p>He leaned in until his lips almost touched hers. “But I thought the dark arts would corrupt the garden of your soul?”</p><p>Hermione swallowed. “Is that all you can do? The <em> dark arts </em>? Are you a one-trick pony, Tom?”</p><p>His black eyes flickered red beneath his lashes as they roamed her face. “I have many, <em> many </em>tricks, little witch. Shall I acquaint you with all of them?”</p><p>“Please,” she breathed.</p><p>Sometimes she sat in the center of her sitting room, watching him as he stood smoking by the floor-to-ceiling windows of her flat, gazing out over the city. She took mental pictures of him, then occluded them away in the far reaches of her mind. She told herself it would be for her to access one day, when she’d killed him. They’d be there for her to remember him by. She wanted to remember him this way, and not as the monster she truly knew him to be.</p><p>The deeper that Riddle sunk his claws into her, wrapping around her like a boa constrictor, the more she abused elixirs. She was sinking, and she knew now that she was addicted to them. She’d taken to brewing them herself, as the various apothecaries she’d purchased them at began to give her strange looks. She knew she should somehow break herself of the habit, but with her demanding career and social obligations, as well as her relationship with Riddle, she hadn’t the time to devote to it.</p><p>In drawing rooms and ballrooms, witches and wizards talked of the intense dislike that Hermione harbored for Tom Riddle. </p><p>“Riddle? You mean that shopboy that Dumbledore’s daughter can’t stand?”</p><p>“If Hermione Dumbledore says he’s no good, then he must be downright awful. She’s the kindest and most accepting person I know!”</p><p>“<em> Merlin </em>, but those two hate each other! I’m not even sure if they’ve ever met!”</p><p>In one gossip magazine, a columnist wrote, “The long standing feud between Malfoys and Weasleys is starting to positively pale in comparison to the ferocity between Riddle and Dumbledore.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p><br/>
Hermione had become so used to his scent that she felt a longing for it in the pit of her stomach when he was away. She enjoyed the absence of it, reveling in the torturous ache. The lack of him throughout the day only made her feel his presence more acutely when he was near. The moment his scent hit her nostrils, it was at first an overwhelming smell of whiskey and smoke, but as she breathed him in more deeply, she would pick up on the finer notes of cedarwood and oud wood, amber, and something harder to identify, an oceanic misty aroma, like rain in the morning. The combination of these scents was heady, leaving Hermione intoxicated and desperate for more of him. It conjured up unbidden images, of night and waterfalls and cold, rocky shores. That was what Tom was to her. A treacherous black ocean lapping at a shore of sharp rocks, beckoning her like a siren’s call. </p><p>Hermione Granger had become hopelessly shipwrecked on the isle of Tom Riddle.</p><p> </p><hr/><p><br/>
Tom awoke in the night to a deep peal of thunder. It rumbled continuously; lightning streaked the sky. His bedroom was pitch black save for the intermittent flashes of lightning.</p><p>He was drawn to the warm body next to his. He slipped his arms around her soft waist, savoring her smooth skin. Tom pressed his face into her hair, inhaling deeply the scent of lavender and vanilla.</p><p>She stirred at his embrace, releasing a soft sigh in her sleep. He nuzzled her hair, his breath tickling her ear. “Hermione.”</p><p>“Mmm,” she hummed, but she didn’t wake. </p><p>He pulled her closer, pressing his naked body against hers as their heated forms melted together beneath the sheets. He pressed his lips to her collarbone. Darkness engulfed them; then, a bright flash of lightning lit the room and he caught a glimpse of her face, serene and peaceful in sleep. He ran his fingertip along her cheek. “Wake, my little witch.”</p><p>His hand trailed down her stomach, seeking out the softness between her legs. He cupped her warmth and slid his finger along her folds, parting them gently. His nose brushed her ear. “Hermione,” he breathed. </p><p>“Tom?” she murmured, her lips barely parted. </p><p>He chuckled under his breath. “Wake up. I’ve got a hunger that only you can satisfy.” </p><p>Lightning lit the sky once more, illuminating her face, and her lips were turned up in the barest hint of a smile. She moaned sleepily, and Tom slid his finger between her folds, then slipped it inside her. </p><p>“Tom,” she whispered, seeking his face with her hands. He met her searching with his lips, pressing them to her mouth hungrily. Hermione moaned and spread her legs, immediately welcoming the heat of his hips between her thighs. His cock was hard as it pressed against her, awakening a pulsing need in her body. </p><p>He suddenly slid away and she whimpered, feeling the loss of his lips on hers. She became more lucid, feeling his hands gripping her knees and his hair brushing her thighs. He pulled her legs apart and suddenly his mouth was devouring her. She gasped at the sudden sensation of his tongue sliding along her entrance and its warmth swirling around her clit. His tongue slid inside her and rolled as his teeth grazed her sensitive flesh, his lips sucking at the pink skin. His nose brushed against her clit. </p><p>“Oh,” she sighed. “Tom, please…”</p><p>“Please, what?” He muttered flatly, his voice hard. </p><p>“Please,” she whispered, searching in the dark for his hard length. Her fingertips touched him, sliding across the veins of his cock, causing Tom to suck in a sharp breath between his teeth.</p><p>He sat up and gripped himself, pressing the head of his cock against her entrance. “Is this what you want, little witch?”</p><p>“Yes,” she whispered. </p><p>“Beg,” he commanded. </p><p>Her heart pounded. “Please, Tom.”</p><p>“Say it.” He pushed himself between her walls slightly, and then pulled back out, eliciting a gasp from her throat. </p><p>“Please, I need you inside me...”</p><p>He slid the head of his cock along her entrance, which was now dripping wet, causing a deep, pleased groan to issue from his chest. Hermione could feel his magic leaching from him, like a dark vapor around her. “You want to be a slut for the Dark Lord, don’t you, Hermione?”</p><p>Her mouth fell open and she gasped. Those particular words coming from his lips, referring to himself as the Dark Lord, struck fear into her heart. It was a tangible fear, an alive thing that dug its claws into her heart. </p><p>She lay her head back and let her eyes fall shut. She banished the fear. “Yes,” she whispered tremulously. </p><p>“Good girl,” he breathed against her skin, his lips brushing lightly against her breast. His tongue swirled around her nipple, and then he blew his breath against it, feeling it harden under the cool air. “Give yourself to me, Hermione. Give yourself to Lord Voldemort.”</p><p>She couldn’t breathe. She felt fingers wrapping around her throat, threatening to choke her, but Tom’s hands were on her waist.  It was his magic that was stealing the air from her lungs. “Tom,” she choked out, grasping at her throat.</p><p>“Don’t panic,” he muttered. “Breathe, little witch.”</p><p>She felt his knuckles brush her cheekbone gently, bringing her back down to center.</p><p>And when she stopped fighting, she found that she could breathe, even with the pressure around her throat.</p><p>She swallowed. Her heart thudded in her chest painfully. Her adrenaline spiked sharply as she sucked in a labored breath. Her vision clouded.</p><p>He filled her in one swift movement, and her mouth fell open at the intense sensation of being stretched. </p><p>“You are so tight, it’s maddening,” he muttered as he pinned her arms above her head. He began to move, thrusting deeply and slowly. </p><p>Suddenly, Hermione was seeing things. Mental images, but they felt so real, as if she were right there, like she’d used a pensieve. Erotic images. Tom stood in the shower naked, holding himself and stroking softly. Hermione knelt before him and he reached out to take a handful of her hair. He presented his cock to her lips and they parted, allowing him to fill her mouth until his head hit the back of her throat. He thrust in and out, fucking her mouth roughly as the water pelted them both.</p><p>The image shifted. Tom had her arms pulled tight above her head and her wrists were bound by some sort of curse. Her legs were spread and he brought her to the edge of release with his tongue again and again, refusing to allow her to finish until she was a sobbing, trembling mess beneath him.</p><p>Hermione came back to herself, the visions suddenly gone. Tom smirked down at her as he thrust hard and deep.</p><p>“Is that… magic?”</p><p>“Mind magic, my little witch.” He leaned down to whisper in her ear. “Thought I’d let you in on my most recent fantasies.”</p><p>Hermione sucked in a breath, feeling an electric current shooting down through her core and straight between her legs. She wanted him to do those things to her. She wanted the blending of the softer Tom and the darker Voldemort. She wanted him to fuck her as both men, even if that made her a traitor, a whore. She wanted the merging of their magic and their bodies and their souls.</p><p>Most of all, she wanted to learn that specific kind of magic he’d just performed.</p><p>Tom was so much more than she had expected. He made her hungry. He possessed something that she desperately needed and couldn’t get enough of.</p><p>Thunder cracked violently.</p><p>“Tom, you..”</p><p>He paused, listening, waiting for her to say what she felt, but she didn’t know what it was that she felt. She’d never felt any of the things she felt for him before. They were new, unheard of things. </p><p>“I need you,” she whispered, for lack of better words. “I want you, Tom.” Her voice fell to a whisper, and Tom barely heard her say, “In my soul.”</p><p>He stared at her for a moment as lightning lit the room. “I know,  Hermione.” He thrust harder, shifting angles and spreading her legs wider to seat himself more deeply inside of her.</p><p>She arched back, feeling release building in her core, a teasing pressure that thrummed, deep and achy. She was always more sensitive when he woke her from her sleep. Tom leaned down and murmured in her ear, “I’m yours. We’re one, Hermione. You can never deny it. We belong to each other.”</p><p>She wanted to deny it, but she couldn’t. His essence was her exact opposite, the foil to her being, and yet, she also felt that he was half of her soul. </p><p>She couldn’t escape him if she wanted to. </p><p>“Say it, Hermione. Say my name.”</p><p>“Tom,” she whispered. In her mind, she heard Voldemort. Part of her expected Death Eaters to appear every time she heard it. It was a deeply ingrained, instinctual fear. </p><p>His teeth sunk into her shoulder. She moaned, then whispered his name again like a prayer. </p><p>She said it in between his thrusts, chanting it as if she were a Gregorian monk. </p><p>The ghostly fingers tightened around her throat and her vision began to blacken. Still, she spared her precious remaining breath to whisper, “Tom.” </p><p>She would say it until her lungs were empty. She wanted to be empty, to be filled with him and only him.</p><p>“You are mine, Hermione.” He thrust harder, faster. A cry escaped her throat as she exploded into euphoria, her walls tightening and convulsing around him. Her vision was black and starless, like his eyes, like the pieces of his soul. Her legs trembled and she moaned as waves of numbing pleasure vibrated through her body. The fingers around her neck relented, and she slowly dragged a breath into her rattling lungs.</p><p>With a final thrust, he seated himself within her to the hilt and hardened, pumping his seed inside her, his arms trembling and elbows locked as he held himself above her. “Fuck,” he growled. He entered her a few more times, slowly, gently, before he withdrew. “I love the sound you make when you come.”</p><p>Suddenly, Hermione felt three words on the tip of her tongue and they terrified her.</p><p>How had this happened?</p><p>She vowed to herself that she would never say them. </p><p>For to say them would surely be the blade which permanently severed this life from her old one. </p><p>If she said them, then everything she had ever known and believed about her life would be turned inside out. When had her life become so complicated?</p><p>If she said them, she would never be able to destroy him and his horcruxes.</p><p>And to do that, Hermione felt, was the only redemption she had left. Every compromise she had made, the fact that she was here, in Lord Voldemort’s bed… it could all be undone if she killed him.</p><p>Then she could forgive herself.</p><p>Could she? She didn’t know anymore. But she knew one thing with certainty… Voldemort could not be allowed to live. No matter what she felt.</p><p>No matter what they were to each other.</p><p>She was quiet as she heard him take his wand from the nightstand. He paused, and she could hear his heavy breathing in the darkness. Then, he cast a contraception charm on her.</p><p>He collapsed on top of her and laid his head between her breasts, wrapping both of his hands around her wrists, and they fell asleep.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p><br/>
“There’s many branches of magic that I would like to teach you, Hermione. Are there any particular kinds of magic which you are hungry to learn?”</p><p>Hermione stood with Albus that Sunday in the dueling room at Hogwarts. They had enjoyed tea with Piksy and Lucky, and she had caught Dumbledore up on her work accomplishments, asking his advice about her articles and her proposal drafts for the next quarterly convening of the ICW.</p><p>“Well,” she said quietly. “I was a bit curious about… mind magic.”</p><p>“Ah, yes. Where did you learn of it?”</p><p>She swallowed and averted her eyes. “I merely came across it in some of my reading recently.”</p><p>Albus smiled. “I would be more than happy to teach you, my dear. There are many kinds of mind magic, but there are three primary spells which I consider to be very advanced.”</p><p>“Is the <em> imperius </em> considered mind magic? <em> Confundus </em>?”</p><p>Albus tilted his head. “They are, to some degree, but I do not consider them to be advanced. Let’s see. The first is called <em> The Mirage Charm </em> . This spell has two functions. One can cast it directly onto another person, or one can cast it onto themselves and anyone in the vicinity of the caster. This spell creates an illusion; it can cause one to see with the physical eye <em> anything </em>which one desires. It is an illusion of the mind, which befuddles the senses.”</p><p>In a blink, Hermione was no longer in the dueling hall at Hogwarts, but she and Albus were standing in the sitting room of his cottage in Godric’s Hollow. Everything around her looked entirely real. Suddenly, there was a high-pitched whistle issuing from the kitchen. </p><p>Albus held up a finger and turned his head, then smiled. “Would you care for some tea?”</p><p>Hermione’s brows drew forward. “You- you can actually make tea and drink it? All within this illusion?”</p><p>Albus nodded. “Of course. As long as it is something that you have experienced so acutely that you can bring it to remembrance in great detail, you can use it to ensnare the senses of any hapless witch or wizard.” He left and returned with a pot of tea, which he then poured into two teacups. Hermione put sugar in hers and brought it to her lips. It was a robust, toasty black tea. The flavor spilled over her tongue. It was so incredibly <em> real</em>.</p><p>“How remarkable,” she marveled.</p><p>Albus smiled. “If you wanted to confuse another witch or wizard while dueling, simply cast them alone into an illusion.”</p><p>Suddenly, the room disappeared and so did the cup in her hand. They were back in the dueling hall.</p><p>“Is it very hard?”</p><p>He inclined his head. “It depends on how vivid your imagination is. Wave your wand like so.” He showed her the wand movement. “The incantation is <em> Hallucidorus</em>. To cast it on the entire room, yourself included, say, <em> Hallucidorus Totalus</em>. It is possible to cast it wandlessly, and even without uttering the incantation, but that is extremely advanced. Start simple.” Albus waved his wand, conjuring a book out of thin air. “This book will explain to you the subtleties and nuances of the spell. Do practice it at home and we will try it next week. Now, for the second spell: the <em> Dream Weaver.”</em></p><p>Hermione’s eyebrows rose. “That sounds quite mysterious.”</p><p>Albus chuckled. “It is a rather mystifying spell, and can be imprecise if not done properly. There are two forms of this spell. The first will draw forth dreams from the target’s subconscious, and cause them to relive them. If the caster is very skilled, they can choose which dreams the target relives, or they can even alter those dreams. The incantation is <em> Phantasmagoria </em> . The second function of the spell will allow the caster to enter into the dreams of the target, essentially injecting themselves into a person’s dreams. The incantation is <em> Phantasmatum </em>. You will find it in that book as well. I adjure you to study them well, before we practice them.”</p><p>Hermione’s eyes were wide as saucers. “These almost seem like dark arts.”</p><p>Albus seemed thoughtful. “They most certainly could be used in that manner, as is the case with many spells.”</p><p>Hermione was already flipping through the pages of the book. “What is the third spell?”</p><p>Albus made his way over to where Hermione stood. He waved his wand and the book suddenly flipped open to a particular page. There, on the page was an illustration of a beautiful witch, lying asleep. “You grew up in a muggle home, Hermione. Were you ever read muggle fairytales as a child?”</p><p>“Certainly.”</p><p>“There are references to this curse in several muggle fairytales. Sleeping Beauty, I believe it’s called. The other, Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, referred to it as the <em> Sleeping Death</em>.” He chuckled. “Although true love’s kiss is <em> certainly </em>not the countercurse.”</p><p>“It sounds terrifying.”</p><p>“It is not quite as frightening as it sounds, but it is powerful. It is called <em> Enchanted Slumber</em>. You may also hear it referred to as <em> Gormlaith Gaunt’s curse</em>, as I believe she was the first ever recorded to cast it in 1634 when she attacked her niece Isolt at Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Although, the spell is quite ancient, beyond her use of the spell.”</p><p>“Gaunt,” Hermione gulped.</p><p>“Yes, descendents of Salazar Slytherin. Quite staunch blood purists. It is quite a fascinating story, about Isolt Sayre and Gormlaith Gaunt. You may want to read about it in your spare time.”</p><p>“Certainly. I shall.”</p><p>“In any case, the incantation is <em> Morphibulus.</em>” He showed her the flourish of the wand movement. “It casts the target into a deep, enchanted slumber, from which there is almost no waking. However, supposedly, the scent of Amortentia has the ability to wake the sleeper from the curse… which is probably what lent to the myth that true love’s kiss was the counter. It is a romanticized notion that is quite typical of muggle literature.”</p><p>Albus instructed her on the various mental techniques to utilizing the spells, and then they ended their lesson, as it was getting quite late already. </p><p>As Hermione loaded up a stack of several books and put them gingerly in her beaded bag, she began to feel a bit guilty that Albus didn’t know about her relationship with Riddle. She didn’t think it wise to tell him, but she also didn’t feel good about withholding it. </p><p>“Albus,” Hermione began soberly. “Can I ask you something?”</p><p>“Certainly, child.”</p><p>Hermione was quiet for a moment as she collected her thoughts. “Do you think that someone can change?”</p><p>Dumbledore tilted his head, considering. “Change?”</p><p>“Yes… If someone was… let’s say, not such a good person. Do you think they could ever change?”</p><p>He thought for a moment, his eyes trained on her. “It is possible. Anything is possible, Hermione. Why do you ask?”</p><p>“Well… how would you know? If someone could change?”</p><p>His blue eyes followed her as she walked across the room. “If a person wants to change, Hermione, then usually, they do. However, change is not possible for someone who does not <em> desire </em> to change.”</p><p>Hermione nodded. “Right. Yes, of course.”</p><p>Silence stretched in the room for several minutes. </p><p>“Do you think that someone would want to change, for someone else? Or… could they be convinced… that they were wrong in their beliefs, or actions?”</p><p>“Hermione,” Dumbledore interrupted. “Who are we speaking about?”</p><p>“No one,” she said quickly. “Just… it’s all hypothetical.”</p><p>“I see,” he nodded, looking at her through his spectacles. “Well, the easiest way to know if someone wants to change, is to stand back and watch what they do.”</p><p>Hermione swallowed. Then, she nodded. “Right.”</p><p>Albus gazed at her solemnly. “Unfortunately, the gossip tabloids even seem to make their way to my desk at times. I have caught wind of your breakup with Alphard Black. Is this true?”</p><p>She glanced at him, then looked down at her hands absentmindedly. “Yes, it’s true.” After a moment, she looked back at him, as if to coax out his thoughts. </p><p>He smiled. “Well, he, despite his house affiliations, was always a pleasant lad. Never got into any trouble really. He seemed to be a well-liked, congenial sort of boy. Not the sort of family who would be supportive of your career, mind you, but I wouldn’t hold it against him.”</p><p>“Yes, he was always very good to me. I have nothing but affection for him.”</p><p>He watched Hermione closely. “May I ask why the sudden end to your courtship?”</p><p>Hermione looked at her hands and sighed. “It’s complicated, Albus.”</p><p>Albus picked up a book, pretending to flip through it. “There is someone else, then, isn’t there?”</p><p>Hermione grew very quiet as she stared at the floor.</p><p>Albus snapped the book shut. “Who is it, Hermione?”</p><p>Her head lifted, and then slowly, her eyes found Albus’. They gazed at one another for a moment, before she swallowed, then lowered her eyes to the floor. “Tom Riddle.”</p><p>Dumbledore’s blue eyes sharpened like a hawk’s. </p><p>One could’ve heard a pindrop.</p><p>Silence stretched between them.</p><p>Hermione thought it grew colder in the room. </p><p>She looked back at Albus, and her expression was serious and grave.</p><p>Albus finally blinked away. “I would venture to say what I’m thinking, however, from the look on your <em> own </em> face, I don’t gather that it needs saying, nor will it fall on welcome ears.”</p><p>“I always welcome what you have to say, Albus.”</p><p>“There’s a difference in listening and <em> taking heed</em>, Hermione.”</p><p>She smiled wryly. “I don’t think there’s anything you could tell me that I don’t already know.”</p><p>Dumbledore watched her searchingly. Then, he sighed. “Riddle was always quite popular with the girls during his time at this school. He was quite popular with everyone, really. Teachers and students, alike.”</p><p>She gave a breathy laugh. “I would say that this is <em> different </em>than that, but I suppose I run the risk of sounding like everyone else.”</p><p>He gazed at her. “On the contrary, Hermione. I can see Riddle being interested in you. I sometimes feel that I know the boy quite well; and then, other times, I feel that I don’t know him at all. But from what I do know of him, I can certainly see Riddle being intrigued with you. But what I find surprising is <em> your </em>interest in Riddle, of all people.”</p><p>“I have to agree,” she mumbled quietly. “I’m quite surprised, myself.”</p><p>“Hmm.” Dumbledore gazed down at the cover of the book he held. His countenance was quite troubled, and he did not try to hide it. “Would you consider this a passing romance? An infatuation? Or something… more serious?”</p><p>Hermione was quiet for several moments. “I… don’t see how it could be anything other than passing. But, then again… it feels… intense, Albus. It feels as if… our souls are connected. It feels as though… I could <em> break </em> him, and he could break <em> me</em>.”</p><p>Dumbledore gazed at her with fear in his eyes. “I know that feeling well, Hermione. I’m afraid that in those types of situations, almost always, one <em> will </em> break the other.”</p><p>Hermione nodded, her eyes sad and faraway.</p><p>Albus sighed. “I told myself that I would never ask you this question. But given the circumstances, I find it permissive… or rather, <em> imperative </em> that I do ask it now.”</p><p>Hermione turned to look up at Albus and their eyes met. She knew what he was going to ask before the words left his lips.</p><p>“I must ask it, Hermione. Is Riddle the Dark Lord from the future?”</p><p>Her lips parted. Her breath felt very heavy in her lungs.</p><p>Silence ensued.</p><p>Albus sighed and nodded, then his eyelids fell shut over his blue eyes. His expression was pained.</p><p>“When will you see him again?”</p><p>Hermione blinked. “I see him every night, Albus.”</p><p>He didn’t open his eyes. “And do you stay with him?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Albus nodded. Then, he smiled. It was a sad, regretful smile. “Well, Hermione. If anyone knows what it feels like to love a Dark Lord, it’s me. I pray you don’t end up at the tip of each other’s wand.”</p><p>At that, Albus laid his hand on Hermione’s shoulder and squeezed it gently. Then, he left.</p><p> </p><p><br/>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Tom Riddle sat in his bed with a cigarette lit, his books spread out chaotically across his bed. His little witch was at a ministry event tonight pertaining to the upcoming election, one which he had also been invited to, but he’d declined in favor of studying on a topic that was particularly pressing to Tom. He knew that Hermione had to be occupied tonight, so he’d chosen this specific night to spend researching. Hermione often wanted to know what he was studying, and this topic especially was something he would rather not divulge to her at the present time, given that she was so averse to the dark arts.</p><p>He combed his history books and biographies, searching for hints of the whereabouts of the burial sites of various ancient dark wizards. He scanned his books for information about Raczidian, a medieval dark wizard who dwelled in a castle co-inhabited by dementors. Raczidian died by attempting the patronus charm; wizards who were defiled by dark magic and impure motives could only conjure death when attempting the patronus charm. Maggots had burst from his wand and consumed him. That was another reason Tom had not attempted to conjure the Patronus charm again. He didn’t desire to meet the same end. Unfortunately, in this particular book, there was no hint to the whereabouts of his bones.</p><p>He read about Morgan le Fay, a powerful medieval witch and the enemy of Merlin. He combed through histories on Merwyn the Malicious, Emeric the Evil, Ekrizdis, and Ethelred the Ever-Ready. Tom had already located the resting place of Gormlaith Gaunt, the aunt of Isolt Sayre, founder of Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Gormlaith happened to be a distant relative of Tom’s, also a descendent of Salazar Slytherin, born into the Irish branch of the family. She had possessed Slytherin’s wand during her lifetime, but after her death in 1634, the wand was deactivated and buried, and grew into a snakewood tree on the grounds of Ilvermorny. Tom planned to go there and seek out her bones, as well as take some wood from the snakewood tree, which he would keep and perhaps make into a wand at some point. It was said to contain medicinal properties. Perhaps he would make it into a horcrux. Gormlaith was known as an exceptionally powerful witch, albeit rather mad and an unfaltering blood purist. Madness tended to run in the Gaunt bloodline, unfortunately.</p><p>Tom read briefly about the murder of Barnabas Deverill by Loxias, who subsequently became the owner of a wand made of Elder, aptly named “the Deathstick.” Tom was rather fascinated by these wands of great power, but he tended not to believe that a wand itself could make a wizard invincible. Obviously, that was not true, because many of the owners of such wands were murdered in order to gain ownership of the wand. Tom believed more in the witch or wizard’s own abilities, rather than reliance on a wand. However, he did contemplate the effects of such a wand in say, <em> his </em>hand, for example, or in the hand of any other powerful wizard of similar abilities. He made a mental note to study more about these wands later.</p><p>At the present time, he was preoccupied with one wizard in particular: Herpo the Foul.</p><p>Herpo was one of the earliest known dark wizards, hailing from Ancient Greece. He was a wizard who’d invented many dark curses, as well as, more notably, being the wizard who’d made the first ever <em> horcrux </em>. He’d seemingly invented them, or rather, he’d been the first to uncover the magic that made them after studying the soul and the effects of murder upon it. He was also a Parselmouth, and he had created and bred the first known Basilisk, which was now an XXXXX-classified creature, as only Parselmouths were said to be able to tame them.</p><p>It was widely believed that Salazar Slytherin, due to his ability to speak Parseltongue, was a descendant of Herpo the Foul, which, by extension, made Tom also his descendent.</p><p>Tom was the only person who knew of the existence of Salazar’s basilisk in the chamber of secrets, and so that detail alone gave credence to the theory.</p><p>Tom considered Herpo to be the father of modern dark wizardry, and he salivated at the idea of unearthing his bones and absorbing the ancient dark magic encased in them. It was just too damn tempting. He imagined that particular wizard’s magic would feel at home within Tom, who was also a Parselmouth with a pet basilisk and a couple horcruxes lying around.</p><p>Tom felt nauseous with the hunger for that power.</p><p>He had been itching to research it ever since he’d learned of the ritual from Grindelwald’s mind. But he hadn’t wanted Hermione to know. He didn’t want to think what her reaction would be if she found out what he was planning. In essence, what she didn’t know wouldn’t hurt her.</p><p>If she could have secrets, then he was entitled to them as well.</p><p>He could start with tracing the Gaunt family lineage. He could see if there were any relatives who would know anything about Herpo, but Tom wasn’t hopeful. He knew it was highly unlikely. </p><p>There was also the possibility that Herpo wasn’t truly dead. He had created a horcrux, after all, although there was still a danger with horcruxes which had driven Tom to create his tempaestus as well.</p><p>If Tom were to be killed, he would essentially be a wandering soul. His horcruxes provided a flawed kind of immortality, because they ensured that his soul could not be sent to the afterlife. This was why Tom intended to create seven of them. However, his remaining soul, or a piece of soul housed in one of his horcruxes, would have to be rehoused inside a physical body using dark magic. </p><p>This brought his servants’ loyalty into question. Who could Tom trust to not only keep his horcruxes safe, but to return Tom to power were he to be killed? Who could he trust with his tempaestus?</p><p>He didn’t want his followers to know about the import of the objects and their magic, but he also couldn’t expect them to perform the rituals <em> without </em>that knowledge.</p><p>Tom leaned back against the headboard and lit another cigarette. </p><p>Suppose Herpo’s body had been killed. Did he still have a horcrux in existence somewhere? Was his soul wandering the world, without the power or ability to become corporeal? </p><p>If the same fate were to happen to Tom, would Tom be able to use the body of darkness to make his soul corporeal? Or did it only work when astral projecting from a living body?</p><p>Tom sighed. These were the maddening questions that he supposed came with the territory. Very few wizards delved into such obscure and theoretical feats of magic. Many had studied them, but few had been bold enough to execute them. He would be one of, if not <em> the first </em> to discover the inner workings and mechanics of these magical methods.</p><p>He thanked his lucky stars that at least Herpo had paved the way for Tom, albeit a rough way, though it was. Tom preened at the thought that he was related to this ingenious dark wizard. He decided that it almost made up for his unfortunate muggle heritage.</p><p>But not quite.</p><p>Regardless of whether Herpo’s soul still roamed the universe, it was unlikely that he was still alive physically. Tom didn’t actually know whether creating a horcrux would preserve his physical body from decay. These were uncharted waters; there were no published studies or any real research conducted on horcruxes, due to the nature of their magic. Murder was <em> taboo </em> in the wizarding world; how sad. Some people <em> deserved </em>to die. Like that muggle politician who raped orphans. Tom still cheerily thought about his soul rotting in some hellish afterlife.</p><p>In his mind, his father had deserved to die. He’d abandoned his only child to an orphanage. Tom had no feelings where his father was concerned. His hatred had ceased to exist when he saw the light leave the man’s eyes. Tom felt that justice had been served. A book had been closed.</p><p>But Herpo was Tom’s <em> true </em>father… the father of Tom’s magic, of his basilisk, of his horcruxes, of his parselmouth. The father of one of the greatest wizards to walk the earth: Salazar Slytherin.</p><p>They would one day say such things about Lord Voldemort.</p><p>Tom intended to discover where his bones lay. There had to be <em> someone </em>who knew. Some ancient, pureblooded Greek family whose ancestors had passed down the knowledge. </p><p>Tom didn’t care how long it took him. He would find out.</p><p>Tom also considered the possibility of searching for Herpo’s horcrux. Did he want to bring the wizard back using a piece of his soul? It was tempting.</p><p>But that was a decision for another day.</p><p>Tom glanced at his pocket watch. Hermione would likely show up soon, dolled up and wearing some sleek gown which he would promptly rip off of her. He could see her with her long silk gloves and smoothed curls, his necklace around her neck like a leash, lipstick just begging to be smeared. She was on the arm of Aeris Flint tonight.</p><p>Tom smirked to himself as he breathed smoke into his lungs. He liked to see her with these other wizards, simply because he knew that she wore them like accessories. He liked to think about her walking into parties on the arm of Sebastian Runcorn or Percival Evermonde or Abraxas Malfoy. He thought of it as he kissed her, as he drove himself into her. It gave him great pleasure that she was his and no one else’s.</p><p>It was the most preeminent and supreme pleasure he’d ever experienced.</p><p>Tom heard a knock on the door of his flat, so he flicked his wand, banishing the books to his shelf and went to let her in.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<em> Hermione, </em>
</p><p>
<em> I imagine you are currently at work, thinking of all the ways you might destroy me, like the heartless little witch that you are. </em>
</p><p>
<em> I will be in France on Sunday. I won’t return until Monday morning. </em>
</p><p>
<em> I have altered the wards on my flat to allow you to apparate in, should you desire to sleep there in my absence. If so, I will see you there on Monday morning. </em>
</p><p>
<em> As to your inquiry, I have a rare alchemy book which does discuss the quest for panacea. It disproves your rather ill-informed opinions on the Elixir of Life. I will leave it for you to examine in your spare time. I will accept your humble apology for questioning my intellectual superiority on the subject of alchemy. Scones are an acceptable offering of penance. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Please behave in my absence, if you are at all capable of such a thing. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Eternally, </em>
</p><p>
<em> TMR </em>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Tom and Reinhard Lestrange apparated onto a bridge in the French countryside near Chinon. </p><p>Reinhard immediately bent over and hurled violently over the stone wall into the Vienne river.</p><p>“Bloody hell, Tom,” he coughed, then proceeded to vomit again.</p><p>Tom reached into his robes and produced a pack of cigarettes, from which he drew one and lit it. He inhaled as he waited patiently for his comrade to finish emptying his stomach of its contents.</p><p>“Bloody hell, is that how you’ve been getting around so quickly?”</p><p>“Here,” Tom muttered, handing Reinhard a vial of potion. “It will help with the effects of the apparation.”</p><p>Lestrange was bent over, quite dizzy and breathing heavily, but he took the potion. “You don’t need one?”</p><p>Tom shook his head. “Not anymore.”</p><p>“Bloody hell.”</p><p>“Would you kindly shut up?” Tom spat. “Hurry and drink it.”</p><p>His companion threw back the vial. After a moment, he stood up a bit straighter, wiping sweat from his brow. </p><p>“Can you walk? Let’s go.”</p><p>Lestrange followed Tom as he made his way briskly down the length of the bridge.<br/><br/><br/></p><hr/><p> </p><p>Several hours later, Tom and Lestrange stood in the great library at Lestrange Manor. The manor was arguably even more opulent than Malfoy Manor, and gave every impression of the palace of Versailles. The Lestranges were the owners and keepers of the largest, most detailed, and most exhaustive collection of genealogical records in existence. There were scrolls and scrolls of pureblood family trees and individual biographies. </p><p>Tom was the last descendent that had a right to bear the Gaunt name. He had framed his uncle for the death of his father and grandparents, and his uncle had passed away in Azkaban, leaving Tom as the last of their legacy.</p><p>However, he still had distant relatives on the American side of the family, descendents of Rionach Gaunt and William Sayre. His last living relatives belonged to the Boot family.</p><p>Every genealogical archive Tom had accessed previously had only reached as far back as Salazar Slytherin. Any records prior to that seemed to have been destroyed. There was also no record of Salazar ever having a wife, although he did sire offspring.</p><p>Tom spent several hours searching, but he finally found the scrolls he was looking for. The genealogies of the Boot family and the family tree of a very well-known group of Grecian purebloods, the Argyris family. They were well-known internationally for being magical historians and keepers of ancient artifacts. They even had an expansive tomb for famous Greek wizards. If anyone would know where Herpo was buried, it would be that family. </p><p>Tom cast duplication charms on the scrolls and tucked them in his robes. </p><p>“Come, Lestrange. Now we go to Greece.”</p><p>“Merlin, Tom, you can’t be serious? After how far we just came? We’ll be splinched.”</p><p>Tom took a deep breath and turned tacitly to Reinhard. “I had assumed that by now you would have learned not to question me.”</p><p>Lestrange swallowed, lowered his eyes, and then nodded. “Yes, my Lord.”</p><p>Tom and Reinhard had tea with the lady of the Manor, Lestrange’s cousin, Sidonie. Once they had spent the proper amount of time on pleasantries, they apparated to Greece.<br/><br/></p><hr/><p><br/>Hermione laid in Tom’s bed in a short black nightgown. She curled up beneath the blanket and cast a warming charm on herself. It was almost November, and there was a definite chill in the air. She had tried to go to sleep in her own bed, but had ended up apparating to Tom’s flat in the end. Tom knew her far too well. She wasn’t used to sleeping alone anymore, and it comforted her to be in his bed when he was gone. It smelled of his intoxicatingly masculine scent, and she liked to see his obsessively well-folded clothes, already sitting on the chair, laid out for work the next day. He never forgot things like that, and she found it oddly soothing.</p><p>She had spent time with Dumbledore today and had successfully mastered the mind magic spells he had taught her. Then Hermione had spent the remainder of the day with Piksy in Diagon Alley, buying her ice cream and visiting various shops with her, as the elf was missing her terribly of late with as much time as Hermione spent at Tom’s flat. However, the elf had become best friends with Dumbledore’s house elf, Lucky, and the two spent quite a bit of time together when they were not working.</p><p>Hermione laid awake in his bed; it felt strange not to have Tom there. She thought of what he might be doing in France. She hoped he wasn’t searching for items to make into horcruxes.</p><p>It bothered her that he didn’t seem inclined to tell her about his plans, but Hermione knew it was because she withheld the truth from him. It wasn’t as if he was vindictive about it; it was simply his own rule. She noticed that Tom formulated his own rules which he set for himself, and he was very adamantly strict about following them. “A secret for a secret,” he would always say to her with a smirk.</p><p>Hermione had combed his entire flat looking for the diary. She hadn’t been able to find it, although she had found a bottle of slytherin green liquid which was labeled Absinthe and tasted like gasoline. She drank one sip and nearly heaved up her dinner. She thought it quite typical of Tom to have an affinity for a liquor like that.</p><p>As for the horcruxes, she thought it would be too obvious if she stole the ring. He <em> always </em>wore it. He nearly never took it off.</p><p>If she did find the diary, she would have to kill the basilisk in order to destroy it. </p><p>As for the ring, perhaps she could convince him to give it to her. She began to hatch a plan.</p><p>She swallowed. The thought of Tom not existing made her stomach turn. The thought of not being able to lay in his bed and breathe in his scent made her chest ache.</p><p>But this wasn’t about her. There were countless lives to be saved if she killed him. She had to think about that reality, and not her own selfish feelings.</p><p>As she laid in bed, drowning in her thoughts and emotions, she heard a rap on the window pane. Hermione’s brow furrowed. It was rather late; Tom didn’t usually receive post at night. </p><p>She went to the window and caught sight of a small, charcoal grey owl sitting on the sill. She cracked the window and took the letter from its beak. The chilly air caused goosebumps to rise on her skin.</p><p>It was a small note, with elaborately scrawled handwriting. </p><p>
<em> If you happen to find what you are seeking, we will gather at the rendezvous point this Saturday evening. </em>
</p><p>The handwriting looked familiar, and she had a sneaking suspicion that it belonged to Abraxas Malfoy.</p><p>She took a parchment from Riddle’s desk and wrote back, taking great pains to emulate Tom’s spiky penmanship.</p><p>
<em> Which rendezvous point? </em>
</p><p>She knew it was risky, as Tom would likely have been the one to name the place, but she hoped that Malfoy was thick enough to let it slide and not think too deeply into it.</p><p>An hour later, as Hermione laid in bed, trying to sleep, the owl rapped on the window again.</p><p>Hermione unfolded the parchment.</p><p>
<em> Riddle House, of course, as you stated Thursday. Was I somehow mistaken? </em>
</p><p>Hermione quickly penned a response.</p><p>
<em> No, you were correct. I will owl and confirm later. </em>
</p><p>Hermione hoped that she wouldn’t be caught meddling, but she desperately wanted to know what nefarious dealings Tom and his Death Eaters would be up to at Riddle House on Saturday. She simply <em> had </em>to know. </p><p>She decided she would go. Months ago, to her horror, she had discovered she still had Harry’s invisibility cloak packed away in her beaded bag from when they’d been on the run during the war. She felt terrible that he would never get it back, but she decided that if she put it to good use, that would make her feel better about having it. </p><p>With a plan in mind, Hermione buried her face into Tom’s pillow. She didn’t miss the irony of happily inhaling his scent while plotting to kill him.</p>

<em> They slipped briskly into an intimacy from which they never recovered. - F. Scott Fitzgerald </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Tom couldn’t believe his luck. It was as if the universe was conspiring to help him achieve his goals. The Boot family had been a dead end, but the Agyris purebloods had welcomed him as the heir of Slytherin, and politely answered his inquiries.</p><p>“But of course Herpo was preserved,” said Adamantia Agyris. “If I recall correctly, he passed away during the Archaic period, and was buried for centuries in his tomb. Well, he wasn’t actually buried per sè, but was cremated in the ancient Athenian style, and his ashes placed in an urn and concealed in his tomb, here in Athens. We still have an ancient scroll detailing his Prothesis ceremony. The Greeks believed this ceremony was necessary to usher the soul into the afterlife, although we cannot be certain what truly became of Herpo’s soul, after all.”</p><p>“Who buried him?” Tom asked.</p><p>Adamantia gave a grim smile. “His enemies. He had no protégé, for he did not desire to bequeath his magical knowledge to any living witch or wizard, for fear that they would turn against him. He was quite mad, the legends say. It was the splitting of his soul which caused madness to overtake him. His children despised him when they discovered what he had done. They refused to attend his Prothesis, sadly. His enemies conducted the ceremony as a mockery, since it was unlikely that his soul would ever advance onto the afterlife.”</p><p>“How do you know all of this?” asked Tom, his pulse racing.</p><p>“Our family is one of the oldest in Greece, dating back to ancient Mycenae. We can even trace our line back to the witch Circe. We are historians, Mr. Riddle. We have preserved the ancient magical scrolls for millennia. Our trove of history is priceless. We possess the most extensive magical libraries that have ever existed since the library at Alexandria burned.”</p><p>“It’s quite impressive,” Riddle replied, resorting to flattery. “I would love to visit them at a later date. I admit I find myself honored to be enlightened on the topic by a witch of such illustrious lineage.”</p><p>She smiled, her eyes glittering. “I am honored in return, to meet the last heir of Salazar Slytherin. He was a descendant of Herpo, I’m told.”</p><p>“It is very likely,” Tom mused. “Where is the burial site of Herpo located?”</p><p>She made a face. “Well, the burial site was disturbed in the late 1800s. The International Confederation of Wizards determined that the wards on the tomb were insufficient and demanded that his ashes be turned over to the British Historical Society of Magic for safekeeping. They were under the impression that there might be witches or wizards who would desire to use his ashes for some ritual of dark magic.”</p><p>“How silly,” Tom smiled.</p><p>“Indeed,” she laughed. “In any case, his urn is kept by the Historical Society now, in London.”</p><p>“I truly appreciate your meeting with me. I had longed to visit his tomb, as I am quite likely an ancestor of his. However, it seems that is, unfortunately, impossible, so I will take my leave.”</p><p>She looked disappointed. “Will you not stay a bit longer? I could show you the city and introduce you around in my circles.”</p><p>He grinned, flashing his dazzlingly white teeth. “I would certainly love that, but I unfortunately have to be back in London soon. I do appreciate the offer.”</p><p>They both stood, and she held out her hand. “I wish you the best of luck then, Mr. Riddle. If you are ever back in Greece, please do come and pay me a visit.”</p><p>“I certainly will.” Tom reached out and took her hand, then gripped it firmly and yanked her forward, eliciting a gasp from her throat. In the same instant, he withdrew his wand and placed it at her temple. “Obliviate.”<br/><br/></p><hr/><p> </p><p>On Monday morning, Hermione woke to the sound of water running. She rose out of bed slowly and walked to the bathroom. The door was ajar and she pushed it open. </p><p>Tom was back and he was showering in the bathroom, as if he had never left.</p><p>Hermione couldn’t help the smile from spreading across her face. Something about waking up with him here felt like Christmas morning.</p><p>She slipped out of her nightgown and made her way toward the sound of the water. She pushed the curtain aside and found him standing beneath the spray, naked, the water falling in rivulets down his body. </p><p>He looked up and shook the water from his hair. He grinned as his eyes met hers, then they flicked downward over her body.</p><p>“Well, don’t just stand there, witch. Come here.”</p><p>Hermione stepped into the shower and slid her arms around his neck. His arms encircled her waist and he leaned down to press his lips to hers. Her heart immediately beat faster, and she marveled at the effect that even one night apart had upon her emotions. He pressed her against the tile as his hands slid around to grip her hips, his tongue teasing hers playfully. The hot water pelted them, but Hermione didn’t notice anything except Riddle’s skin against hers. His fingers slid into her curls and gripped them tightly, pulling her head back, his lips leaving hers to wander her throat. </p><p>“Did you miss me, little witch?”</p><p>“Yes,” she breathed as his teeth grazed her throat.</p><p>“The feeling is mutual.” His hands were everywhere, stroking her wet skin. “You are an absolute goddess, Dumbledore.”</p><p>Her eyebrows lifted and she leaned back to look at him. She could never decipher his mood, but she noticed there was a tenderness about him this morning that she was not used to.</p><p>“Allow me to worship you,” he murmured. Then, he sank to his knees.</p><p>She gasped as he gripped her thighs and hoisted her onto his shoulders. Then, he buried his tongue inside her.</p><p>“Oh, Merlin,” she moaned.</p><p>He chuckled, and she shivered at the sensation of his hot breath as he muttered, “The only name you’d better be moaning is mine, Hermione.”</p><p>She threaded her fingers in his inky black hair. She was much more sensitive in the morning, and his touch merged with her nerve endings, setting them alight with a blazing synergy. </p><p>Hermione decided to do something that she had been aching to do since the night of the storm. She whispered the incantation, “<em> Hallucidorus Totalus </em>,” and suddenly she and Riddle were in another place entirely.</p><p>They were in a hot springs pool within a cave. To her right, a massive waterfall was falling, its foam spreading out through the rippling water. Hermione was pressed against the wall of the cave, her calves dangling over Riddle’s shoulders with her feet dipping into the water.</p><p>Tom disengaged and looked around him. Then, he leaned back and dropped her into the water. “<em> Impressive </em>, Hermione.”</p><p>She slid her arms around his neck. He leaned in and kissed her, and she tasted herself on his lips. This was not his typical kiss, which was hungry and soul-rending and <em> powerful </em>. This kiss was slow and languid, his tongue teasing her, even a bit playful. She felt his lips smiling against hers. His teeth tugged at her lower lip, and she flicked her eyes to his. They were blazing with unusual intensity, and once she locked into his stare, she was unable to look away. He pressed her against the wall of the cave and his knee moved between her legs. He hooked his hands around her knees and rocked her against him, allowing her to ride up against his thigh, creating a maddening friction.</p><p>“Oh, fuck,” she whispered, letting her head fall over his shoulder. </p><p>He moved her so that she was grinding against his knee.“That’s it, baby.”</p><p>He had never called her that before, and she was surprised at how the endearment sent a jolt right down her core, simply because she wasn’t used to hearing it from him. Her body was on fire, heat flooding between her legs. His leg grew slick with her arousal as he moved her against him beneath the water, the friction against her clit building into a throbbing ache. </p><p>“Oh, god, Tom,” she moaned. “I’m going to come.”</p><p>“Let me hear you,” he whispered, pressing his lips to her shoulder. He pushed her back against the wall of the cave and wrapped his long slender fingers around her throat, directing her to lift her face with his thumb under her chin. “Be a good girl. Eyes on me.”</p><p>Their eyes met, and his black irises enveloped her, piercing and cosmic, his magic wrapping around her like a comforting cloak of darkness. “Tom,” she whispered.</p><p>“What, baby?” He murmured, voice thick with desire.</p><p>“Shit,” she breathed, forgetting what she’d meant to say. Hearing those words from his lips as he stared into her eyes; it did something powerful to her body. This Tom was so different from the wizard she was used to. She craved all of the different versions of him, but this one cut into her so deeply that it was almost unbearable.</p><p>She rolled her hips, grinding against his thigh. She felt herself on the edge of falling. His long fingers rested against her throat and she felt the cold metal of his ring against her skin; he didn’t tighten his hold, but merely let his hand rest there in light pressure, like a necklace.</p><p>Her eyes fell shut. </p><p>He squeezed her throat gently.</p><p>“Eyes on me,” he said sternly. </p><p>Her eyes snapped open and locked with his. “There she is,” he whispered as his thumb stroked her pulse point gently. “Say you’re mine, Hermione”</p><p>“I’m yours,” she moaned. It was the one thing he always instructed her to say, as if each time she said it, it made it more true.</p><p>“Tell me you’re mine forever.”</p><p>She swallowed, but her eyes never broke away from his. They were like knives of obsidian, lit with flames, slicing her open and branding her with otherworldly fire. “Say it, Hermione. Promise me.” He wasn’t commanding her. Instead, he said it softly, his lips so close to hers that their breaths mingled. “You’re mine, forever.”</p><p>Hermione felt like she was in a dream. Perhaps she was. Perhaps she would wake up and be back in her parents’ home. She decided she had to be dreaming, because this man before her was nothing like the Voldemort she knew. He was nothing more than a beautiful dream. She ground her hips against him as she moaned breathlessly, “Yes. Forever.” <em>At least until I kill you</em>, she thought sadly. Her voice was raspy and hoarse with pleasure.</p><p>“Good girl,” he smiled. “You sound thirsty. I think you need an offering.”</p><p>He dipped down into the pool, then came up with a mouthful of water.</p><p>He replaced his knee between her thighs, then hooked his thumb over her bottom teeth and dragged her mouth open. With his other hand, he yanked her head back by her hair. Tom leaned over her and spit a stream of water over her tongue. </p><p>He grinned slowly, then closed her mouth. “Drink,” he murmured, his black eyes flickering with playful lust.</p><p>How could she refuse?</p><p>Hermione swallowed as his hands gripped her hips, moving her up and down along his thigh. She placed her hands on his as she rolled against him, arching her back. He watched her sensual movements for several moments, his eyes roaming her breasts, the curve of her hips, the dips of her stomach. </p><p>Then he leaned in and whispered in her ear, his deep, raspy voice giving her goosebumps, “Next time, it will be my cum you’re swallowing, little witch.”</p><p>In that instant, Hermione fell into oblivion.</p><p>She released a strangled cry as stars burst upon her vision, her body exploding into night. Their eyes stayed locked and she felt his celestial magic all around her. She lost herself in him, forgetting who Tom was and even who <em> she </em>was. She allowed him to envelop her. Their essences merged, and Hermione felt that it was the most erotic moment of her life. “Tom,” she half moaned, half sobbed.</p><p>He nodded as he watched her. “I know, little witch,” he murmured as he brushed her hair from her cheek. His eyes hungrily drank in her reaction. “That’s why you’re mine.”</p><p>He leaned forward and kissed her. The pool suddenly faded from around them, and they were back in his shower, her legs wrapped around his waist and his fingers tangled in her hair.<br/><br/></p><hr/><p><br/>Hermione was at work, but she couldn’t focus.</p><p>She sat staring out the window in front of her desk, her eyes fixed on the street sign pointing toward the entrance of Knockturn Alley.</p><p>All she could think about was that morning.</p><p>Hermione was utterly terrified.</p><p>She felt as if she’d just leapt off a cliff in outer space, and now Hermione was falling into a cosmic wasteland of endless inertia, being sucked into the black hole of Tom Riddle. </p><p>She was in too deep now and didn’t know how to stop it.</p><p>She sat at her desk and couldn’t breathe; he was a powerful current, sweeping her away and pulling her underwater, no matter how hard she fought against him.</p><p>Her heart pounded in her chest. Was it possible to extricate herself now? She’d somehow convinced herself that as long as she fought him publicly, doing everything that she could to foil his plans, that nothing else was worth any significance. Whatever their dalliance was in private could always be ended if the lines became too muddied. </p><p>But now? She seriously doubted if someone were to hand her Tom’s horcruxes and a basilisk fang on a silver platter, that she would even be able to do what needed to be done.</p><p>Hermione suddenly felt the desire to run. To disappear. To go as far away as she possibly could, without notice.</p><p>Hermione had considered finding a way to have Tom sent to Azkaban. She had enough evidence to do so. But he was too smart for that. He had the dementors in his back pocket, she was sure of it. That was surely the way he’d broken Hausler out of Azkaban No, he would find a way out, and then he would hunt her down. </p><p>The only option she had was to kill him.</p><p>No wonder he’d garnered so much support; it was no surprise to her now why his followers had been so unyieldingly loyal. He was just too damned seductive.</p><p>“I can’t change him,” she whispered. “I can’t.”</p><p>Her chest ached. Who was the man she’d been with this morning? </p><p>It certainly wasn’t the Tom she knew.</p><p>What had changed?</p><p>She’d been laboring under the belief that if he knew the truth about her past, he would surely kill her.</p><p>She wasn’t entirely sure that wasn’t the case, but now she had doubts.</p><p>One thing was certain: she knew she was playing with fire. Hermione was walking a tightrope and was coming perilously close to falling.<br/><br/></p><hr/><p><br/>Later that day, Hermione received a note from Tom via the parchment. </p><p>
<em> I have business tonight. I won’t be back until late. You are free to stay over, but don’t wait up for me. </em>
</p><p>Hermione knew it was some dark arts/death eater related business, or else he would’ve been more specific. The note was short, clipped. He usually made some snarky remark or sexual innuendo, which told Hermione that he was preoccupied.</p><p>It was just as well, Hermione thought. She was quite shaken after this morning, and she felt she needed some space away from Tom for her own sanity. Perhaps a night to herself would help her refresh her course. She decided she would stay at her own flat tonight. She desperately needed to get that gentle, lusty, <em> playful </em> Tom from this morning <em> out </em> of her head.<br/><br/></p><hr/><p><br/>The next morning, Hermione bounced into work, feeling much more peppy and quite refreshed. She sat her tea on her desk and unfurled her scroll of notes. She was charged with reporting on the status of the ministerial campaigns this week and she had many notes to condense about speeches and pre-polling results. The election was within two weeks. Then Wilhelmina Tuft would be Minister.</p><p>Hermione wasn’t quite sure what she thought of her. There was something off about the woman, but she couldn’t put her finger on it.</p><p>“Dumbledore!” Hermione heard the voice of Baumgartner yelling her name. She turned to find her Editor-in-Chief waving her into his office.</p><p>She followed him to the back of the newsroom and he shut the door.</p><p>“Scratch the election bit for now. I need you to work on something else, and quickly.”</p><p>“Oh,” Hermione replied, surprised. “What is it?”</p><p>“I need you to get down to the Historical Society of Magic, in south London. There was a robbery last night. Wards were completely busted through. Some were dismantled. Some of the best protective enchantments ever created… just blown to smithereens. I don’t know what was taken but it was something important I’ll wager, because they won’t say what it was. I need you to find out. You’ve got a knack for that. Find out anything you can and then get started on the article stat, before news of it gets out.”</p><p>“Of course, sir.” Hermione left his office, checked to make sure she had her press badge, and apparated away.<br/><br/></p><hr/><p><br/>It was Friday evening, and Tom was at her flat. Hermione was cooking for him, as she often did of late. It was her way of ensuring that he was, indeed, eating real food.</p><p>He had an infuriating habit of sneaking around her and tasting her food while it was still in the process of cooking. He often dipped his finger into her sauce and sucked it off, or took a bite while she wasn’t looking. Hermione often had to chase him out of the kitchen, but she decided he just genuinely found it amusing to annoy the piss out of her.</p><p>She’d made several of Molly Weasley’s famous recipes, which had succeeded in Tom requesting her cooking as often as he dared. Hermione didn’t mind it; there was something satisfying about watching the expression on his face as he took a bite of her food. </p><p>“Fucking hell, witch,” he groaned as he sampled her latest dish. “I’m not the marrying sort, but you might be able to domesticate me, after all.”</p><p>Hermione snorted. “You assume <em> I’m </em>the marrying sort?”</p><p>He licked his lips, then fixed her with a piercing stare. “Are you not?”</p><p>Hermione looked down nervously. “I don’t know, I never thought about it.”</p><p>Tom smirked. “Hermione, I never asked you, but am I the first romantic entanglement you’ve ever had?”</p><p>“Of <em> course </em>not,” she said, somewhat insulted. </p><p>His eyes narrowed slightly. “Who?”</p><p>She froze, her eyes flicking to his. “What?”</p><p>He cocked his head. “Who was he?”</p><p>Her mouth fell open. “You really want to talk about past relationships?”</p><p>He smirked. “Well, I have none, so.”</p><p>Hermione glared at him icily. “That’s not entirely true.”</p><p>He rolled his eyes. “Shagging does not equate to a relationship, Hermione.”</p><p>“Then what would you call this?”</p><p>His eyes narrowed menacingly and his jaw tensed. “Would you prefer if I simply fucked you and left? Would that make things simpler for you?”</p><p>Hermione swallowed, then looked down at her plate. “I didn’t say that.”</p><p>“So who was it?”</p><p>Hermione huffed, then fixed him with an exasperated stare. “Well, there was a Bulgarian quidditch player...”</p><p>Tom burst out laughing. “A <em> what </em>?”</p><p>Hermione’s eyes narrowed. “You heard me.”</p><p>Tom sobered but his lips twitched as if holding back laughter. “A quidditch player, you say? Do you prefer athletic meatheads to philosophical wretches like myself?”</p><p>“You’re insufferable. I’m <em> here </em>, aren’t I?”</p><p>“Who else?”</p><p>Hermione’s face fell. “I’d rather not talk about it.”</p><p>Tom stared at her for a long minute. She didn’t look at him.</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>Hermione took a deep breath. “There are just some things I would rather not discuss with you. Is that alright?”</p><p>His eyes snapped with anger. “Another secret of yours?”</p><p>Hermione dropped her fork into her plate with a clatter. “Why are you so determined to believe that I’m hiding things?”</p><p>“I know that you are, Hermione. So you might as well stop pretending. Keep your secrets if you must, but do <em> not </em>lie to me and say that you don’t have them.”</p><p>Hermione said nothing; she merely sat fuming in silence.</p><p>Tom’s eyes burned into her. “Tell me who he was.”</p><p>“A childhood friend, Tom!” she snapped. “We danced around each other for years and he was all that I thought I wanted and then suddenly we kissed and then I… started running the other way. I left him hanging and I haven’t seen him since… and I don’t feel good about it. Especially given… well, <em> you </em>.” She swallowed, then looked away, trying not to let her expression break.</p><p>A minute dragged by in painful silence and Hermione couldn’t bear his searching gaze any longer so she stood up from the table and retreated out onto the balcony.</p><p>The cool night air caressed her skin as she stood against the brick balustrade, staring out at the London skyline. Her terrace was littered with plants and glowing lights; the fountain could be heard trickling in the background.</p><p>She wished he hadn’t asked about Ron. It made her betrayal seem so much more real and painful; as if her two worlds were about to collide. Had she thought she could keep them separate? The dam was bound to break at some point. She could have played her role so beautifully in this time if she hadn’t meddled with Riddle. But then again, was it even possible for them to avoid one another in <em> any </em>lifetime? Hermione was convinced that they were inevitably linked, no matter what world or timeline they found themselves in. Voldemort was always bound to break her in some way; as if they were fated to it.</p><p>Hermione’s head fell into her hands, and she choked on a sob. She couldn’t help the tears from squeezing through her lashes.</p><p>She heard the door open; then, his footsteps were slowly approaching. She didn’t look up. She couldn’t face him.</p><p>Suddenly, his arm encircled her waist and he grabbed her wrist, spinning her around to face him. She refused to open her eyes.</p><p>Hermione felt his fingers wiping away the tears staining her cheeks. It just made it all worse. She didn’t want this version of Tom. She could handle his violence, his vindictiveness, his arrogance, even his control. But this? This tender and understanding facet of a man she had thought to be incapable of any sort of feeling? It was absolute torture and she wanted to shove him away.</p><p>“Get away from me,” she sobbed as she pushed against his chest.</p><p>His arms tightened around her. “No,” he said sharply.</p><p>“Please, go away,” she choked out, but she laid her forehead against his chest.</p><p>He let her cry. She could feel his confusion, but he didn’t say a word; he didn’t ask her what was wrong. He simply stood and held her, letting her tears soak his shirt.</p><p>After a few minutes of an embarrassing and uncontrollable emotional display, Hermione lifted her head from his chest and wiped at her tears. “I’m sorry. I suppose that was a long time coming.”</p><p>He said nothing, but he rested his hand against her cheek, fingers spread wide and threaded into the locks framing her face. Then he tilted her head upward until their eyes met. “I’ll admit that I’m jealous. I wish to be the only wizard who can make you cry.”</p><p>Hermione gave a tearful laugh. “Trust me, you are. You don’t have to worry about <em> that </em>one.”</p><p>His eyes darkened. “I hope you’ll one day tell me what you mean by that.”</p><p>Hermione bit her lip, but said nothing. As much as she wanted so desperately to tell him the truth, she knew that she couldn’t. If he knew the truth, he would kill her. She wasn’t delusional enough to believe he cared about her that deeply. </p><p>There was no way that someone like Voldemort was capable of love or true loyalty. How could someone learn to love if they’ve never experienced it themselves? Harry said it best. Voldemort would never know love.</p><p>“So,” he whispered, a mischievous glint in his eyes. “Did these old boyfriends of yours ever touch you the way I touch you?”</p><p>Hermione gaped at him. He grinned, tightening his hold around her waist. </p><p>“You <em> are </em>jealous, aren’t you?” Hermione murmured, holding back laughter.</p><p>His eyes narrowed. “I’ll avada them.”</p><p>She rolled her eyes. “You’ll do no such thing.”</p><p>“Won’t I? Be careful with your words. You know how I <em> love </em>a challenge.”</p><p>“You can’t just kill everyone who inconveniences you, Tom. We’ve talked about this.”</p><p>His eyes sparkled with mirth. “I wouldn’t necessarily have to kill them. I’ve always wanted to try the portrait curse.”</p><p>Her eyebrows lifted. “The <em> what </em>?”</p><p>“Traps the target in a magical portrait.” He winked at her, and her heart stuttered. “The longer they’re trapped, they gradually lose touch with reality. Eventually, they go insane. So much more satisfying than murder, wouldn’t you say?”</p><p>She leaned forward until their lips were almost touching. “You’re sick in the head, Riddle.”</p><p>His eyes flicked to her lips. “Yet, here you are, being my good girl every night. So what does that make you?”</p><p>She fought back a smile. “I suppose that makes me even <em> more </em>disturbed.”</p><p>He smiled at her and the effect was devastating. “I think you’re far more unhinged than you like to admit, Dumbledore.”</p><p>Her breath caught. “You’re probably right.”</p><p>He inclined his head. “Aren’t I always?”</p><p>She rolled her eyes. “Dick.”</p><p>He grinned. “Ask nicely.” He bent over and hoisted her over his shoulder, hauling her back into her flat.<br/><br/></p><hr/><p> </p><p>Later that night, they lay in bed, facing one another in the dark. Her leg was thrown over his hip, and his hand was gripping the back of her thigh.</p><p>“I’ll be busy tomorrow evening. I won’t be back until late,” he whispered.</p><p>“I suppose I shouldn’t ask where you’re going.” She already knew. He’d be at Riddle House with his Death Eaters, and she intended to be there as well.</p><p>“A secret for a secret, love.”</p><p>His long fingers stroked her thigh softly. </p><p>“Well,” she breathed. “That’s perfectly fine. I’m working on a new article and it's a bit challenging. I could use the evening to work.”</p><p>“Am I the topic?”</p><p>She laughed under her breath. “Not unless you broke into the British Historical Society of Magic recently.”</p><p>There was a silent pause.</p><p>Her eyes widened. His face was but a blur in the darkness. “Wait… <em> did </em>you?”</p><p>“Of <em> course </em>not, Hermione. So why did they break in?”</p><p>She swallowed, not entirely convinced. He had been out very late Monday evening… That was the night the robbery occurred. She tucked her suspicions away to examine them later. “I don’t know. It was a robbery, apparently. I couldn’t get anyone to talk to me but I’ll go back down there in the morning.”</p><p>“You’re quite a skilled little sleuth. I’m sure you’ll be able to crack the case, <em> Detective </em>Dumbledore.”</p><p>Hermione laughed. “Septimus also called me that.”</p><p>“I’d say you’d make a good auror, but you possess potential far beyond that.”</p><p>Hermione felt her cheeks heating in the darkness. For some reason, whenever this wizard complimented her magical accomplishments, her stomach turned somersaults. Murderous lunatic or not, he was an incredibly accomplished wizard; possibly the greatest in the world.</p><p>“Are you blushing?”</p><p>“No!” She whisper-shouted. “Sod off, please.”</p><p>He laughed softly under his breath. “Your reaction to praise is <em> quite </em>entertaining, little witch.”</p><p>“You can fuck off, sir.”</p><p>His hand gripped her thigh and pulled her body closer. Leaning in, he whispered, “What if I were to tell you… that <em> you </em> are the most intriguing… <em> powerful… </em>and arousing witch that I’ve ever met in my life?”</p><p>Hermione swallowed. The rasp of his whisper in her ear ricocheted through her like a flaming arrow, striking every erogenous zone in her body and lighting them aflame.</p><p>“What if I told you that being buried inside you is the most supreme pleasure I’ve ever experienced? Do you know how your obedience affects me? Do you know what your moans and your tears do to me? If you did, I think you’d feel much less afraid of me... I think you’d realize that you have me in chains, Hermione.”</p><p>Hermione held her breath, unsure how to respond. He’d never spoken to her like this. She wanted to cry, because she knew that he had her in chains as well. More than he even knew.</p><p>His knuckles brushed against her cheek in the darkness. </p><p>“Good night, Hermione.”</p>

</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Riddle woke early on Saturday morning. He didn’t intend to meet his Death Eaters at the Leaky Cauldron today, since they would be meeting later in the evening at Riddle House, but he did have something on his mind. Tom turned to find Hermione curled up at his side. The room was still dark as it was well before sunrise. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom snaked his hand around her waist, stroking the soft skin of her side as he leaned in to whisper against her hair, “I have to go, Hermione. I have something to do.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Tom,” she mumbled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Go back to sleep,” he murmured, running his knuckles along her arm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll get up,” she said softly, her voice husky with sleep.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, love. Just go back to sleep. I’ll write you on the parchment when I get to work.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She hummed drowsily, her lashes fluttering and then she seemed to fall back into unconsciousness.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom lay staring at her for another minute; he took in her pert nose and defined cheekbones. His gaze swept over the soft parting of her lips and the delicate lashes that rested against her cheeks. Then he swallowed, his adam’s apple bobbing as he forced himself to throw back the covers, exposing his bare skin to the chilly morning air.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tonight was the night.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He cast a warming charm on himself, and headed to the bathroom to take a shower.</span>
</p><p>
<span> </span>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>It was just before sunrise, and Tom sat by the fire in the grand Malfoy Manor library, researching the Ribbon of Life, which was one of the required components for the Soul Bond. He’d never heard about such an object, and his employer seemed to also be ignorant of its existence. There was no mention of it in any book he’d ever read, and he was somewhat disheartened. If he couldn’t locate the artifact, then there was very little chance of him conducting the spell correctly. Tom still needed Hermione’s tears to finish the potion. He felt his frustration boiling over.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He heard the double doors open, and looked up to find Abraxas entering. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good morning, my Lord. I thought I heard someone floo into the parlor. More research?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom sighed. “Yes, Brax. Though I’m not sure I’m making any progress.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“If I can be of any aid, do utilize my expertise.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom snorted derisively and cocked an eyebrow. “Well, I suppose I do have a question for you. When we were discussing soulmate magic, you mentioned that you had used a spell to determine if Peoria was your soulmate. But the book you gave me only mentions a potion. What spell did you use?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ah,” Abraxas sighed. “Truthfully, my Lord, I was not able to locate the instructions for the potion. I searched and searched until I found a spell in an old spellbook. It was a rather silly spell and I didn’t place much hope in it. As I said, it was inconclusive so I wouldn’t recommend it. I don’t even think I recall the spell now, or even where I found the blasted thing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom nodded absentmindedly, his gaze faraway. “I see. Well, what do you know about the Ribbon of Life?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Abraxas’ brows furrowed. “Isn’t that needed for a soul bond ceremony?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom nodded stoically. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Malfoy’s face looked troubled. “Um, well… Forgive me but, are you intending to conduct a soul bond? With who?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom’s eyes narrowed. “My reasons for researching this have nothing to do with you, Malfoy. Answer the question.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course, my Lord,” Abraxas muttered coolly. “Well, it’s now called the Ribbon of Life, but it was once called the Thread of Fate. Soulmate magic dates back to ancient greece- it’s more or less all rooted in myth. The thread was woven at a great loom by the Moirai, or the Fates. They are three sisters, Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropos. The only book I have in this library that mentions it is called </span>
<em>
<span>Magic and the Gods</span>
</em>
<span>. There was a Greek witch who was very powerful, named Aikaterine. She sought immortality, and she believed that the essence which the gods breathed, the aether, would extend her life. She created a kind of containment spell and placed it on a box, which would capture the aether in its own vacuum. However, she needed to be brought to Olympus to conduct the experiment, so she dedicated her life to the worship of Atropos, the cutter of the threads which resulted in death for humans. She eventually seduced Atropos, and when Atropos brought her to Olympus, Aikaterine discovered that her experiment failed. Aether was a divine substance, and could not be contained by magic. Instead, Aikaterine convinced Atropos to take her to the loom, and Atropos showed her the thread of fate. Atropos told her that if she desired immortality, that she would never cut her thread as long as she promised not to betray their love. Aikaterine was a shrewd witch, and she did not truly love Atropos, so while the goddess was sleeping, Aikaterine stole her thread from the loom. She then spent the rest of her life hiding from the wrath of the Fates. Finally, when Aikaterine’s lover was killed, she decided she was ready to leave earth and journey to the underworld, so she cut the thread herself, and it was cleaved into two threads. The two halves of the ribbon of life were supposedly passed down through her family. Of course, this is all mythological,” Malfoy laughed. “None of it really adds up. It’s an old legend, like the wands of great power or the Fountain of Fair Fortune.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course,” Tom murmured, eyes narrowing. “It’s merely a myth, I’m sure. So who was Aikaterine’s lover?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Aikaterine was said to be the mother of Herpo the Foul’s children, oddly enough.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom’s head snapped up violently. “What did you say?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You do remember studying Herpo the Foul, in second year, don’t you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course I do,” Tom remarked acidly. “But… what do you mean, the mother of Herpo’s children? How could you know such a thing?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Find the book yourself if you don’t believe me. It’s in </span>
<em>
<span>Magic and the Gods</span>
</em>
<span>. I don’t remember the story well, but supposedly Atropos discovered that Herpo was Aikaterine’s reincarnated soulmate and attempted to cut his thread, but she was unable to for some reason. It’s insinuated that Aikaterine and Herpo were both on a quest together for immortality, which is what drove her to Atropos in the first place.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom’s eyes shifted back and forth as he took in this information. “Reincarnated… soulmates?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Malfoy nodded silently.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You said the thread was passed down, through her family?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“If I recall correctly, yes. You’ll have to read it for yourself.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fascinating. You seem to have learned more information about this particular topic than you did in all seven years at Hogwarts.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why learn when you can cheat?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom shook his head with a smirk. “Peoria must’ve been some shag to motivate your lazy arse to read.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Malfoy gave Tom a wry grin, but said nothing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Have your elf find the book for me.” Tom looked at his watch. “Shit. I have to go. I’m late.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So you won’t stay for coffee then, I assume?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, Malfoy. I’ll see you at Riddle House tonight.” Tom quickly left the library, swinging his heavy black cloak over his shoulders as he walked away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Malfoy watched him go. He stared into the fireplace long after Riddle had left, observing the flickering flames as the sun rose. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Abraxas had not been entirely truthful.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He </span>
<em>
<span>had</span>
</em>
<span> cast a spell in fourth year to determine his soulmate, but Peoria Parkinson wasn’t the target.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Peoria was merely the balm to soothe his aching heart.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He gazed at the place where Riddle had been sitting on his library sofa. The positioning reminded him so keenly of their usual spots in front of the Slytherin common room hearth. </span>
</p><p>
<span>He and Tom had once been closer than brothers. Once, Abraxas had even wondered if Tom might feel the same way that he felt.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Tom had never felt anything but cold ambition.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That is, until Hermione Dumbledore.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Abraxas sighed. It would be just his luck for the two people he desired the most to be drawn to each other.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He would know for sure tonight.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Tom apparated to Diagon Alley and stopped at the newsstand at the corner to pick up a newspaper before he walked to Borgin &amp; Burkes. There, on the front of the cover, was Wilhelmina Tuft.</p><p><br/>
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/9twmQLF/2909-ED63-1-B30-4561-B9-DD-8742-B1-CD6147.jpg%22%20alt=%222909-ED63-1-B30-4561-B9-DD-8742-B1-CD6147" alt />
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>It is a fantastic week in Wizarding Britain as we welcome a newly elected Minister for Magic, who will succeed the much-beloved Minister Leonard Spencer-Moon on our nation’s stage. This week we welcome the lively and brilliant Wilhelmina Tuft to the highest ministerial office in magical London. Tuft, age thirty-three, is mother to Ignatius Tuft and wife to Alberdeen Tuft, son of inventor and world-renowned thestral breeder, Carother Tuft. Tuft and her family reside at the Tuft Estate, just south of London, where many magical creatures, including the famed thestrals, are kept and bred.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Much of Tuft’s political success can be attributed to her mild and gentle manner, her inspiring and noteworthy speeches, and her admirably moderate views. On any given evening, you might find her riding the well-known Tuft thestrals, writing to her son, who is enrolled as a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, or even attending one of the renowned Malfoy Manor balls with those whom she calls the “rising stars” of the dawning post-war era. Among her political allies and proteges, we find the pureblooded Aeris Flint and the dark horse, Tom Riddle, both of whom are key figures to watch among London’s magical dignitaries. Tuft appears to have a keen eye for discovering powerful witches and wizards, whom we find rising to prominence and distinction in London society. This witch is a luminary for the future of the wizarding world, and we will be watching her career with bated breath.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>The Daily Prophet has confirmed that our principal journalist, Hermione Dumbledore, will be interviewing Tuft for a post-election feature story.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Tom read the article as he walked to work, dodging hags and cloaked vampires as he went.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When he got to the shop, he began absentmindedly sorting through a set of sorcerer’s spectacles as he drank his coffee. </span>
</p><p>
<span>He hoped tonight went as planned. Tom wasn’t entirely sure that the rites would work with ashes rather than the actual bones of the wizard, but he intended to try regardless. He’d felt the dark magic leaking from the urn, so he knew there was something to be gained from attempting it all the same. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom pulled the parchment from his robes and unfurled it. There was a message from his witch and he grinned, then dipped his quill in the inkwell, and penned a response.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>Hermione walked into the Daily Prophet and immediately began to gather her notes from her desk drawers. She planned to visit the ministry today and question the DMLE about the robbery. Then, next week, she was scheduled for an interview with Wilhelmina Tuft, which Hermione would need to prepare questions for as well. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As she readied her quill and parchments, she heard a tapping on the window. She looked up to find two large owls bearing parcels sitting on the window sill.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione opened the window and took the packages. There was a single note attached, which read: </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Good luck with your case today. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>P.S. Use the incantation ‘excresco.’</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>TMR</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione’s brows drew forward and she opened the first parcel. It was a medium-sized plant pot with soil inside. Hermione stared at it curiously, then tapped the pot with her wand and murmured, “Excresco.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The soil began to move, and then, a little green bud burst forth from the dirt; not a moment later, there were several more green shoots growing right before her eyes. Slowly, the buds took the form of a miniature rose bush, blossoming forth with vibrant red, fuschia, and lavender roses. In between the roses, babies breath, nightshade, and lavender developed, until there was a small burgeoning garden filling the pot. It was so beautiful that Hermione stood in awe. Had Tom enchanted it himself? As she continued to watch the rose petals unfurl, a little note bloomed from one of the flowers. She took the parchment and unrolled it.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Here is a bit of ‘non-dark’ magic which I crafted purely for your pleasure, little witch, to prove that I am, in fact, not a ‘one trick pony’. I imagine the garden of your soul to be far more beautiful than this, but I did my best.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione’s lips parted as she gazed at the garden, which was delicate, full of life, and saturated with color. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wow, Hermione,” said Eulessia Baron, who whistled as she approached the desk. “Who’s the secret admirer?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione cleared her throat. “No one.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Eulessia snorted. “</span>
<em>
<span>Sure</span>
</em>
<span>, Hermione. I suppose that was sent by an adoring fan, then?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione held back a smile. “Something like that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mhmm,” hummed Eulessia, casting her a side-long glance as she giggled and walked away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione reached out and let her fingertips graze one of the blood-red roses. She swallowed, then took a tremulous breath and reached for the other parcel, which was wrapped in brown paper. She ripped away the paper to reveal a wooden box. She unlatched it and inside, there lay the most elegant metal-nibbed quill she’d ever seen. The feather was pure white with black markings, and the pen itself was a bejeweled golden filigree. Hermione had </span>
<em>
<span>never </span>
</em>
<span>owned such a beautiful quill. There was a note inside the box.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Don’t ask what I had to do to get this quill, but rest assured that there was no murder involved. It belonged to the famous spell-book author Miranda Goshawk and was used to write the Standard Book of Spells, Volumes III and IV. I thought it should be used by a witch of similar talents.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione’s mouth fell open and she couldn’t help the smile of pure joy that spread across her face. She had always been a huge fan of Miranda Goshawk and despite the potentially nefarious methods he’d employed to obtain it, the gesture made her heart skip several beats.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione felt her cheeks heating. Why the sudden romantic gesture from him? </span>
</p><p>
<span>She sat down and unfurled the parchment with which they typically communicated. She wrote a quick note.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I thought you said you’re not a romantic?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>After a few minutes, his reply appeared on the parchment.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I’m not.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She penned a response: </span>
<em>
<span>Why the gifts, then?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>His reply came swiftly. </span>
<em>
<span>You’ve an odd way of saying thank you.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She bit her lip and  wrote, </span>
<em>
<span>“Thank you.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>A moment later, she added,</span>
<em>
<span> I just wondered what you meant by it.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Her cheeks reddened and she hid her face in her hands. She really should be thinking about her article, and about the Death Eaters meeting she would be crashing that night, which would be potentially very dangerous, but he’d caught her off-guard.</span>
</p><p>
<span>His answer manifested on the parchment.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Let’s see… we fuck on the regular and sleep in the same bed every night. What do you think it means, my dense little witch?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione’s breath caught, eyes widening. What was he saying?</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>What the devil was he saying?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Her heart pounded. She knew exactly what he was saying. But since when had their arrangement transformed from merely a late night shag into… something more?</span>
</p><p>
<span>What </span>
<em>
<span>were</span>
</em>
<span> they exactly?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione gulped. She scrawled a reply quickly onto the parchment.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Thank you for the gifts. They’re lovely. Now, I must go to the Ministry. Talk later.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Then, she rolled up the parchment without waiting for his response.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her life was complicated enough without allowing a romantically-inclined dark lord to sway her off course.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Not a romantic, my arse,</span>
</em>
<span> Hermione thought.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She </span>
<em>
<span>would</span>
</em>
<span> find out if he was the Historical Society’s thief, </span>
<em>
<span>and </span>
</em>
<span>she would discover what his Death Eaters were up to.</span>
</p><p>
<span>No amount of roses or quills would distract her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Still, Hermione smiled to herself as she watered the roses and gingerly slid the quill in her beaded bag.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, she set out for the Ministry of Magic.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>“Can you at least tell me what was taken?” Hermione exclaimed, already exasperated with the man. </p><p>
<span>Gaspard Dufresne leaned back in his chair, pinching the area between his eyes as if the witch before him were giving him a catastrophic headache. “Why is it that you always end up at my door every time I’m trying to simply do my job and conduct an investigation in peace?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione cocked a brow sharply. “Because I’m the only reporter that seems to be able to get any answers. I also happened to uncover a few things about the Azkaban breach, that neither you, nor your aurors seemed to be able to. All in one day, mind you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Gaspard leaned forward, his irritation spilling over. “Yes, and what did you do? You published it for the entirety of London to read, rather than turn the information over to the DMLE, resulting in mountains of howlers being sent to the Ministry and constant protests outside the Ministry which have </span>
<em>
<span>still </span>
</em>
<span>not died down. All of London is calling for the destruction of Azkaban prison thanks to you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione’s chin lifted haughtily. “Yes, well, I don’t work for the DMLE, I work for the Daily Prophet.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Exactly,” he spat. “So you have no business being here, nor do I owe you any classified information about the robbery. I made the mistake of opening my mouth to you once. I won’t make that mistake again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione rolled her eyes. “And I’ll tell you like I told you last time. If you don’t give me the information, I’ll go rogue and get the information elsewhere. You saw how well it worked out for you and your department last time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, yet you used my name and the information I gave you.” Gaspard’s jaw tensed. “You might be Dumbledore’s daughter, but as I’ve heard it said, the new Minister may not be as keen on you as Moon was. Don’t get yourself in trouble with the Ministry, Miss.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione smiled sweetly and leaned forward, mirroring his posture. “I’m a big girl. I can handle myself. Besides, you're not my father and I’m not here for your advice. I’m here to do my job.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>His eyes flicked downward over her in an unintended appraisal before lifting to meet her gaze. His blue eyes were intense as they stared into hers, and it struck Hermione that he was incredibly handsome. Not only that, but the way he looked at her betrayed an attraction which he’d seemingly been hiding up until now. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She recalled hearing his name back in her own time; he was always spoken of, particularly by Moody and Kingsley, as one who had revolutionized the auror department. A Ministry hero. One who had imprisoned countless dark wizards following the Global Wizarding War. She was truthfully quite honored to be in his presence, but that didn’t make his gruff manner any less frustrating.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione averted her eyes and said, “Can you at least tell me what was taken?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Gaspard stared at her with icy blue eyes. He ejected a violent stream of air through his nose. “Do not </span>
<em>
<span>quote </span>
</em>
<span>me in your blasted article, if you ever want me to help you again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione nodded eagerly. “Very well.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>His jaw tensed and he took a deep breath. “It was an urn, containing the ashes of a dark wizard from the ancient world.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione’s mouth fell slightly ajar. “A dark wizard?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Gaspard nodded, the lines of his face hard and austere.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Have you…” Hermione began, but she hesitated. </span>
</p><p>
<span>He raised his eyebrows. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She twisted her lips to one side. “Have you investigated the dark wizard gang behind the Azkaban breach?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He inclined his head, expression blank. “We have looked into it. Someone has covered their tracks well. But it looks as if Pilloughby will be released. I suppose you are to thank for that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione swallowed and nodded. “Well, I’m glad to hear it..”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It could be interconnected, Miss Dumbledore, but we have very little to go on. We have no authorization to perform analysis on any wizard’s wand without a wand warrant, and that cannot be gained without evidence or provocation, both of which we do not have..”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione wondered if she could get Gaspard the information he needed. Did she even want to? Her chest tightened. Any thought of turning over information about Riddle or his Death Eaters to the DMLE felt like a terrible betrayal. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Who told you that Minister Tuft isn’t keen on me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He shrugged. “It’s just one of those things being whispered these days.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione lifted her eyebrows and chuckled under her breath. As if she didn’t have enough enemies.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, I’ll be interviewing her next week, so I suppose I’ll find out for sure then.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Gaspard simply gazed at her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well,” Hermione breathed as she stood to leave. “Thank you for that bit of information. I wager it will help me a good deal. I’ll go back down to the Historical Society today.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hermione,” Gaspard interjected, standing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione turned back, her eyebrows raised at his sudden use of her first name. </span>
</p><p>
<span>He stared at her for a moment. “Did you happen to receive my letter?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>It took a moment for his question to register. “Oh,” she said as the realization dawned. “Yes, I did.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He slid his hand into his pocket, his eyebrows raised as he waited for her to continue.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Shit,</span>
</em>
<span> she thought. She’d completely forgotten that he had invited her to attend the Minister’s inauguration ball. It was next weekend. She’d been so shocked that he had asked her that she had completely forgotten to respond in the moment. He’d only ever treated her like an annoying insect that he couldn’t wait to get rid of so he could get back to work. Needless to say, she was rather surprised when she received a very detached and professionally worded letter asking to escort her to the event.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good grief, I’m sorry, Gaspard,” she muttered, throwing a hand up to her forehead. Her cheeks pinked. “This week has been rather intense for me and I completely forgot.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>His lips parted as if to say something, but he stopped himself. His brows knitted slightly.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Merlin,</span>
</em>
<span> Hermione thought. </span>
<em>
<span>I’m surely embarrassing the hell out of this poor man.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She cleared her throat. “Of course, I would love to go.” She stopped herself from saying anything further. She gauged his reaction. Despite knowing the dramatic age difference between them, she didn’t really feel that there was that great of a gap when she looked at him. To Hermione, he looked almost like an older brother. He appeared to her like one of the seventh year students had when she’d started at Hogwarts as a first year. He was rather intimidating, truth be told.</span>
</p><p>
<span>His eyebrows shot up sharply. “You would?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She shrugged and then nodded. “Why not?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>His expression was unreadable. He ran his hand over his face and then nodded in return. “Good.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione looked around awkwardly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He crossed the room and opened the door for her. They stood mere feet apart,  and he gazed down at her. He was as tall or possibly even taller than Riddle, making his presence rather imposing. “I look forward to it,” he muttered. Then, he held out his hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione shook it, then left without another word. </span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p><br/>
Dolohov kissed Walburga Black; he kissed her hard, like he meant it.</p><p>
<span>He had her pinned to the wall of her bedroom at Grimmauld Place. Her knickers and stockings lay on the floor, the only signs of their illicit activities that afternoon. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She broke the kiss. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I do have to come up for air at some point, you know,” she muttered huskily. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, you don’t,” he grinned, gripping her throat with his massive hand and giving it a squeeze.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She batted his hand away. “I don’t like when you do that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He smirked. “It’s cute that you think I care what you like or don’t like.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She glared at him. “It reminds me of Riddle. Do you want me thinking of Tom while you’re railing me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dolohov scowled. “Salazar, is there anything he </span>
<em>
<span>didn’t</span>
</em>
<span> do to you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her red lips spread into a mischievous smile. “He rarely ever kissed me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“There’s the smile I like to see.” He kissed her again, then zipped his pants and buckled his belt.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I have to go soon. Have a meeting tonight.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her blue eyes sparkled. “That’s right, I nearly forgot. You all set a little trap for the Dumble-whore.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He tossed a glance at her and then muttered, “Yes, which reminds me. I need you to obliviate me before I leave, just in case Voldemort decides to have a little peek in my head.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She rolled her eyes as she slid her stockings back on. “You all keep obliviating yourselves and you’ll likely turn your brains to mush.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dolohov grinned. “My brain’s already mush, love. Can’t do much more damage than my old man did.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Walburga smirked, then stood and approached him seductively. “Oh, I bet I could.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she neared, he gripped her arm roughly and pulled her against him. “My head’s not the part of me you should be concerned with, my dear.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She batted her lashes coyly. “I think I’ve been giving you quite enough attention, Max. Don’t you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not by a long shot. I’ve got an insatiable appetite.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good,” she whispered hoarsely. “So have I.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>His eyes narrowed. “I hate to dagger poor Orion in the back, but it’s simply an unfortunate business that he happens to be engaged to the girl I want.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She looked down at his chest and twirled her fingers in the hair there idly. “It’s just sex, Max.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sure it is,” he muttered. “For now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Walburga hated to do the very thing to Dolohov that Riddle had done to her, but she figured if she could live through it, so could he.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you think she will show?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What? To the ritual tonight?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Walburga nodded. </span>
</p><p>
<span>He snaked an arm around her slim waist. “I don’t know, but a few things will be clear if she does. For one, it will confirm she was at Tom’s place when he wasn’t there. And, if she gets herself caught, which is what I hope will happen, Riddle’s response will tell us everything we need to know. If he deals with her, then we don’t have to worry about her anymore. If he doesn’t, then it’ll be obvious that he’s pussy-whipped by a muggle-lover.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Walburga smiled sweetly. “And are you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Am I what?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Pussy-whipped.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dolohov’s eyes narrowed and he leaned forward until their lips nearly touched. “So what if I am? Riddle’s a fool.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Walburga lifted her wand to his temple. “I want to ruin her. </span>

<em>"There’s A Story In My Family That A Phoenix Will Come To Any Dumbledore Who Is In Desperate Need."</em>
</h2><p align="center">
<em>- Albus Dumbledore</em>
</p><p><br/>Hermione tossed the invisibility cloak over her head and apparated to Little Hangleton. She wore her wand in a holster on her arm and a goblin-wrought blade strapped to each thigh. It was now November and it was quite cold. Hermione typically wore stockings, heels, and skirts to work along with a warm cloak, but tonight she didn’t want anything bulky beneath the invisibility cloak, nor anything which would impede her ability to run if necessary, so she’d opted for a pair of black leggings and a long-sleeved black shirt which she’d still had in her beaded bag from her time on the run with Ron and Harry. She appeared just in front of the little cottage belonging to Frank the gardener, where she’d awoken nearly a year ago.</p><p>Just the sight of the mammoth brick and stone mansion gave her chills. The windows were dark, save for one window on the bottom floor which was lit with an eerie green glow. She assumed the meeting was taking place there.</p><p>Hermione crept up to the mansion stealthily and peered into the window. The glass was rather dirty, but she could make out several black cloaked figures inside, though the lighting was dim. She hoped that Frank had taken her advice and gotten far away from this place.</p><p>Now, Hermione just needed to find a way inside. It was too dangerous to apparate in, and she couldn’t very well just walk through the front door of the mansion. She circled around the opposite side of the mansion, looking for any doors that might be unlocked or windows she might sneak in through.</p><p>Then, Hermione caught sight of a little wooden stairwell that led to a terrace on the second floor. It looked to be a servant’s entrance. Hermione took the steps and withdrew her wand, whispering, “<em> Alohomora </em>,” before trying the doorknob. It opened soundlessly, and Hermione took a deep breath as she stepped through the doorway.</p><p>There was nothing but dead silence as she stepped into the Butler’s pantry on the second floor. The stairwell had likely given servants easy access to an outdoor kitchen. She cast a silencing charm on her feet and moved deftly through the pantry and out into a long hallway. The hallway ended with an open balcony and a railing which overlooked the grand foyer of the home. A massive chandelier hung from the ceiling, but it was coated with a thick layer of dust. Before Hermione was a sweeping, curved staircase with an intricately carved wooden railing. She tiptoed down the stairs carefully. The home was beautiful, but there was something in the atmosphere that disturbed Hermione, an imprint of dark magic, cold and evil, as if the memory of murder was imbued into its walls. </p><p>Hermione began to pick up on the sound of muffled voices. Her steps slowed as she thought through her options. If she knew Tom, he would likely have placed protective enchantments on the room. Wouldn’t he? </p><p><em> Although, </em> she thought, <em> he wouldn’t have expected anyone to know of this place. Perhaps he hadn’t taken such precautions.  </em></p><p>She would have to be careful.</p><p>Hermione made her way through the dark, unlit home. The sun was going down and many of the rooms had thick draperies drawn over the windows. Hermione wasn’t brave enough to cast <em> lumos </em>, so she simply felt her way in the dimness, following the sound of the voices. </p><p>She came to a door in a dark corridor. The voices seemed to be coming from the other side. She needed to get inside the room if she wanted to know what was taking place on the other side of that door. Her heart pounded in her chest, adrenaline coursing through her veins. </p><p><em> This is incredibly stupid, </em> she thought. But she had to know what Tom was up to. Perhaps she would gain enough valuable information to help Gaspard with his investigation. If Hermione could put his Death Eaters in Azkaban, part of her work would be done. Perhaps, with the unrest of the public as to the safety of Azkaban, a new prison would soon be in the works. But Hermione still had her doubts. Tom was too powerful. What if he had been the thief to break into the Historical Society? Those wards were some of the most powerful ever created. They’d been dismantled to perfection; <em> blown to smithereens, </em> even <em> . </em> No, she wouldn’t be able to do much damage without striking the head: Voldemort. Hermione shivered, but she forced herself to shake off the fear. </p><p>Hermione unhooked a charm from her bracelet, and cast a transfiguration spell. The charm morphed into a crow, and she tossed it into the air. It beat its wings and cawed, attempting to fly down the opposite end of the corridor, and the sound was overly loud in the silence of the hallway, causing Hermione to wince. She stood back from the doorway, pressed tightly against the wall next to it, not daring to even breathe. Not a moment later, the door was whipped open and two bodies exited. Hermione couldn’t see who it was, but they moved down the hallway to investigate. Hermione took her chance and spun around, slipping into the room soundlessly. </p><p>She found herself in a large drawing room. The room was lit by dusty bronze sconces that hung on the walls, but magical green flames had been lit within them. Hermione pressed back against the wall in a corner of the room. Was this the room where Tom had murdered his father and grandparents? A chill ran down her spine. The atmosphere in the room was ominous.</p><p>There was an enormous round table in the center of the room. All around the table sat Tom’s Death Eaters, each wearing a heavy hooded cloak and a silver mask covering their entire face. The masks merely had lines or holes in the mouth for breathing, making it impossible for Hermione to know who was who. She would have to listen carefully to their voices. </p><p>The nearest Death Eater was about seven feet from where Hermione stood. But her attention didn’t linger long on the occupants of the table. Her eyes fell on a man who was bound and gagged, and suspended in the air above the table. Below him, in the center of the table, there was a small pyre lit with green flames. There was also a full-length mirror set on the table, and a large basin filled with water. Hermione’s heart stopped. Fear gripped her, for beside the basin sat what appeared to be a large black urn. It <em> had </em>to be the urn which was taken from the Historical Society.</p><p>Tom had lied to her face.</p><p>She supposed that was to be expected. She was also lying to him, and he knew that. He probably assumed that if he told her the truth, she’d run off and write an article about it, or turn him in. She probably would have, truth be told. But she couldn’t help feeling a bit stung by it. Particularly by his well wishes that morning toward her investigation. It felt almost as if he were mocking her.</p><p>It didn’t matter. Hermione steeled her emotions. She wouldn’t allow her judgment to be clouded by her feelings.</p><p>A man whom she assumed was Tom stood in front of his chair at the table, seemingly looking at the man hanging in the air. He wore a black cloak with his hood drawn, and a white mask covered his face.</p><p>The two Death Eaters who’d gone out into the hallway returned. </p><p>“It was just a bird,” one of them announced. They took their seats.</p><p>The man with the white mask took a deep breath, and then spoke. “Gentlemen,” he announced, and his voice confirmed to Hermione that it was, in fact, Tom. She couldn’t help but shudder at the scene before her. </p><p>“Tonight you will solidify the bonds of your brotherhood. From this day forth, you will bear the mark of your loyalty. A mark which stems from the spirit of the wizard whose ashes sit in the urn before you. The greatest wizard to ever walk the earth, and my ancestor, and the ancestor of Slytherin himself. You will pledge your loyalty to this legacy, a covenant of magical blood. You will take part in the most powerful fraternity of wizards to ever exist, and together, we will ensure that magical blood is never needlessly spilt at the hands of the lesser race. We will ensure the protection of our kind. After all, magic is might.”</p><p>At that, a chorus of voices rang out, “Magic is might!”</p><p>“Tonight, I will absorb the power encased in these ashes. But first… Dolohov.” Tom beckoned to one of the masked men, who stood and walked to stand beside Tom. </p><p>Riddle gripped his arm and ripped back his sleeve, then held it up for everyone to see. He pointed to the dark mark, a light red tattoo burned into his tanned skin. The snake seemed to move as it emerged from the maw of the skull.</p><p>“Tonight, you will all take the mark. Starting with you, Abraxas.”</p><p>Another Death Eater stood, the one nearest Tom, and he held out his arm. Tom held out his wand and muttered a spell, and a beam of light shot out from his wand, sparking and hissing when it hit flesh, and she watched in horror as he etched the mark into Malfoy’s arm. Abraxas bent over, seeming to be in a great deal of pain, his hand shaking and fingers curling. Smoke rose from the cauterized skin. Then, it was over. He was branded for life.</p><p>Hermione watched as they each, one-by-one, received the mark without question. She felt sick to her stomach. </p><p>So <em> this </em>was what Tom was doing when he told her he had “business.” He was conducting his Death Eater meetings and performing dark magic rituals. Some part of her knew it already, but to see it happening in front of her eyes awoke a fear within her that she hadn’t allowed herself to feel yet.</p><p><em> Good, </em> she thought. <em> Perhaps this will bring me to my senses.  </em></p><p>She’d allowed his charm to lull her into a sense of normalcy. </p><p>She hadn’t fully trusted him before, but she had felt herself beginning to. She certainly would <em> not </em>trust him going forward.</p><p>He was still a dangerous and powerful dark lord, intent on destroying muggleborns and muggles alike.</p><p>The thought filled her with dread.</p><p>When each of his followers had been branded, Voldemort gripped Dolohov’s arm and pressed his finger to the mark. They each gasped, gripping their arms as they looked down at their marks. The light red marks had turned black and began to burn.</p><p>“When I summon you… you will come. The mark enables you to apparate to me. It is an oath, a binding contract.” He slowly gazed around at the circle of faces. “My contacts at the ministry assure me that we will move against the Statute of Secrecy this year. I am putting measures in place to ensure that not only will we be successful, but you will never face the danger of imprisonment. We will act carefully, and slowly. We will recruit the most powerful witches and wizards in magical society. It will take years, but we will accomplish our goals, I assure you.” Voldemort lifted his head, peering through the eyeholes of his mask at the man floating in the air, void of consciousness.</p><p>Hermione felt a lump in her throat. How was this the man who had held her last night as she fell asleep? Who had sent her thoughtful gifts only hours before? Once again, she felt her stomach turn.</p><p>“My power already rivals that of Albus Dumbledore. My power and ability steadily grows. There will soon be no witch or wizard who will be able to defy me. You are each in the safest position you could be in: at my side. You have proved your loyalty tonight. For that reason, I will allow you all to witness a once-in-a-lifetime occurrence: a magical transformation so powerful that there are few alive who are even aware of its existence.”</p><p>Voldemort suddenly leapt onto the surface of the table. He walked toward the flames at its center and with a wave of his hand, he conjured a knife. Hermione’s eyes widened. <em> What was he about to do? </em> She couldn’t stop him. It would be far too dangerous.</p><p>Despite herself, she felt an aching in her heart. Suddenly, she wished that she had been able to be candid with him, to somehow talk him out of this dark path he was set on.</p><p><em> I cannot change him, </em> she told herself. She chanted it in her mind as she watched his actions with horror and heartbreak.</p><p>With the knife, he cut a deep gash in his hand. The blood dripped from his palm, sizzling as it met the flames. “The blood of the vessel,” he announced. The flames shifted in color from green to dark purple. </p><p>He stepped across the table and took up the urn. “The bones of the mage,” he said reverently. He lifted the lid and poured the contents into the basin of water. </p><p>The room was eerily silent. </p><p>Then, he held his wand aloft and flicked it toward the hovering body. “Rennervate,” he muttered.</p><p>The man’s eyes fluttered open. He took in his surroundings for a moment, and then began to scream.</p><p>“Silencio,” Voldemort whispered, so low that Hermione barely heard it.</p><p>The sound of the man’s screams was cut off abruptly.</p><p>“Non-magical blood, a living sacrifice,” he said with a sinister laugh. There were chuckles from around the table. </p><p>The man fought against his bonds to no avail. After a moment, with the eyes of the room watching, Voldemort raised the knife and slit the man’s throat. Hermione’s hand flew to her mouth to stifle her scream. The man’s blood poured into the fire from the gash in his throat, causing the flames to hiss and sputter. The purple flames transformed into a bright red.</p><p>Hermione squeezed her eyes shut, holding back a sob.</p><p>It took far too long for the man’s body to drain of blood. Silent tears trickled down Hermione’s cheeks; the only sound that could be heard was the dripping of his life force and the crackling of the flames.</p><p>Hermione took a deep breath to stem her nausea.</p><p>Soon, the muggle was hanging limply in the air, his face pale and eyes white and listless. Hermione’s eyes bored into Tom’s mask. She decided that she hated him.</p><p>How on earth had she convinced herself that such a monster could care about her?</p><p>She swallowed back the bile that threatened to rise.</p><p>Riddle bent down and gripped the end of a torch that lay in the flames, bringing with it the brilliant red fire. Then, he walked across the table and stood above the basin of water.</p><p>Hermione gasped soundlessly. As he stood looking into the water, his reflection showed in the full-length mirror that faced her. </p><p>What strange, dark magic was this?</p><p>Suddenly, it occurred to her.</p><p>It was a scrying mirror.</p><p>But those were typically used for divination.</p><p>Voldemort gazed into the water as if he were seeking answers. The hair on the back of Hermione’s neck stood straight up as she stared directly into the white mask reflected in the full-length mirror. She swallowed, her pulse beating rapidly in her throat.</p><p>Slowly, he held the flaming torch to the water. Instead of being doused, the flames caught and spread across the surface of the basin, filling it with flames.</p><p>He dropped the torch.</p><p>Some of his Death Eaters stood abruptly, gazing up at their Lord, clearly enraptured by the show of magic before them.</p><p>Voldemort lifted his sinister white wand; it resembled a long piece of bone. He flourished it above his head, in a complex wand movement.</p><p>“<em> Aracta Semprula! Sethia Ectirus! </em>”</p><p>Suddenly, the flames turned black as obsidian.</p><p>Then, without hesitation, Tom <em> stepped into </em> the basin, directly into the midst of the flames.</p><p>Hermione clapped her hand over her mouth to prevent herself from crying out. She’d almost run forward to try to stop him.</p><p>Tom’s entire body had disappeared into the basin, which was no more than a foot deep.</p><p>Hermione felt herself hyperventilating. She squeezed her eyes shut and leaned her head back against the wall to steady herself. Her head spun, made dizzy by the overwhelming presence of dark magic in the room. It was stifling; she felt it pricking her skin and clouding her mind. A thick smoke filled the room; it had a strange, sickly sweet scent. It made Hermione want to vomit.</p><p>Minutes passed in stoic silence. As the smoke cleared, she watched as a few of the Death Eaters leaned over the basin. The flames had vanished, and the water was now still and clear. The masked figures turned their heads to look at one another, but they said nothing. </p><p>There was nothing but silence as they waited.</p><p>Suddenly, a piercing, guttural scream issued forth from the air. The voice was Tom’s, but it seemed to have come from nowhere. It made Hermione’s skin crawl.</p><p>Death Eaters flinched, turning their masked heads this way and that to decipher where the scream had come from.</p><p>But their Lord was nowhere to be found.</p><p>Silence stretched painfully. The lifeless body hung in the air.</p><p>Hermione held her breath.</p><p>Despite her anger and hatred for what she’d just witnessed, she felt a deep-seated fear. It was innate and irrevocable, holding her captive against her will. His scream had penetrated right through to her soul, leaving her deeply shaken.</p><p>“Tom,” she whispered inaudibly. “Where are you?”</p><p>Then, as if she’d summoned him with her words, he fell through the scrying mirror onto the table, collapsing in a crumpled heap.</p><p>She drew in a sharp breath. </p><p>He didn’t move.</p><p>His Death Eaters looked at one another, but no one spoke.</p><p>“Please, Tom,” Hermione pleaded silently. “Get up.”</p><p>After several minutes, he groaned.</p><p>The masked figure she knew to be Abraxas started out of his seat and made as if to help Tom up, but Riddle held out his hand to stop him.</p><p>He slowly lifted himself onto his hands and knees, taking deep breaths. Then, he pulled himself up until he was able to stand. </p><p>No one spoke, perhaps out of fear or awe, or a little of both.</p><p>Tom held his hands out before him. Then, he lifted his hand, and the body of the muggle man instantly burst into flames. </p><p>Several of his Death Eaters jumped back, visibly shaken.</p><p>Tom was silent for a stretch. He held out his arms, flexing his hands.</p><p>“I have absorbed the power,” Tom began, his voice hoarse and dry. “Of Herpo the Foul.”</p><p>There were gasps throughout the room.</p><p>“But… Herpo?” one of his followers said. “You mean… <em> the </em> Herpo?”</p><p>“Are you aware of another?” Tom spat acidly.</p><p>The Death Eater lowered his head.</p><p>Then Riddle leapt off of the table, directly in front of Hermione.</p><p>She could feel the dark magic emanating from him. Her heart couldn’t help but feel grieved.</p><p>He began to walk past her. </p><p>Then, he stopped dead in his tracks.</p><p>Suddenly, Tom’s head whipped to the side. He stood with his back to Hermione, but the profile of his white mask was visible. </p><p>He turned toward her slowly.</p><p>He was staring right at her from a few short feet away. She could see the whites of his eyes, then the red irises and his pupils which were blown wide. His eyes darted back and forth, searching the space where she stood. Hermione’s heart began to beat out of her chest, so violently that she feared he could hear it.</p><p>It was so quiet, she could hear him take a deep breath through his nose. He exhaled. His Death Eaters began to look at one another, then back to where he stood. </p><p>He reached a gloved hand into the air in front of Hermione. She held her breath, pressing her back to the wall behind her to avoid his reach. She didn’t dare breathe or even swallow. Fear washed over her like an icy current.</p><p>His fingertips came within mere inches of the invisibility cloak and grabbed at the air; then, he pulled back his hand. She leaned her head back against the wall in silent relief.</p><p>Still, he stared at her; she knew he couldn’t see her, but that knowledge still didn’t quell the deep unease that Hermione felt in the pit of her stomach.</p><p>Could he sense her? Had they become so close in recent months that he could feel her presence?</p><p>She watched as the mask tilted downward, and then he turned back to his Death Eaters.</p><p>She was now facing the back of his cloak, and she thanked her lucky stars that her presence hadn’t been revealed.</p><p>She released her breath in halting degrees as her apprehension eased.</p><p>“Gentlemen,” Voldemort addressed his followers. “If you value your lives, do not ever speak of what has transpired here tonight. You may go. Our business tonight has been completed.” </p><p>His followers sat gazing at him for a moment longer. Then, one by one, they each stood and crossed the room to stand before him and bowed low before apparating away. </p><p>Abraxas was the last to depart.</p><p>When he left, Hermione was left alone with Riddle.</p><p>Tom stood with his back to Hermione for several minutes. He held his hand out before him, flexing his fingers as if adjusting to the increase in magical power. </p><p>Hermione tried to turn on her heel and apparate away, but something prevented her. Had he enchanted the mansion so that only his followers could apparate in or out? She silently cursed. Every moment that dragged on made her more and more anxious.</p><p>She would have to wait until Tom left before she could leave. She couldn’t very well just walk to the door, open it, and traipse out of the room.</p><p>He crossed to the table and picked up his wand. Hermione’s heart rate sped up. </p><p>She gripped her wand tightly. Should she stun him?</p><p>Suddenly, he spun around, his black cloak whirling about his frame.</p><p>“<em> Hominum revelio </em>,” he muttered, flicking his wand.</p><p>“Shit,” she cursed. “<em> Stupefy </em>!”</p><p>Her spell knocked him back and bought her a few seconds as she ran across the room and ripped open the door, fleeing the ghastly scene.</p><p>She heard him scrambling to his feet with a curse. She sped down the hallway, still hidden by the invisibility cloak. The house was even darker now, and she’d forgotten the way. </p><p>His growl came from farther back, and she heard him shout, “Hermione!”</p><p>“Fuck,” she gasped and she picked up the pace. Finally, she came to the foyer and reached the base of the sweeping staircase. She reminded herself that he couldn’t see her, so she quickly cast another silencing charm on her feet and took to the stairs. If she could make it to the door of the butler’s pantry, she could take the stairway out of the house and apparate home.</p><p>That didn’t help her much, however, since he’d somehow already detected her presence.</p><p>That was <em> not </em>good, as she had no real explanation for her presence there.</p><p>“Stop running, little witch!” he called after her.</p><p>She didn’t stop. She made her way up the stairs in the dark and tore down the hallway as if the hounds of hell were on her heels. </p><p>She ripped open the door which she thought led to the butler’s pantry, but quickly realized she’d made a mistake. Hermione found herself in a bedroom instead. Her chest heaved as she attempted to catch her breath. </p><p><em> Shit, </em> she thought. His footsteps echoed down the hallway, and she knew she was trapped. Again, she tried to apparate, but found she could not.</p><p>She stayed very still. She heard the click of his shoes against the hardwood floors. He passed by the doorway to the room she was in, and his footsteps echoed further down the hall. Then, she heard the slam of a door further down the hallway. </p><p>She decided to take her chance, and ripped open the door, only to collide with his chest.</p><p>“Going somewhere, darling?”</p><p>His arms encircled her like bands of iron and threw her back against the wall of the hallway. She could see very little in the dark save the blur of his white mask, a ghostly specter hovering above her. </p><p>Her heart was beating out of her chest. She knew he could feel it with his chest pressed against her breasts.</p><p>“I can taste your fear, little witch.” His voice sounded thinner, a preternatural quality reverberating in his tone. She shivered as she struggled against him.</p><p>He ripped the invisibility cloak off of her.</p><p>“Where did you get this?”</p><p>“Let me go, Tom!”</p><p>He chuckled. The sound was pure evil.</p><p>“I don’t think so, little Gryffindor. You’re quite brave, entering a den of serpents. I would even venture to say it borders on stupidity. Tell me, should I sink my fangs into you?” His eyes glowed red, the brightest she’d ever seen them. “I know how wet you get when I bite. The harder the better, right?”</p><p>“Fuck you,” she gritted, and then she stamped her heel down hard on his foot, eliciting a fierce curse from his lips. Then, she brought her knee up sharply and connected with his groin.</p><p>He doubled over and groaned.</p><p>She took her chance, freeing herself from his grasp as she ripped the invisibility cloak from his hands and darted down the hallway.</p><p>She chose the correct door and sped through the butler’s pantry, then threw open the door and flew down the stairs. </p><p>To her dismay, his footsteps padded behind her. </p><p>“Hermione, stop! For fuck’s sake!” he growled.</p><p>She pointed her wand behind her with no particular aim and shot a tripping jinx at him. It missed the mark and she cursed internally.</p><p>He shot two spells at her, both of which flew by her in bright flashes of blue and red light.</p><p>“Your aim is shit!” she taunted as she ran towards the woods behind the mansion.</p><p>“So is yours, you little cunt!”</p><p>“I wasn’t even aiming, <em> asshole </em>,” she huffed.</p><p>“Stop running, Hermione,” he commanded. His voice sounded dangerously close. “I’m not going to hurt you!”</p><p>“You’re a fucking liar!” she shrieked angrily.</p><p>She heard him exhale sharply in frustration, then his footsteps sped up.</p><p>“<em>Incarcerous! </em>” he spat. </p><p>Hermione turned on her heel just in time to block his curse with her shield. </p><p>They each stopped and stood facing one another, chests heaving. </p><p>Rage filled Hermione. Despite vowing to never use the curse again, she felt the spell fall from her lips before she’d even realized she uttered it. “<em>Sectumsempra! </em>”</p><p>He blocked it easily. </p><p>She couldn’t read his expression with the mask on, but he cocked his head as if to say, ‘Oh really?’</p><p>Suddenly, they were both throwing a volley of spells at one another. Hermione had <em> never </em>had to block so quickly. Riddle cast with snake-like swiftness, his wand whipping back and forth viciously. She shielded breathlessly, but still managed to cast a few spells in the same instant. </p><p>Despite her ability to both block and cast, he displayed use of the same technique. He’d clearly been training himself in the art of bi-casting since her duel with Walburga. He was now as proficient in the skill as Hermione was. She wished now that she hadn’t shown him that particular ability so soon.</p><p>
<em> “Levicorpus!”  </em>
</p><p>Riddle blocked her spell and sent a stunner. Hermione shielded, then shouted <em> “Diffindo!” </em></p><p>She managed to slice off a portion of his cloak. “<em>Expelliarmus!” </em></p><p>He blocked her disarming spell. “<em>Hermione</em>.” He said it sternly, as if it were a warning.</p><p>“Fuck you!” She threw a stinging jinx at him.</p><p>Tom blocked her jinx but cast a slicing hex at her, ripping her leggings and slicing open her leg. She glanced down and gasped in anger. </p><p>
<em> “Crucio!” </em>
</p><p>He sidestepped her torture curse deftly but laughed in his deep tenor. “Is my little witch getting angry?”</p><p>Her face twisted with rage and hatred, and she advanced on him, drawing her blade.</p><p>She closed the space between them in seconds, but he didn’t back away, nor did he raise his wand against her.</p><p>He let her lift the blade to his throat. Her adrenaline was pumping, and she pressed the blade roughly against his adam’s apple. It bit into his skin, drawing blood.</p><p>She raised her hand and ripped his mask away. </p><p>His red eyes gleamed with both amusement and anger, a smirk playing on his perfect lips. “Do it, little witch.”</p><p>Her chest heaved. “I hate you.”</p><p>He smiled devilishly, flashing his bright white teeth. “You hate me almost as much as you love me.”</p><p>She shook her head. “I don’t love you. I’m going to kill you.”</p><p>He leaned into her knife. “Then do it.”</p><p>Her eyes searched his face. He appeared slightly paler now, and his red eyes had dark circles beneath them. He was still handsome, and he was still Tom, but just… less human, and more… something <em> else </em>.</p><p>His eyes narrowed. “You can’t. It’s been your plan all along, hasn't it? But you can’t do it.”</p><p>She gripped the knife tighter, shoving it against his throat. “It’s what you deserve. You <em> murdered </em>that man!”</p><p>He reached up and grabbed her wrist, pulling it away from his throat as he wrested the blade from her grip. “He was a criminal, little witch. Vermin of the worst kind. He <em>deserved </em>it, Hermione.”</p><p>“No one deserves that kind of death!” Tears sprung from her eyes against her will.</p><p>His expression twisted into one of fury. “Your problem, little witch, is that you believe what you want to believe, instead of listening to the truth when I speak it.”</p><p>She shook her head. “All you speak are <em>lies</em>. You manipulate people. You’ve done <em> nothing </em> but manipulate me!”</p><p>He laughed, eyes snapping in anger. “You speak of lies and manipulation when you’re the most fluent liar I know, Hermione. You keep your secrets and you tell the world how much you despise me, yet you come to me every night. Who’s the manipulator here?”</p><p>“I <em> do </em> despise you! That is <em> not </em>a lie.”</p><p>His hand shot out and his long fingers grasped her throat, snatching her against him. He said nothing, but his eyes roved her face, searching her expression for a hint of the truth. His eyes fell to her lips, and for a moment, she thought he might kiss her. </p><p>“How did you know about Riddle House, Hermione?”</p><p>Hermione gritted her teeth, her fingers grasping at his hand in an attempt to pry his fingers from her throat. “I won’t tell you anything. Not anymore.”</p><p>His eyes narrowed. “Don’t make me use legilimency... <em>baby </em>.”</p><p>Her mouth fell open, eyes widening in fury. She spat in his face. “Do it. You <em> won’t</em>.”</p><p>He smirked fiendishly, wiping her spit from his cheek. “Wrong answer, <em> darling </em>.”</p><p>His eyes bore into hers and suddenly, he was penetrating her mental blockade like a pickaxe driving into granite. His attack shattered her defenses effortlessly and she screamed as a knifelike pain shot through her skull. She tried to employ the tactics Dumbledore had taught her, but his onslaught was too swift and too brutal. Her head felt split in half by the force of his entry. </p><p>He was rifling through her memories with torturous precision. She’d spent months occluding her most important memories to the depths of her consciousness, but the ones she’d left remaining were bare to his gaze. </p><p>She diverted him and occluded, but he was swift.</p><p>Then, she felt it. A slight opening in his mental walls. She remembered what Dumbledore had taught her: the best defense is a good offense. Hermione shoved forward with all of her mental capacity, diving into Riddle’s mind and forcing him to relinquish his hold on her mind.</p><p>The first memory she happened upon was recent. </p><p>
<em> Tom was in Slughorn’s office, and they were brewing a potion.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> “There is a witch, sir.” A feeling of warmth flooded Hermione, a sharp, overwhelming sense of intense possession. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Oh, but that’s wonderful, Tom! Who is the lucky witch?” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “We are keeping things private… for now.” </em>
</p><p>Hermione felt confusion, but Tom pushed her out, fighting against her invasion, so she searched until she fell upon another memory.</p><p>
<em> He was in a muggle jewelry shop, picking up a piece of jewelry. He held it up to the light, revealing a delicate golden phoenix with a silver snake coiling itself around it. </em>
</p><p>Tom successfully shoved her out of that memory, so she grasped for the next. She hoped she could maybe even find where he’d hid his journal, if she dug deep enough.</p><p>She pushed deeper into his mind, toward the black obsidian walls at the center of his consciousness. To her surprise, they parted easily. </p><p>She sifted through memories of his time at Hogwarts, of time spent researching in the library.</p><p>She paused on another memory. </p><p>
<em> Riddle sat in the dark of his flat, running his hands over his face, his fingers through his hair. There was severe anxiety and turmoil, and tension roiling through his body. He clawed at his own skin. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Come to me, Hermione. Stop running and come to me.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> She ached with hunger and desperation and the need to possess. The intensity of the feeling was so alien to Hermione that she knew it must be Riddle’s own emotion she was experiencing. </em>
</p><p>She touched on another memory.</p><p>
<em> Riddle hauled back and punched Alphard Black square in the nose. </em>
</p><p>She was quickly pushed out of that memory. Hermione began to wonder if he was controlling what she was seeing. His inner defenses had crumbled too easily for her comfort.</p><p>She dove deeper, and a memory bloomed before her.</p><p>
<em>Riddle was much younger, and he was with Walburga Black. They stood in the shower of the Slytherin dormitories, naked, and his hand pressed the side of her face into the cold shower wall. </em>
</p><p>
<em>His face twisted into one of disdain as he muttered in her ear, “How does it feel to be a whore for a half-blood? How easily you threw aside your ideals for my cock. You know that makes you a slut, right?”</em>
</p><p>
<em>Walburga nodded breathlessly, moaning as Tom drove into her.</em>
</p><p>Hermione’s chest ached, disgust coursing through her. She didn’t want to see him with <em> her </em>. </p><p>She couldn’t explain what bothered her about the scene. She’d known about their relationship. Had she expected him to be a virgin? A saint? She didn’t know why she had believed him to be above carnal desires.</p><p>It bothered her to see him fulfilling those desires with Walburga, of all people. A girl obsessed with blood purity, clinging to outdated, bigoted views designed to feed none other than her own superiority complex.</p><p>Sirius’ mother, the one who had cast her own son from the family callously. </p><p>She hated seeing his brutal thrusts into such a woman. Over and over, it just wouldn’t stop. She was desperate to leave the memory. </p><p>She hated herself for being upset by this scene.</p><p>To her relief, the memory jumped forward. She was glad not to have to see him finish.</p><p>
<em>Bruises painted Walburga’s body as he lifted his wand to her temple and breathlessly muttered, “Obliviate.”</em>
</p><p>A new scene began to bloom before her. She tried to break out of his control, to continue to rifle through his memories, but his hold on her consciousness was too strong. It was as she had feared; he had trapped her in her own attempt at Legilimency and now she was a prisoner in his mind.  </p><p><em> Let go </em> , she begged. This must be his way of punishing her for her attempt to break into his thoughts. <em> Let me go </em>.</p><p>But the memory persisted. To her absolute horror, she was viewing herself.</p><p>
<em>She stood at Tom’s side, wearing the same cloak and mask that he’d worn that night. Hermione felt immense power coursing through her body, like an electric current flowing over her skin and beating through her veins. </em>
</p><p>She knew this wasn’t a memory. Perhaps it was his fantasy? Was it something he had imagined before? </p><p>Why was he allowing her to see it now?</p><p>
<em>Tom took her hand and led her out onto a grand balcony. As she looked down, there were thousands of faces below them, a sea of innumerable witches and wizards, cheering. Applauding.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Clapping for them .</em>
</p><p>
<em>Tom turned to her and ran his fingertips over the smooth mask covering her face. Their eyes locked. </em>
</p><p>
<em>“We are one, Hermione. Our souls are knitted together forever. My power is yours… and your soul is mine. Do this with me, Hermione. Together, we can do anything. You know it, don’t you? You know deep down that you’re my soulmate.”</em>
</p><p>Confusion flooded her. How could he know about that? Did he know about the reading she’d been given?</p><p>She tried to leave the fantasy, but he had her locked in his mind like a mouse in the sharp talons of a hawk.</p><p>This wizard was unspeakably powerful. She could feel his power in her body, and it felt electrifying. How was it possible for her to feel his power like this? </p><p>
<em>He pulled his mask off and then threw hers aside as well. “Can’t we take these off?” he murmured as he brushed her hair from her face. “Why must you wear a mask with me?”</em>
</p><p>
<em>Her chest tightened as she gazed into his eyes, which were no longer red, but had shifted back to black portals; they drew her in like a trance.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She heard his feverish whisper in her ear, and the sound of applause ringing behind her. “I need you, little witch. Give in. Be one with me. We can ascend high above this realm, like the gods that we are. You’ve been tied to me through every lifetime, and you deserve to be worshiped, Hermione. Let me be your wizard. Let me worship you.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>The vision and his words, combined with the power in her veins, was an intoxicating combination. Her mouth fell open and he took it, covering her mouth with his and thrusting his tongue against hers. </em>
</p><p>
<em>“Mine,” he whispered fiercely as he broke away.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Yours,” she murmured in reply. Everything else seemed to be forgotten in the moment. He held her in a rapturous trance, one she didn’t want to break free from. It felt too euphoric to be this way with him. </em>
</p><p>
<em>“You are mine, too, Tom,” she whispered. </em>
</p><p>
<em>He nodded, and ran his thumb over her bottom lip. “Every part, little witch.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>She turned her head, gazing down at the mass of people. He watched her as she observed the multitude. “We can create a new world, Hermione.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>She shook her head slowly. “Not your way, Tom. It’s wrong. Yours is the dream of a madman.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>He leaned down and whispered fervently, “Then let it be our way. Bind yourself to me and our fate will be tied. Everything I am and everything I have will be yours. We can craft our dreams together. I can help you to live forever.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>She swallowed. She knew that this was merely a dream, and that reality was much harsher and messier than what he envisioned for them. Still, the illusion was so beautiful that she lingered a moment longer. “I wish that I could trust you.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>His eyes narrowed. “Why can’t you? What is it that you won’t show me?” His fingertips traced her jawline. “I need to know. I have to know, Hermione… and I’m going to find out. Let me in, little witch. Show me who you really are."</em>
</p><p>Her eyes widened.</p><p>She tried to break free of his hold on her mental faculties.</p><p><em> Let me go! </em>She summoned all of her strength to break free from his imagination. Suddenly she was enveloped in darkness, like there were chains around her mind. Then she felt him pervading her like a sharp knife, penetrating her own mental walls. </p><p><em> No</em>, she thought with panic. She tried to erect her defenses, but she was too slow. Her head cracked with pain, and he began rifling through her memories once more.</p><p><em> NO</em>! She screamed internally, fighting and clawing against him to no avail. </p><p>She had always been told that he was an incredibly powerful and skilled Legilimens, but she had hoped it was a skill he had developed later in life. Clearly, it was a natural ability of his. Fear gripped her.</p><p>She couldn’t lose her cover. He would know she was lying about everything. Then, he would surely kill her. Just like he'd killed that muggle.</p><p>He pulled upon a memory from her fourth year. It was dark in the hall of Gryffindor tower. She used all of her strength to blur the sight of the portraits in the hallway. It was dark enough that he likely would not recognize the location, but she wouldn’t take the chance. </p><p>
<em>She was with Viktor Krum. </em>
</p><p>
<em>He kissed along her cheekbone, then her throat. His hands roamed her waist as his lips returned to hers. Her hair was slightly mussed, lips wet and red against Viktor’s.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She gave a breathy laugh. “It seems you are skilled at things besides Quidditch.” </em>
</p><p>
<em>Viktor’s eyes sparkled as he gave her a roguish grin. “See? Now you have no choice. You must come to the ball with me, Mione.” His Slavic accent was thick.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Hermione felt an alien emotion, cold anger, roiling in her gut. She could feel Tom’s hatred of the scene like a foreign entity. The memory cut short, as if tossed aside like a rotten apple.</em>
</p><p>A new memory surfaced. A recent one. <em><br/></em></p><p>
<em>She felt as if she were thawing, like ice. Harry held her hand, wrapping his arms around her in their tent. Ron was gone. Her heart hurt. Everything felt hopeless. </em>
</p><p>
<em>But she and Harry danced together. Two best friends, finding solace in one another, daring to hope for better. For happiness. For freedom. For peace .</em>
</p><p>She didn’t want him to see this memory.</p><p>She pushed him successfully out of that memory with every bit of force that she could muster. </p><p>He grabbed another memory and dove in roughly. Her head felt split in half. The memory was of Fenrir Greyback. He was presenting Harry, Ron, and Hermione to Bellatrix Lestrange. </p><p>She forced him out of the memory quickly, but he dove back in.</p><p>
<em>She was laying on the floor, pain ripping through her arm as Bellatrix screamed, carving an ‘M’ into her skin with a sharp blade. She faltered as she experienced the pain of the memory again, giving a short sob and feeling dangerously close to retching. </em>
</p><p>Sensing her distress, Tom finally let go and pulled out of her mind.</p><p>She stumbled, almost falling to her knees before he caught her around the middle.</p><p>“Hermione,” he rasped. “What’s this? What are you not telling me?”</p><p>She sank to her knees with a choked sob. Her limbs shook with the force of the trauma she’d revisited, if only for a brief moment. She clutched at her temples, the searing pain of his invasion threatening to explode her brain. </p><p>He waved his wand and a soothing liquid sensation melted the tension away.</p><p>“Who is the woman that did that to you, Hermione? Who is she? Who are those people?”</p><p>She shook, but said nothing. </p><p>He gripped her arms and pulled her to her feet. “Tell me now. I’m not asking.” </p><p>Hermione slipped her blade from her thigh and slashed at his shoulder.</p><p>“Fuck, witch!” he gritted through clenched teeth, grasping at his bleeding shoulder.</p><p>Hermione took off running. She couldn’t let him back into her mind; he was coming far too close to the truth for her comfort. She should be able to apparate if she reached the treeline.</p><p>Suddenly, flames erupted in front of her. She skidded to a halt and whirled around, but realized she was trapped in a fiery ring. Flames encircled her, leaving her no way out.</p><p>“No!” she screamed. Just as she was about to attempt apparation again, she looked up to find Tom leaping over the flames. </p><p>No, he wasn’t leaping.</p><p>He was <em> flying</em>.</p><p>Terror gripped her, and for the first time she realized that she had deeply underestimated Riddle’s abilities.</p><p>She’d assumed he had gained his magical strength later in life, but that clearly wasn’t the case.</p><p>He was born this way; a force of unparalleled power. It was in his blood.</p><p>But she was also a force, she reminded herself, and a muggleborn one at that.</p><p>He landed on the grass beside her, a dark figure silhouetted against the flames, a phantom emerging from the darkness like the devil himself.</p><p>He grabbed her and pulled her to him. “Stop <em> fucking </em>running from me.”</p><p>Hermione lifted her blade but he snatched at her wrist, holding it away from him. “Stop this, Hermione! Tell me everything.”</p><p>She shook her head. “<em>Never</em>.”</p><p>His face twisted with anger and he jerked his head in frustration. “You leave me no choice.”</p><p>She struggled like a rabid animal, but he easily overpowered her. “Don't do this, Tom. I will <em> never </em> forgive you.” Tears escaped her eyes and ran down her cheeks. “Is <em> nothing </em>sacred to you?”</p><p>He pulled her against him, forcing her to look into his eyes. “<em>You </em> are sacred to me. Why can't you see it?”</p><p>Hermione’s heart thundered in her chest, and with their bodies pressed so tightly together, she felt his pounding as well. They stood in silence, surrounded by the ring of licking flames.</p><p>The energy between them crackled. The tension and attraction was so thick that it was almost painful. </p><p>He seemed to be warring within himself. Hermione knew that if he decided to penetrate her mind again, there was nothing she could do to stop him. Her defenses were weakened and drained now.</p><p>She gazed into his eyes, pleading silently.</p><p>Suddenly, there was a piercing cry that rang out through the night. Hermione knew the sound.</p><p>Her eyebrows knitted in confusion. The sound… It reminded her of the cry of Fawkes. Dumbledore’s phoenix.</p><p>Both of them lifted their gazes to the sky, and to Hermione’s utter shock, a phoenix was diving directly toward them. </p><p>She took advantage of Tom’s momentary surprise and yanked herself out of his arms. They observed the flight of the phoenix as it blazed a fiery trail toward them.</p><p>This bird wasn’t Fawkes. The colors were too different. Where Fawkes was a deep red, this phoenix was golden. Its tail was lit with bright orange flames and it beat its wings rapidly, plunging toward Hermione. Its wingspan was enormous.</p><p>Hermione smiled and lifted her hand; the bird descended and the instant her fingers grasped its tail, she disappeared with a resounding crack and a spark of golden flames.</p><p> </p>

<h2 class="heading">Revelation</h2>
</div>

<div class="userstuff">
<p> </p><p>Hermione lay in bed that night, the events of the evening replaying over and over in her head. Who was the man he had murdered? Had Tom really absorbed the power of an ancient, long-dead wizard?</p><p>She couldn’t stop re-imagining the vision she’d seen in Riddle’s head. She didn’t need to ask what it was. She already knew. It was his own dream for them.</p><p>He dreamed of a future with her.</p><p><em>That’s because he doesn’t know the truth,</em> she told herself. </p><p>If he did, he would kill her.</p><p>A tear rolled down her face and fell to her pillow. She had owled Dumbledore before getting into bed. She had no family here; in truth, she felt like she had no one. Only Albus.</p><p>She needed to see him. Not only because she needed him, but because she now had a fully grown phoenix in her sitting room and she had no idea what to do with it.</p><p>A phoenix had come to her.</p><p>Not Harry. Not Dumbledore. Her. </p><p>Not Fawkes, but her very own phoenix.</p><p>She wanted to think about that, but she couldn’t. All she could think about was Riddle.</p><p>
<em> “You are sacred to me. Why can’t you see it?” </em>
</p><p>His words rang in her ears.</p><p>Hermione’s chest ached. She missed him lying next to her.</p><p>He hadn’t come to her, and she was glad of it. Perhaps he had known she didn’t want him here. Perhaps he was angry with her. Whatever the reason, she was grateful for small mercies.</p><p>She couldn’t see him tonight, for fear that she would crumble.</p><p>Tomorrow, she decided she would be hardened steel. But tonight, she could only weep and ache.</p><p>He was destroying himself with dark magic.</p><p>One day, he would be beyond recognition. </p><p>For the first time, it occurred to Hermione that Riddle might not even <em> know </em>how the dark magic was truly affecting him. What if she were to show him what he would become? Would that alter his course?</p><p>“I cannot change him,” she whispered.</p><p>She missed his scent, and she missed his clothes neatly folded on his chair; the way he always woke before her.</p><p>
<em> “We can create a new world, Hermione. We can craft our dreams together.” </em>
</p><p>How could that be possible? When their dreams were so drastically opposite?</p><p>Part of her wanted to run. So far away that he could never find her. But the instant she thought about it, she felt repulsed. She had already gone on the run once from Voldemort. She’d already upended her life for him once. This was her life now, and she wouldn’t run from him again. She would stay and face him. </p><p>Her leg ached where his slicing hex had caught her thigh. She’d closed it back up and rubbed it with Dittany, but the ache was still there, fresh and raw.</p><p>
<em> “Everything I am and everything I have will be yours.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Mine.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Let me worship you, Hermione.” </em>
</p><p>His cavernous voice echoed in her mind, his words repeating over and over again as sleep evaded her. </p><p>She reached into the drawer by her bed and withdrew an Elixir of Euphoria and a Dreamless Sleep potion. She downed them both.</p><p>Within minutes, both potions began to work their magic. </p><p>As she drifted into the arms of Morpheus, it struck Hermione that things would be different now. She wasn’t sure how, or <em> what </em>would be different… she only knew that there was no way they could return to the way things had been.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Hermione woke to the sound of pounding. </p><p>It took her several minutes to rise out of the grip of the Dreamless Sleep potion. She looked around, acclimating herself to her surroundings. </p><p>Then, it all came rushing back in a flood of pain and grief.</p><p>She sighed and fell back against her pillow. The sun peeked in through her curtains, a sign that she had overslept. </p><p>But what was that <em> pounding </em>?</p><p>She rose and threw her legs over the side of the bed. As she opened her bedroom door, the pounding grew louder.</p><p>Then, she heard his voice.</p><p>“Hermione, open this damn door before I blow it to smithereens.”</p><p>It was Tom.</p><p>
<em> Shit. </em>
</p><p>Hermione swallowed. She hadn’t even had time to process everything that happened, much less to come up with an explanation for her presence at Riddle House last night. Did she even trust him enough to let him into her flat now?</p><p>“<em> Hermione </em>,” came his ominous tone.</p><p>There was nothing for it. She knew he would break down the door if she didn’t let him in. Dumbledore would be there soon, so she relented and whipped open the door.</p><p>Tom stood there, eyes sharp and jaw tense. As soon as she opened the door, his gaze fell to her skimpy nightgown. It was quite warm in her flat, so she hadn’t realized there was a chill in the air. The cool air hit her skin like an icy blast from the hallway, and her skin pebbled with gooseflesh. His eyes raked over the thin spaghetti straps and then trailed down her body to linger on the bandaged wound on her thigh. </p><p>His eyes flicked back up to hers.</p><p>“Can I come in?”</p><p>She glared at him, shocked by his nerve. </p><p>She said nothing, but stood back and allowed him to enter.</p><p>He stood in the foyer, staring at her with a masked expression. Dark magic rolled off of him like smoke flowing off of dry ice. She smoothed her hair self-consciously. </p><p>“What do you want, Tom?”</p><p>He blinked once. Then twice. His eyes narrowed. “What do you<em> fucking mean </em>? Did you think I wouldn’t want to talk about last night? Are you mental?”</p><p>She swallowed. “What’s there to talk about?”</p><p>He cocked his head in a snake-like movement. His eyes were no longer red as they were last night; he seemed to be able to change the color of them at will. Still, the change in his appearance was shocking. He was paler. It wasn’t so much his physical attributes that had changed, but his movements. His presence carried an atmosphere of shadow and dread.</p><p>He looked at her as if he were seeing her for the first time. She couldn’t decipher his mood.</p><p>“Why were you at Riddle House, Hermione? And <em> how </em>did you even know of its existence?”</p><p>Hermione was quiet.</p><p>“I think you owe me answers.”</p><p>She stared at him incredulously, eyes wide. She crossed her arms over her chest. “I owe you nothing.”</p><p>Tom took a step forward, eyes snapping with anger. “No? You owe me nothing? That’s good then, because you have given me nothing. You fight me publicly and all the while, everyone is wondering why I haven’t fucking dealt with you yet. You refuse to tell me anything about who you are or where you’ve really come from-“</p><p>Hermione took a step forward. Her chest ached terribly. “I’ve given you more of myself than you’ve <em> ever </em>deserved.”</p><p>Tom glared at her with something akin to hatred. “You know what I find funny, Hermione? You were so worried at first that you were just another piece of ass for me, but now I’m starting to wonder if all I am to you is a dick appointment.”</p><p>Hermione gazed at him in shock. “<em>Excuse me</em>, asshole, but I have no shortage of wizards in line for my attention if, <em> indeed</em>, all I wanted was a <em> dick appointment </em>. But I’m glad to know you think that lowly of me, Tom.”</p><p>He laughed bitterly. “You’re so humble, too.”</p><p>Her tone was biting and caustic as she murmured, “Yes, well, I do typically go around offering my virginity to random wizards just for the fun of it.”</p><p>Tom took a deep breath. He ran his fingers through his inky black hair. “Alright, then. Point taken. So why do you refuse to let me in? Either you trust me, or you don’t.”</p><p>She shook her head. “I don’t trust you. I can’t… <em> ever </em>. Last night just proves that.”</p><p>He cocked his head, eyes narrowing murderously. “Oh really? Why? Because I didn’t tell you where I was going or what I was doing? Because I ‘murdered’ someone? You think you know me, but you know <em> nothing </em> . You don’t think I’d tell you things if this were a real relationship and not the fucking comedy that it is? You tell me <em> nothing</em>, and yet you think you’re somehow entitled to <em> my </em> secrets? <em> Fuck </em>you, Hermione.”</p><p>Tears flooded her eyes unbidden. “How… how could you just kill that man, Tom?” Her voice cracked. “What happened to you in life to make you so cruel?”</p><p>He stepped forward until she was staring at his chest. She fell back against the wall of the foyer. “If you’d seen the inside of that man’s mind and witnessed the things he’s done, you’d need a mind healer. You’d be begging me to obliviate you.” </p><p>“And I’m supposed to believe that?”</p><p>His eyes were cold. “I don’t care what you believe.” He scoffed, shaking his head. “You dare to call me cruel. Have I ever been cruel to you, Hermione?”</p><p>She said nothing. </p><p>He drew nearer, pressing her into the wall. He placed his hands on either side of her, trapping her between his arms. “I suppose a healthy fear is good. Although, if you’d just be truthful, you’d have nothing to fear from me.”</p><p>She shook her head. “I’ll never trust you.”</p><p>His eyes sparked with cold anger as they roved her face. He reached out and gripped her cheeks, then squeezed them, forcing her lips apart. “You drive me fucking crazy,” he breathed.</p><p>He leaned down and kissed her. </p><p>Hermione’s brain short-circuited. </p><p>Hadn’t she planned to be hardened steel today? </p><p>His tongue slid between her lips and his scent flooded her mind, sending a shockwave of hunger through her body. </p><p>Her mind fought, but her body refused to obey. When his hand snaked around her waist and he pulled her tighter, she melted into him. Dark magic licked at her skin, causing her to shiver.</p><p>She pushed weakly against his chest, breaking the kiss. “No,” she whispered shakily. His jaw tensed. He didn’t move away, but released his breath slowly, as if he were forcing himself to remain calm.</p><p>“I don’t like it when you tell me no,” he said slowly.</p><p>She gazed at him for a moment, then leaned forward and whispered against his ear, “<em>No</em>.”</p><p>The muscles in his jaw tightened. He glared at her as she pulled away.</p><p>“Who was the woman torturing you, Hermione?”</p><p>Her heart rate skyrocketed. “It doesn’t matter.”</p><p>He ejected a frustrated breath. “Are you an Unspeakable?”</p><p>She shook her head slowly. “No, Tom.”</p><p>His head jerked angrily. “Then why can’t you tell me? You beg me not to look into your mind and yet you’re concealing things like this from me. What else would I find in your memories? How do you expect me <em> not </em>to use legilimency on you? I must be a fucking fool.”</p><p>Hermione’s lip trembled. She was on the verge of breaking. “You are asking too much of me, Tom."</p><p>Tom shook his head, disbelieving. “No, Hermione,” he said acidly as he pointed at her. “<em>You </em> are asking too much of <em> me </em>.”</p><p>Her anger snapped. “Do you seriously think I <em> relish </em>being the girlfriend of an aspiring Dark Lord? Do you think that was my childhood dream? While the other little girls were off dreaming of Prince Charming, I was dreaming of being swept off my feet by a murderous dark wizard?”</p><p>He leaned in and whispered, “You are not my girlfriend, Hermione. You never will be, unless you tell me the truth.” Tom withdrew and looked down at her coldly, his jaw muscles rippling as he grit his teeth. “How would you know what my aspirations are? You’ve never even bothered to ask me. Tell me, darling… How do you know about my death eaters? And how did you know about Riddle House? I’m not going to ask you again. Tell me now, Hermione. I am very close to losing my temper.”</p><p>She sighed, then thought it in her best interest to relent on this one thing. “I saw the note Abraxas sent. By owl.”</p><p>Tom stilled, eyes sharpening. “What note?”</p><p>“There was a note meant for you. The night I stayed at your flat.”</p><p>His head turned slightly. His eyes darkened with suspicion. “You have to be lying.”</p><p>“I’m not, Tom.”</p><p>Tom was frozen as he watched her, attempting to decipher whether she was lying. Hermione observed him in return. Tom was bathed in dark magic. His eyes had shifted from black to a blazing inferno of crimson. His movements were smooth and snake-like; it was terrifying to behold. He cocked his head as he looked down at her, and she couldn’t help feeling the hair on the back of her neck rise. He was like a snake preparing to strike. He almost seemed possessed by something other than himself.</p><p>Hermione stared up at him, not bothering to hide the fear in her eyes. “I wish you could see what you’re doing to yourself,” she whispered. </p><p>He reached up and brushed a curl from her cheek, tucking it behind her ear. His eyes twisted with something vaguely resembling pain. “Sometimes I really wish I’d never met you, Hermione.”</p><p>She swallowed. His statement felt like a serrated knife dragging through her chest. “Then perhaps we should pretend we didn’t, and go our separate ways.”</p><p>Tom smiled, a sinister stretching of his lips. Then, he laughed as he leaned into her. “It will never be that easy, little witch. It’s too late. It was too late the moment I laid eyes on you. You belong to me now, and you can never escape… no matter how far you try to run.” He looked at her and his expression was one of cold, unadulterated rage. “I will discover your secrets. It’s only a matter of time. Your walls are already crumbling.”</p><p>Hermione’s eyes snapped with rebellion. “You won’t discover anything if I’m gone.”</p><p>Tom smiled and reached up to wrap his long fingers around her throat. “There’s something I don’t think you realize, Hermione. Though I want you just as you are… if I have to corrupt you to keep you, then I damn well will. You may have your hooks in me, witch, but I have a leash around your neck and good luck getting it off. I <em> dare </em>you to try to run from me.”</p><p>Hermione stared back at him for several moments, gazing into his red eyes. They were so like Voldemort’s now. Had she thought, somewhere deep inside of herself, that she alone could stop him from becoming that monster? How foolish that dream seemed now.</p><p>Suddenly, there was a knock at the door. Tom’s eyes narrowed and he flicked his gaze to Hermione. </p><p>“It’s Dumbledore,” she breathed. </p><p>His eyes widened. “Are you serious? What’s he doing here?”</p><p>“I-“ she began, grimacing. “I asked him to come.”</p><p>His head cocked to the side. “Are you honestly <em> that </em>afraid of me?”</p><p>She shook her head. The knock came again. “We always meet on Sundays. I… I asked him to come because of the Phoenix.”</p><p>Realization dawned on his features. “The Phoenix… is it here?”</p><p>She nodded. </p><p>He looked toward the door. </p><p>“Dumbledore knows, Tom,” she whispered. </p><p>His head whipped back around to her. “He knows <em> what </em>?”</p><p>Her lips parted. “About us.”</p><p>His eyebrows lifted sharply. “You told him?”</p><p>She nodded. </p><p>“You didn’t think to mention that?”</p><p>She released a breath. “I don’t know, Tom, I forgot.”</p><p>He sighed and leaned his head back, running a hand over his face in irritation.</p><p>Hermione shoved him aside and went to open the door.</p><p>Dumbledore stood there in her hallway, garbed in a set of indigo robes. His eyes took in Hermione’s appearance, the thin nightgown, her unkempt hair, and the bandage on her thigh. Then, his eyes flicked over to Riddle and sharpened perceptibly. He stood in stoic silence.</p><p>“Please come in, Albus.”</p><p>Dumbledore walked in slowly, then stood observing the two of them.</p><p>Tom glanced at Hermione. </p><p>She looked back nervously.</p><p>His jaw jutted to the side and he muttered, “We’ll talk about this later.”</p><p>He walked toward the door but paused as he passed by Dumbledore. He looked his old professor in the eye as he muttered coolly, “Headmaster.”</p><p>Dumbledore inclined his head in acknowledgement.</p><p>Then, Riddle left.</p><p>Hermione closed the door behind him.</p><p>It was quiet for several moments.</p><p>“Albus-“</p><p>“Let’s see the Phoenix.”</p><p>She took a deep breath, somewhat relieved. “Right.”</p><p>Hermione led him into the sitting room. There, on the back of her sofa, sat a sleeping Phoenix.</p><p>Dumbledore approached the bird. His eyes sparkled as he ran his hand over the feathers on the phoenix’s back. It started awake, then let out a soft, contented cawing sound.</p><p>“I’ve never seen a phoenix with this coloring before,” Dumbledore mused. While Fawkes was a deep scarlet red with a golden breast, Hermione’s phoenix possessed the inversion of those colors. Its feathers were bright gold which transformed to a brilliant red at its breast.</p><p>“I believe,” Dumbledore observed, “She is a female.”</p><p>“Really?” Hermione’s eyes widened. “Where did she come from?”</p><p>Dumbledore smiled. “One of the great mysteries of the universe. There’s no way of knowing for sure. But she is yours now. I don’t know if you’re aware of this… but it has always been believed in my family that a phoenix will always come to the aid of any Dumbledore facing great peril. Perhaps the creature is tied to the magical roots of our family. In any case… I think you may take this as a sign. You are a true Dumbledore now. This turn of events… it’s incredibly remarkable, Hermione. I confess to being shocked… and it takes a great deal to surprise me nowadays.” </p><p>Hermione ran her fingers over the bird’s feathers. The phoenix’s eyes squinted happily.</p><p>Dumbledore eyed Hermione searchingly. “For some months, I pondered whether your arrival here in this time was simply a terrible twist of fate. But I’m beginning to believe that you were always meant to come here.”</p><p>Hermione swallowed. “I fear I’m making a terrible mess of it, Albus.”</p><p>Dumbledore smiled. “What I’ve found over the years, Hermione, is that fate comes to our aid despite our own mistakes and digressions. Trust in your instincts, my dear. The universe will always work for the good of those who live for love and light. You may be on the correct path, and not even realize it.”</p><p>Hermione gave him a wry smile. “I wish I believed that.”</p><p>Albus looked pointedly at the phoenix. “Did you know that for many millennia, the phoenix has been a symbol of hope, renewal, and resurrection? Though they perish in flame, they are reborn from the ashes. A rare and immortal creature. If anything should be a sign to you that the impossible is, indeed, <em> possible </em>… this beautiful phoenix would most certainly be it.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>On Sunday evening, Tom sat in his armchair in front of the fireplace in his flat, smoking a cigarette and reading about trace magic. He needed to distract himself.</p><p>He’d decided he wouldn’t go back to Hermione’s flat tonight. He would give her space, because although he couldn’t be sure <em> how </em>exactly he knew it, he sensed that she was on the verge of breaking.</p><p>He took a drag from his cigarette. Smoke clouded the space around him as he contemplated their conversation that morning.</p><p>A note, said his little witch.</p><p>He did not ever communicate with his Death Eaters via owl.</p><p>Either she was lying, or his followers were hiding something.</p><p>But of all his Death Eaters… <em> Abraxas </em>? </p><p>Malfoy was the last person Tom would suspect to plot behind his back.</p><p>Unless it wasn’t Malfoy who wrote the note.</p><p>He’d been consistently reading their minds, but he was well aware that there were ways around even legilimency.</p><p>Perhaps they had been making use of obliviation… and if so, Tom knew how to remedy that. He could reverse obliviation with little effort.</p><p>Tom vowed to be more observant of them from now on. He had always been compulsively suspicious, and Hermione had planted a seed of doubt in his mind that had no outlet but to germinate within him.</p><p>Tom thought of Dumbledore’s penetrating stare.</p><p>How <em> fascinating… </em>Hermione had a phoenix, just like her father.</p><p>He thought of the necklace which she still wore around her neck. Tom smirked. So! His witch had a pet phoenix and he had a pet basilisk. How perfectly picturesque. </p><p>She was a Dumbledore, after all. There could be no doubt about that now, right?</p><p>He’d always hated Dumbledore growing up. Once upon a time, he’d admired him, but the professor had never looked at him with anything but suspicion and distrust.</p><p>Now, Tom was railing his daughter. He couldn’t help but bask in the feeling of triumph; it was clear from Dumbledore’s reaction this morning that the older wizard wasn’t happy about it. </p><p>The old man would have to get over it. </p><p>Hermione was his.</p><p>Tom’s thoughts drifted to the woman he’d seen torturing Hermione. She’d appeared to be mad, absolutely <em> feral </em>as she carved something into Hermione’s arm. Tom had never seen any marks or scarring on her skin. Had she placed concealment charms? If so, why hadn’t he noticed?</p><p>Tom vowed that once he discovered the identity of the woman, he would carve Hermione’s name into her cheek and hack off her wand arm. A wave of euphoria flooded through Tom as he imagined torturing the woman incessantly. He hated her. The emotion was irrational and animalistic. All he saw was Hermione’s face twisted with anguish and the shrill sound of her screams, high-pitched and visceral. </p><p>Tom was filled with rage. He would make that hag choke on her own organs before he ended her.</p><p>His thoughts wandered to the sight of Hermione in her nightgown, and the bandage over the cut on her thigh. Tom smirked, rubbing at his shoulder, which was still sore from where she had sliced it open with her blade. He couldn’t make sense of why the sight of her marred by his curse turned him on.</p><p>He re-lived their kiss that morning. Tom thought of the way she’d melted against him, despite her obvious distrust of him.</p><p>Despite everything she’d witnessed the night before.</p><p>“You’re mine,” he breathed. </p><p>He heard her voice, rasping huskily in his ear as she whispered, “<em> No </em>.”</p><p>He felt himself growing hard.</p><p>The more she fought him, the more he wanted to ruin her.</p><p>“You’re not safe, little witch,” he breathed. He sucked in oxygen through his cigarette, filling his lungs with smoke. “You aren’t safe at all from me.”</p><p>Suddenly, Tom’s eyes narrowed. He had a feeling which had been building for several minutes, a vague and nonspecific inkling that something was <em> off </em>.</p><p>He sat and pressed into the faint sense of unrest until it grew and began to grate at him like an itch.</p><p>This was not one of his compulsions. This was something else.</p><p>It was a dark sense of foreboding, permeated by overwhelming sadness and hopelessness and <em> guilt </em>. It was not an emotion that Tom was familiar with, and his brow furrowed in surprise. </p><p>He somehow began to intuit that Hermione was unwell. He wasn’t sure how he knew it. Part of him wondered if he was simply overthinking. Perhaps it was his own sense of regret over the way in which the events of last night had transpired.</p><p>But no… he had never felt this before. It could not be coming from him; he had no capacity for this acute level of emotion. </p><p>He swallowed, then breathed in the smoke from his cigarette. It returned to his mind suddenly, the passage he had read about twin flame connections. The transmitting of emotions through the aureatic centers of the magical core. </p><p>Suddenly, he stood and put out his cigarette. </p><p>He walked, quickly and purposefully, to his bedroom and began to etch the protective runes into his floor. His movements were jerky and raw. </p><p>Then, with a tensing of his jaw, he fell back onto his bed and cast his soul from his body. He flew through the night at lightning speed until he stood at the door to her flat.</p><p>Tom knew that this was an invasion of her privacy. He stood before the door for some minutes, at war with himself.</p><p>If he was going to invade her privacy, mightn’t he just go ahead and perform legilimency and be done with it? She would hate him for it, but at least he would know the truth of who she was and where she’d come from. Her secrets were starting to eat Tom alive.</p><p>But yet, some sliver of Tom’s consciousness told him to wait. To bide his time. To let her secrets come to him. </p><p>He regretted the use of legilimency last night.</p><p>He rarely ever regretted his actions.</p><p>The witch had already surrendered her body to him. Soon, he would have her soul, and with it, her secrets as well. He wanted her to <em> give </em> him her truths. Every hidden thing; the darkest reaches of her soul, her fears, and her past. For the first time in Tom’s life, he didn’t want to take something brutally, by force. </p><p>The taste of taking from her was bitter. </p><p>
<em> “Is nothing sacred to you?” </em>
</p><p>No. He would wait, no matter how painful.</p><p>Eventually, the sweetness of her surrender would taste like honey.</p><p>Tom stared at the door to her flat. The persistent pricking of his premonitions chafed at Tom. He wouldn’t be able to study or sleep tonight if he didn’t discover what it was that had her emotions in such a state of despondency. Something was off.</p><p>Something was <em> wrong </em>.</p><p>He passed through the door. </p><p>Tom gazed about him; her flat was dark.</p><p>Her house elf was nowhere to be found, either. Perhaps it was her day off.</p><p>Had his witch gone out tonight? </p><p>A single lamp was lit in the corner by her desk in the great room. Tom crossed the room and examined the broad desk.</p><p>She had books strewn about the table and many parchments. Some were hers, littered with notes, and there were various documents. Some bore the seal of the Ministry; others appeared to be scrolls from the magical library in Diagon Alley. Her quill lay across the paper and the ink was still wet. </p><p>Tom then heard the music drifting from another room.</p><p>She was here.</p><p>Tom noticed a letter sitting on the far end of the desk; it must have been delivered today. </p><p>The top half of the letter was obscured by an open book, but the latter half appeared to be an invitation to a Ministry event. The inauguration. Not only was it an invitation, but the sender had asked to escort Hermione to the event. Irritation filled Tom. He craned his neck and saw the name signed at the bottom: <em> Gaspard Dufresne </em>.</p><p>Tom racked his brain. He knew that the name sounded familiar, but he couldn’t recall where he’d heard it. </p><p>It didn’t matter. He’d told Hermione that he didn’t care who she was seen with, or who she attended these kinds of events with… and it was true. Tom didn’t care. It was his bed she slept in at the end of the day. What else could matter, if that were the case? They had a sort of unspoken understanding that they wouldn’t be seen together in public. She’d promised to fight him. He didn’t blame her for that.</p><p>But it irked him that another wizard might show interest in his witch. <em> That </em> vexed him greatly.</p><p>Particularly as their relationship was on shaky ground since last night.</p><p>Tom saw his parchment on one side of the desk. It was unfurled and still displayed his last note. </p><p>For all appearances, it seemed as if she’d been working most of the evening.</p><p>The sky outside had darkened considerably with an impending storm. Thunder rumbled and the wood floor shook. The crystal drops on the lamp trembled.</p><p>Then he noticed it. There were three empty vials of some potion, scattered across the desk.</p><p>They looked to be the same vials he’d seen her take before.</p><p>His eyes narrowed.</p><p>He made his way down the hallway and stood before the door to her bedroom. The music drifted from within.</p><p>He floated through the door. </p><p>The room looked as it always did. In the center was a great four-poster canopy bed with silken sheets and a mountain of pillows; beside it was a little night table upon which there was a blue and teal glass Tiffany lamp. In one corner by the floor-to-ceiling windows was a little round breakfast table and a fireplace, in front of which sat two wingback chairs in which they often sat studying in the evenings when he visited. A fur rug graced the floor in front of the fireplace. He’d fucked her on it several nights prior. There weren’t many surfaces they hadn’t desecrated, truth be told.</p><p>There were countless boxes, all piled up against the walls and there were dresses upon dresses draped across the chairs. </p><p>Tom shook his head.</p><p>Such was the life of a socialite.</p><p>The music was coming from the strange phonograph-like box with a spinning disc he’d seen weeks ago. It was a mournful ballad, whose choir of voices drifted through the room as the thunder cracked outside.</p><p>
<em> Oh, children... Lift up your voice, lift up your voice... </em>
</p><p>He heard the sound of water running from behind the bathroom door. She was most likely showering.</p><p>He dragged his attention away from that fact, willing himself to give her privacy despite his overwhelming desire to watch the water dance across her skin. A movement caught his eye and he walked over to the bed.</p><p>Tom cocked his head.</p><p>On the bed, her little bag which she normally kept as a charm around her wrist was enlarged and sat on top of the coverlet, lying open. </p><p>There was another empty potion vial lying on the bed. That concerned Tom. He’d known for some time that she was overusing potions, but he hadn’t had the opportunity to broach the subject with her.</p><p>The little phoenix necklace she had typically worn before he’d given her the new one for her birthday sat on the bed beside three photographs. The first two were moving in the typical fashion of wizarding photographs. The last, however, was not.</p><p>Tom marveled at the clarity of the photos. </p><p>In the first, Hermione sat with a red-headed girl and another girl with pale blonde hair. They were in someone’s house and they were smiling. It looked to have been taken at Christmas; he saw stockings in the background hanging from the fireplace mantle. </p><p>In the second, a much younger Hermione sat between two young boys. One of the boys was thin and wore glasses and had dark, unruly hair. The other boy had red hair and was rather gangly looking. They were smiling and laughing. Hermione looked happy.</p><p>The third photo was a much, much younger Hermione. Perhaps she was eleven or twelve years old. Tom might not have even recognized her if it weren’t for her frizzy hair. She stood between an older woman and a man. They looked suspiciously like Hermione. Tom’s blood ran cold. The young witch who stood between them was holding something in her hands and grinning from ear to ear.</p><p>Tom knew <em> exactly </em> what was in her hands.</p><p>It was a Hogwarts letter.</p><p>Anger flooded Tom.</p><p>He looked back to the photograph of the two boys. Now that he looked at it more closely, he knew precisely where they were. He had only been there once or twice himself, but he recognized the coat of arms standing in the background. They sat on the floor of the Gryffindor common room.</p><p>Tom’s jaw tensed and his eyes flicked toward the door to the bathroom.</p><p>He’d known all along the witch had been lying. But now he had proof. Tom would have remembered her if she had gone to Hogwarts. She wasn’t <em> that </em> much younger than him that he wouldn’t have remembered.</p><p>Tom stared at the photos.</p><p>She was wearing the same strange muggle clothing that she had worn in his dream.</p><p>Tom began to put it together. The dreams about the Tempaestus. <em> Her lies. </em></p><p>There was no other explanation. This witch had come from another time.</p><p>And clearly, since he didn’t recognize her, it was far enough in the future that he didn't know her…</p><p>… but she knew <em> him </em>.</p><p>There was no other explanation for the fear that she’d had in her eyes the moment they met. For her refusal to trust him. For her desire to fight him, even so far as to want to kill him.</p><p>But why did she fear him? If she was from the future… Why was she here?</p><p>So many things still didn’t make sense.</p><p>Tom’s brow furrowed. He looked back to the bathroom door.</p><p>She had been in the bathroom for quite a long time. </p><p>Tom crossed the room and stepped through the doorway.</p><p>Tom’s lips parted as he took in the sight.</p><p>Hermione sat in her large clawfoot tub. The shower was turned on and the water pelted her. She still had her nightgown on, and her hair was soaked. Water ran down her face but she didn’t seem to notice.</p><p>She was weeping. Sobbing uncontrollably. She had her knees hugged to her chest and her cheek lay on the top of her knees, her head turned to the side, toward Riddle, but she looked straight through him.</p><p>Tom stood frozen. He felt himself breathing heavily, but it was a distant impression, as he felt it only through the silver cord that still connected him to his physical body. It tugged at him, a tautness that was mildly uncomfortable, but Tom ignored it.</p><p>He felt an acute emotional pain, but it was not his pain. Guilt racked him, threatening to bury him alive.</p><p><em> Her </em>guilt.</p><p>Tom walked through the bathroom and knelt beside her. His eyes roamed her face. Her lips were almost a purple or bluish color and that concerned him. He wondered if the water she sat beneath was cold. He couldn’t feel it in this state. He checked her eyes and her pupils were blown wide. Tom realized with some alarm that she might have taken far too many potions. Her eyes shouldn’t look like that. She was pale; too pale, and the rims of her eyes had a strange redness around them. Perhaps it was from crying, but the sight as a whole worried Tom. </p><p>He was not used to feeling worried.</p><p>“Hermione,” he breathed, but she could not hear him. His anger gave way to fear.</p><p>He exhaled in frustration, feeling a vague tension building in his body through the cord. </p><p>Hermione’s tears ran down her cheeks, but her face was unresponsive. She appeared numb and lifeless. </p><p>Something about this wasn’t right. This was not his witch. </p><p>The pain and guilt he felt vicariously through her was absolutely crippling.</p><p>Tom shook his head. <em> What the fuck is this? </em> he thought.</p><p>Tom was suddenly angry again. He was angry that she was hiding so many things from him. He was angry about her potion abuse; it had clearly reached a dangerous level. </p><p>He was angry that she refused to let him in. She was living in some other reality in her mind, a reality that she sought to keep from him.</p><p>Yet here she was, falling to pieces and he was powerless to comprehend. </p><p>He gazed at her, and his heart began to race as he noticed her eyes were drifting shut.</p><p>“Oh hell no,” he breathed. Tom immediately decided to take control of the situation.</p><p>Tom closed his eyes and began to chant a series of magical commands and incantations. He summoned the dark magic to himself, feeling it wrap around him like tendrils of shadow and energy. Then, he willed himself to become corporeal. He commanded the darkness to permeate his soul until he became a solid being of shadow. </p><p>Once he’d shifted, he crossed over to Hermione and lifted her from the tub.</p><p>It took a significant amount of magical energy to maintain this form, but Tom had trained himself for it. His magical stamina was unmatched.</p><p>She groaned and shook her head, then her eyes fluttered open. When she saw Tom, she gasped. </p><p>“Am I dreaming?” she said weakly. “Who are you?”</p><p>Tom glanced at the mirror as he moved to carry her from the bathroom. He was shocked by his own reflection. </p><p>He appeared as a being of pure shadow, his edges undefined, shifting and glitching and amorphous. The only thing he could make out for certain were his glowing red eyes. </p><p>He was quite terrifying. No wonder she was afraid. </p><p>She tried to pull out of his grasp but he held onto her tightly. “You know who I am, little witch.” His voice was no longer his own; it sounded like the embodiment of pure darkness.</p><p>Her mouth fell open; she gazed at him but her eyes were glassy and faraway. She shook her head as if in a trance. “Tom?”</p><p>He carried her into the bedroom, casting a wandless <em> accio </em>which summoned her wand from the pocket of her robes. He laid her on the bed and then examined her wand. Vinewood, with little carvings etched into its side. He cast a diagnostic charm on her, but it showed him nothing beyond a slow pulse and a low heart rate. He laid his shadowy hand around her throat and felt for the vein in her neck. It was pumping sluggishly slow.</p><p>“Am I in a dream?” she whispered. </p><p>“Yes,” Tom muttered angrily. </p><p>“Is this who you are?” she murmured, reaching out a hand to touch him. “Is this who you are inside your soul?”</p><p>Tom’s eyes met hers. Her words confused him.</p><p>“Why won’t you tell me the truth, Hermione? Why do you lie to me?” he asked in his preternatural voice. The voice was strange and deep, with varying tones that almost sounded as if it were coming from multiple beings.</p><p>She swallowed, her eyes fluttering as if she might lose consciousness again. The corners of her lips turned up in the barest hint of a smile. “Because you’d kill me if I did.”</p><p>Tom stood looking down at her, dumbstruck.</p><p>Her eyes fluttered shut. He felt for the vein in her neck. It was pumping even slower.</p><p>“Fuck,” he cursed. </p><p>He started to lift her up. “Sit up,” he commanded.</p><p>“No,” she murmured weakly but he yanked her forward and propped her up against the massive amount of pillows. As he gripped her arm and lifted her back, he noticed something. Something he’d not seen prior.</p><p>Tom stopped breathing. There, on Hermione’s arm, was a ghastly scar. Etched into her skin, was the word “mudblood.” Tom swallowed. His eyes flicked to her face.</p><p>She’d had it covered beneath some sort of enchantment this <em> whole </em> time and he had not noticed it. </p><p>Rage threatened to choke Tom.</p><p>This was what the woman was carving into her arm.</p><p>He quickly examined the rest of her body before he noticed another scar peeking from above the neckline of her nightgown. He hooked his finger in the top of her gown and drew it downward. There was a long, thin pink scar. From the shape, it was obviously caused by a curse.</p><p>How many times had his lips trailed along the skin there? How had he not realized she’d had concealment charms on these scars? </p><p>Had he truly been this blinded by this infuriating witch?</p><p>He didn’t have time to think about it. Hermione’s eyes fluttered shut.</p><p>“No you don’t,” he bit out.</p><p>Tom grabbed an empty dress box from the floor and held it in front of her.</p><p>“Open your mouth,” he commanded.</p><p>She didn’t seem to be conscious of his instructions, so he gripped her cheeks, forcing her mouth open. As soon as her lips parted, he shoved his fingers between them and over her tongue. She gagged as they dove down the back of her throat. She jerked against him.</p><p>“Don’t act like you haven’t done this before, little witch,” he muttered in an attempt at a joke, but he felt no humor.</p><p>She coughed and gagged. He had to perform the gesture three times before she finally choked, then convulsed as the contents of her stomach came up into the box. </p><p>“At least your gag reflex is getting better.” Humor helped keep him from panicking, but it didn’t feel funny at all.</p><p>Tom’s shadowy fingers held back her hair. He sighed. “Good girl.”</p><p>Hermione sobbed. Tom forced her onto her side into a recovery position and tilted her head back, then he vanished the box.</p><p>When he was satisfied that she was breathing and stable, he walked out into her flat and began to search for her potions cabinet. He located it in the elves’ pantry and began rifling through the various elixirs, salves, and draughts until he found her stash of elixir. There were <em> dozens </em> of vials. He uncorked one and sniffed it. He recognized the scent. </p><p>“Elixir of Euphoria,” he breathed. Why was she taking these? Tom knew that it was highly addictive. He had a feeling his witch was hiding much more from him than he’d originally imagined. Tom immediately began searching through her potions ingredients. If he weren’t tremendously angry with her, he would have been impressed with her stores. </p><p>He didn’t find a bezoar, but found a bottle of poison antidote which contained a bezoar as an ingredient. It was primarily used for treating poison but had been known to be effective in reducing the symptoms of potion overdose as well. He grabbed the bottle and another empty vial and brought them into the bedroom.</p><p>He found her passed out. </p><p>“Wake up, little witch, before I strangle you with my own hands.” He rolled her onto her back and lifted her up. He poured a small amount of antidote over her tongue and forced her to swallow it. </p><p>“And to think, you could’ve been swallowing my cum tonight instead.”</p><p>Her eyes fluttered and she sobbed. More tears spilled over her cheeks. “Harry, I’m sorry,” she whispered. He knew that elixir of euphoria tended to cause hallucinations when consumed in large amounts. He wanted to know who Harry was to her.</p><p>Tom sighed. “Might as well take advantage of the situation, I suppose.” He held an empty vial to her cheek, collecting several tears. His magical stamina was becoming severely taxed. He’d never pushed himself to remain corporeal this long. He corked the vial and sat it on her bedside table.</p><p>He monitored her pulse. Her lips were still a bluish color. “Fuck you for this,” he said tersely, shaking his head. </p><p>He poured more antidote over her tongue.</p><p>After a few minutes, he noticed her pulse began to pick up noticeably. </p><p>He released his breath in halting degrees. He hadn’t realized he’d been holding it.</p><p>He stayed beside her until her breathing and pulse were back to normal. Once he was convinced she was stabilized and fast asleep, he released the dark magic that filled his being and disintegrated. </p><p>He couldn’t be here any longer. He needed to think. His rage was absolutely <em> paralyzing </em>.</p><p>He followed the tugging of the silver cord and traveled back to his flat.</p>

<p>Tom wanted nothing better than to strangle Hermione. </p><p>He departed his flat and strode down Knockturn Alley until he came to the brick wall which concealed the giant’s quarter. He tapped the bricks in a familiar pattern and disappeared into the darkness. </p><p>The last time he’d stood before this doorway, he’d been with a blindfolded Hermione. Her hair had smelled like lavender and vanilla and salt and it seemed like only yesterday that he’d tasted her for the first time in Godric’s Hollow.</p><p>In truth, it had been nearly six months.</p><p>In those six months, this witch had leaked into his bloodstream and infected his soul like the blackest, most noxious poison. Her lies had created an open wound which festered, suffused grotesquely with the gangrene of his affection. </p><p>Tom entered the pub and took his usual place, a booth in the darkest corner of the section reserved for humans. </p><p>“Tom,” greeted Maigog as he approached the booth. “Haven’t seen ye around lately.”</p><p>“I’ve been busy,” Tom muttered sourly. </p><p>“When are ye no’ busy?”</p><p>Tom inclined his head in acknowledgement. “Not often enough.”</p><p>Maigog chuckled, unphased by Tom’s foul humour. “What can I get ye this evening?”</p><p>“Absinthe, if you have it.”</p><p>“Ah, ye know we’ve al’ays got it on hand,” bellowed the giant. “I’ll be righ’ back.”</p><p>Tom nodded stoically.</p><p>He intended to get drunk. It had been a very long time since he’d blacked out drinking and he savored the prospect. </p><p>He owed it to himself for putting up with his witch’s blatant disregard for decency. He thought of her words.</p><p>
<em> “What happened to you in life to make you so cruel?” </em>
</p><p><em> I don’t know, little cunt, </em> Tom thought viciously. <em> What happened to you to make you so callous that you find it necessary to torture me endlessly? </em></p><p>He had felt that he was finally on the verge of a breakthrough with Hermione. He felt it in his soul that she had been so close to lowering her defenses. </p><p>Then, she’d showed up at Riddle House and it had all gone to shit. She’d seen him slit a muggle’s throat. Now, she thought him a monster.</p><p>But in truth, the man he’d killed had been the truly evil one.</p><p>Tom was only partly a monster. It was true that he had a loose relationship with morality that most human beings hadn’t accepted yet, and most wouldn’t, until they realized the necessity of it too late in life. His morals served him, as everything else did in his life. He would never take the moral high road if it meant weakening himself, and that put him at an advantage. He’d learned this way of living as a lonely orphan with no earthly possessions and no loyalties. It was a tactic of survival. He’d learned the hard way that power was the most valuable commodity one could possess. </p><p>Since he had met Hermione, he desired power more than ever. It was the only way he could foresee himself being able to keep her. She was an incredibly bright witch, but unfortunately, too committed to her noble and high-minded ideals. That made her a liability; it made her reckless. He would be forced to ensure her safety, and that, by extension, meant he would likely have to resort to certain atrocious and dishonorable methods in order to do so.</p><p>Tom was okay with that. He possessed a certain code which he lived by, although anything outside of that code wouldn’t be tolerated. Tom would never repay loyalty with disloyalty, although the moment someone betrayed him, they were better off dead.</p><p>He would do whatever it took to be the most powerful wizard in existence. Did that make him a monster? Possibly.</p><p>But Tom wasn’t completely heartless.</p><p>He did <em> feel </em>things.</p><p>He arguably felt them <em> too </em>strongly.</p><p>What he felt for Hermione… to call it passion would be a crime.</p><p>It was practically apogean… the very pinnacle of the divine. </p><p>However… to convince Hermione of that? <em> Impossible </em>. She was committed to misunderstanding him.</p><p>Which brought into light all of her lies.</p><p>She knew who Tom was. Somewhere in the future, they’d known each other. But how? What was the nature of their relationship?</p><p>Tom swallowed and gritted his teeth. It was painfully obvious that they were enemies in another time. It only made sense. The way she’d feared him when they’d first met, the manner in which she fought him, the way she refused to trust him, even after submitting to being his lover, seemingly against her own will… it all pointed to one theory.</p><p>But why? Why would <em> he </em>be her enemy, when she was everything he wanted? When she was very likely the other half of his soul?</p><p>Surely in the future, he would have seen her in much the same light as he did now?</p><p>He had to be quite a bit older than she was in the future. How far back in time had his witch traveled?</p><p>He thought of the boy Hermione had been kissing… and the other whom she’d danced with.</p><p>Tom was overcome with crippling jealousy toward every person who’d known her in this previous life of hers.</p><p>She was <em> his </em> , and she belonged <em> here </em>. The thought that anyone else could stake any claim over her, or knew a version of her that he did not, was torturous.</p><p>Then there was something else that bothered Tom. If given the opportunity, would she desire to leave him and return to her time? He’d hardly allowed himself to think of it, but every time it crossed his mind, he nearly exploded with rage. </p><p>Tom attempted to calm himself, to pour salve over his fuming hatred long enough to see clearly. His rational side told him that there was likely a good reason his witch was lying to him. Perhaps he’d done something horrific to her in the future. He couldn’t deny that it was entirely possible, although he couldn’t imagine it. The thought made him viscerally ill. </p><p>Tom tried to take a step back from the situation to look at it logically, but he couldn’t shake the anger.</p><p>He forced himself to think of the scars on her body. He thought of her pale skin and blue lips. That alone served to temper his rage.</p><p>Something terrible had happened to Hermione. But <em> what </em>?</p><p>Why wouldn’t she tell him?</p><p>He needed to be pragmatic. It had been three days since he’d found her nearly overdosed on potions in her apartment. Each day and night he’d astral projected his soul into her flat to check on her. </p><p>They hadn’t spoken. He hadn’t written to her.</p><p>He’d been allowing himself time to process. For three days, he had circled through various theories and emotions. Anger, hatred, hurt, paranoia, lust, longing, fear, violence.</p><p>He’d imagined confronting her at first. He’d thought about strangling her. He had imagined the look on her face when she realized he’d poisoned her. He would probably administer a bezoar at the last second, but he couldn’t know for sure until that moment came. He thought about railing her so roughly that she wept.</p><p>He didn’t want to hurt her, nor kill her, in actuality. </p><p>He was simply wounded, and in that injuriousness, he’d let his mind run rampant. </p><p>He thought vindictively about treating her as if he were truly the monster she so desperately wanted to believe that he was.</p><p><em> I can hurt you, little witch, </em> he thought. <em> I can betray you, if that’s what you desire. Would it make everything easier for you if I did? Would you be able to run from me then? </em> </p><p>If she ran, he would chase her. He would track her down like an animal.</p><p>Then he would drag her back with a leash around her neck.</p><p>
<em> If I’m in chains, then you will be, too. </em>
</p><p>To think, she had almost domesticated him. He’d been more calm internally these past months than he had ever been in his life.</p><p>Hermione was like a wounded animal with sharp teeth. He was realizing this now. She’d been hiding it from him, her woundedness, masking it behind her potions and her work. The witch he’d seen three nights ago was severely traumatized.</p><p>That only meant that Tom would have to be more careful. He decided against confronting her. He couldn’t let her know what he’d discovered.</p><p>If he did, she would run. She’d already threatened as much.</p><p>Perhaps, if she thought him less of a threat, she would let her guard down. Then, if he was smart, he could discover more of what she was hiding from him.</p><p><em> Mudblood </em>. </p><p>Some mad witch had carved it into Hermione’s arm.</p><p>Was Hermione not Dumbledore’s daughter, then? If she wasn’t, where had the phoenix come from?</p><p>She was not pureblooded.</p><p>She was not a half-blood like Tom.</p><p>She was a muggleborn.</p><p>Tom leaned his head back against the wall, releasing his breath slowly. </p><p>No wonder she’d fought him so adamantly. No wonder she hated him and his pureblooded Death Eaters.</p><p>It all made sense now.</p><p>Tom didn’t want her to run. He didn’t want to spend a single moment without her.</p><p>Though he’d let himself think about it, there was no way in hell that he could actually bring himself to kill Hermione Dumbledore.</p><p>Because he’d already let himself imagine a future with her.</p><p>He was obsessively and compulsively devoted to that vision now. He was already searching for the Ribbon of Life with which he could bind her soul to his. If he couldn’t find it, he would simply make her into his next horcrux.</p><p>Tom needed to be inside of her. Their nights weren’t nearly enough to sate him.</p><p>He longed for a more permanent union. He wanted to be able to feel her when she wasn’t near him. He wanted to know her every thought. </p><p>He was clawing himself from the inside out with desire to possess her. </p><p><em> I might be mad, </em> he thought. <em> But I’m mad for you, little witch. </em></p><p>“You’re not safe, Hermione,” he muttered as he tipped back a crystal glass filled with green liquid. “You’re not safe from me.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Hermione hadn’t seen Tom in three days and it was killing her.</p><p>She lay on her bed after swigging an entire vial of elixir.</p><p>“I’m so messed up,” she whispered. “I’m so heinously in trouble.”</p><p>She couldn’t get the dream out of her head.</p><p>She’d dreamed several nights ago that she was dying. She was terribly cold and alone, plagued by visions of Harry and Ron. She’d dreamed of the battle again, of Remus and Tonks’ bodies laid out on the floor of the Great Hall. Of Fred’s funeral.</p><p>She knew she deserved to die for what she’d done. </p><p>But in the midst of her ascension, a black mass with red eyes had come to her and scooped her into its arms. It was not an entity that she recognized, and its voice was murky and cavernous, like the dark reaches of the ocean, miles below the water’s surface. </p><p>When she asked the being its identity, it answered, “You know who I am, little witch.”</p><p>The figure was rife with dark magic, and it should’ve been terrifying, but Hermione found him oddly comforting.</p><p>Hermione was convinced she’d dreamed of Tom’s soul.</p><p>She thought of the dream now, and hoped she might dream of it again.</p><p>Hermione sighed and waved her wand, putting out the light in her bedroom lamp and plunging her into darkness.</p><p>How many months had it been since she’d begun seeing Riddle nightly? It couldn’t have been long, perhaps two months, or three, but now she could hardly sleep without the scent of him around her.</p><p>The night was quiet, and the darkness was thick and alive, a breathing organism around her. </p><p>Where was he now? What was he thinking about?</p><p>Probably reading in bed with his shirt off, a cigarette between his lips.</p><p>She smiled to herself.</p><p>The last words he’d spoken: <em> We’ll talk about this later. </em></p><p>But then he disappeared. </p><p>She had prepared herself to fight him tooth and nail when he inevitably came pounding again at the door to her flat, but she hadn’t prepared herself for his silence.</p><p>
<em> His absence. </em>
</p><p>The quiet was deafeningly loud without the sound of his even breathing beside her.</p><p>Was he angry with her? Their last words had been harsh.</p><p>Would he ever think of killing her?</p><p>The distance caused an intense sense of fear and paranoia to build.</p><p>But perhaps it was for the best.</p><p>Hermione saw the muggle man floating in the air, his helpless body draining of blood.</p><p>She let her eyes fall shut.</p><p><em> That’s who Tom is, </em> she reminded herself. <em> A murderer. </em></p><p>She choked back a sob.</p><p>It was painful to breathe.</p><p>Hermione laid for several more minutes in uncomfortable silence before an unsatisfying sleep descended, capturing her like an unwilling prisoner and stealing her into the caves of her subconscious.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Hermione woke with a gasp.</p><p>Her bedroom was dark, and the silence was thick. She felt a pervading presence in her room.</p><p>“Piksy?”</p><p>There was no answer.</p><p>Hermione swallowed. The darkness was heavy and pregnant with dread.</p><p>Her heart thudded as she rose into lucidity.</p><p>“Who’s there?”</p><p>There was no answer.</p><p>Her eyes roved to and fro, slowly adjusting to the blackness.</p><p>Then, she saw him. </p><p>A man standing in front of her bedroom fireplace.</p><p>He was hooded and cloaked, wearing a white mask.</p><p>Her pulse jumped in her throat. </p><p>“Tom?”</p><p>There was no answer.</p><p>The man just stood facing her, unmoving and silent.</p><p>Despite the fact that it was the same mask Tom had worn at Riddle House, she felt genuine fear. Her flat was warded and enchanted. If anyone could break through them, it had to be Riddle, right?</p><p>Still, her hands trembled.</p><p>“Tom, is that you? Why are you here?”</p><p>The figure began to walk toward her.</p><p>Hermione instinctually sat up and slid backward on the bed. The chances that it was one of his Death Eaters was slim, but not zero.</p><p>He came to stand beside the bed, gazing down at her, the mask like a pale specter floating in the darkness.</p><p>Hermione felt transfixed, unable to move or speak. She stared at the mask, into the openings of its eyes.</p><p>“Tom,” she whispered, barely an utterance.</p><p>The man reached out, but paused as she jerked away slightly. Then, he continued his reach toward her face to brush his fingertips along her cheekbone. Hermione caught the barest hint of cedarwood, bergamot, and smoke.</p><p>How had he gotten into her flat?</p><p>But that was an idiotic question, wasn’t it? He’d broken into Azkaban. Her flat would probably be no issue for him.</p><p>Hermione was very still as he touched her. In the back of her mind, she knew that she should turn him away. Send him packing.</p><p>But the nature of his invasion had her somewhat paralyzed. She was caught off guard and disarmed by his silence.</p><p>Hermione sat frozen, as if the masked figure held her in a trance.</p><p>He took her chin and tilted her head upward. She faced the mask, held captive by the black holes behind which she knew he was looking back at her.</p><p>She heard him eject a short breath.</p><p>Then, his hand left her chin and wandered down to her chest. His thumb stroked her nipple over the silky fabric of her nightgown, and with his other hand, he reached out to slide the straps from her shoulder. He pushed the nightgown down and let it slip off her shoulders, then he brushed her hair away from her chest and let it fall down her back.</p><p>He laid a hand on her bare chest, directly over her violently thudding heart.</p><p>She knew he could feel her fear in the racing of her heartbeat.</p><p>Her lips parted as she sucked in a sharp breath.</p><p>If Tom had come to her during the day, she would have had the will to say no.</p><p>But he stood before her now, silent and commanding, a wraith in the thick of the night, of the darkness which had always belonged to them. Hermione ached with loneliness and with a desperation to have him closer. </p><p>His hand slid down from where it lay against her breast and jerked her nightgown up. He reached into the front of her knickers and brushed his fingers against her center. He inhaled sharply, then slipped his finger inside her. Hermione gasped.</p><p>She heard him unbuckling his belt with one hand, the familiar clink of the metal sending a shiver skittering across her skin.</p><p>Then, everything seemed to move in a blur.</p><p>He was climbing over her, pressing her roughly into the mattress. His scent was all around her, drowning her in sensory overload. She noted the strong aroma of alcohol. Of the few  times she’d drank with him, he’d never been intoxicated, but she suspected he might be tonight. There was a severity in his actions that betrayed a lack of inhibition.</p><p>There was no foreplay. There were no kisses nor sweet words. There was only desperation.</p><p>She felt him pressing at her entrance and before she could blink, he filled her in one swift movement. Hermione cried out, not in pain, but in the agony of a need too raw for words. She buried her face in his shoulder as he pinned her arms to her side. </p><p>His breathing was heavy as he entered her, thrusting slow and hard. The mask was inches from her face, and their breaths mingled; his smelled strongly of smoke and alcohol.</p><p>She moaned his name, and he moved faster.</p><p>This was where they belonged; in the shadows. Hermione wondered if they would ever venture into the light?</p><p>His strokes were so deep that Hermione felt them in her stomach.</p><p>“Fuck, Tom,” she gasped. He reached up and gripped her cheeks, forcing her to look at him. She could just make out the whites of his eyes behind the mask.</p><p>At last, he spoke. “Tell me, Hermione,” he commanded. “Say it.”</p><p>She knew what he wanted to hear. </p><p>“I’m yours,” she whispered.</p><p>“All of it.”</p><p>“I belong to you, Tom. Forever. I promise.” Could she even promise such a thing? The words fell from her lips with ease, and they had a traitorous taste, like poison.</p><p>“Mine,” he gritted. “You’re mine, little liar.” He reached between them and began to circle her clit with the pads of his fingers.</p><p>“Oh, god,” she moaned, feeling her walls tightening. She arched back, her head falling to the side, but he gripped her cheeks more firmly, bringing her gaze back to his.</p><p>“Look at me, baby,” he breathed. </p><p>The use of that word sent her and she fell off the edge, reduced to a trembling mess beneath him. As she came, she felt three treacherous words on the tip of her tongue, but she bit them back. A deep blush crept into her face.</p><p>He continued to thrust, his mask pressed to her cheek and his breath hot against her ear.</p><p>“I want you, Hermione.” There was a candid ache in his voice.</p><p>She arched against him, feeling pressure building once again deep within her core. “You have me,” she murmured.</p><p>“No,” came his breathless reply. “You lie. But I <em> will </em>have you. No one understands you like I do. No one can touch you like I can. I’m made for you.” </p><p>He lowered his voice to a whisper that sent shivers down her spine. His movements became coarse and frenetic. “One day I will own you, and I will take care of you, and we will rule like gods.”</p><p>His words struck fear into her heart. She feared that he would somehow make it so. Tom Riddle might have once been a wounded young boy, but Lord Voldemort was relentless and unyielding in pursuit of what he wanted.</p><p>Hermione cried out as her body tensed, soaring into oblivion once more. </p><p>“Fuck,” he groaned, hardening within her as he pumped her full of his spend. </p><p>She reached up and ripped off his mask, seeking out his lips as euphoria washed over them.</p><p>He kissed her hungrily as he rode out his release. Her fingers threaded into his black hair and she moaned against his lips. She’d missed the taste of his mouth more than anything.</p><p>When they broke apart, each breathless and spent, he rolled away from her and stood.</p><p>She heard the clink of his belt and the sound of his zipper. </p><p>Then he stood staring down at her for several moments.</p><p>Something hung in the air that was too sacred to utter in the tongue of humans.</p><p>Then, he turned and left, closing the door behind him.</p>

<p> </p><p>Tom leaned against the stone wall of the chamber of secrets. It had been years since he’d been in this room, and it brought back a flood of both positive and negative memories.</p><p>The day was Thursday, and he had come to Hogwarts to visit Slughorn and to work on the soulmate potion. He’d brought Hermione’s tears with him and they had added the necessary ingredients, stirring three times clockwise. In another month, the potion would be finished brewing.</p><p>On his way out, he’d taken a detour. Tom wasn’t sure exactly why he’d wanted to come here. Perhaps to reminisce; or rather, perhaps he felt that the rush of nostalgia would somehow make things clearer. He was lacking in clarity of late, his mind muddled with feelings and contradictions.</p><p>He stared at the statue of Salazar Slytherin. The last time Tom had been here, he’d been somewhat torn. Though Myrtle’s death had been an accident, Tom had not really known how to feel about it. Her death was the first time someone had died as a result of his actions. A part of Tom had been giddy with delight at the thought of creating his first horcrux. Another part of him felt defiled and twisted by the looming shadow of the murder. </p><p>He still to this day wasn’t sure how he felt about Myrtle’s death. That was part of the reason he’d taken it upon himself to kill his father. He hated his father with a burning passion, and he’d wanted to know what it felt like to <em> mean it </em>. To commit the act of murder and watch the light leave someone’s eyes intentionally. Tom had needed to know if he was capable of doing it, and if he would feel remorse. He needed to test himself; to discover his own limits, or lack thereof.</p><p>Tom felt no remorse for the death of his father. He’d felt nothing but cold, hard satisfaction. One of Tom’s purest traits had always been a pervasive sense of justice. He was committed to the balancing of scales. Wrongs deserved punishment. Rights deserved reward. Which is one reason he still felt a measure of guilt over Myrtle’s death. He wanted his victim’s deaths to be well-deserved; he desired that murder should be <em> intentional </em>. At the time, Tom had convinced himself that he’d done the right thing in opening the chamber of secrets. He’d been young and impulsive; Tom had since learned to reign in his impulsive side.</p><p>He, a young orphan still learning his place in the world, had cleaved to the idea of blood purity. It was the one shining beacon in his dull and colorless life. It gave him a sense of superiority. His lineage both mortified and excited him. He despised his muggle roots, but adored the newfound sense of import he’d gained from the knowledge of his Gaunt blood: the blood belonging to Salazar Slytherin. He was the last heir of Slytherin, and when he’d heard the legend, Tom had made it his mission to open the chamber of secrets. </p><p>If Slytherin, who was idolized by the pureblood community, had made it his mission to eradicate muggleborns from Hogwarts, then shouldn’t that be Tom’s mission as well?</p><p>He’d truly believed for some time that muggles and muggleborns alike were beneath him. Tom had done everything in his power to compensate for the muggle part of his ancestry, but it seemed that no amount of magical competency or charm could erase that smudge from his bloodline. </p><p>Tom knew deep down that blood purity had nothing to do with wit or magical efficacy. He’d always known it, but when one is surrounded by nothing but purebloods who spout that kind of rhetoric incessantly, some things are bound to be drilled into one’s thought patterns.</p><p>Tom stared at the statue. Suddenly, his boyhood convictions and philosophies seemed childish and inane. Absurd, even.</p><p><em> Mudblood </em>.</p><p>Hermione could’ve been Myrtle.</p><p>
<em> Purge the school of mudbloods. </em>
</p><p>Tom tried to imagine what it would have been like if he had attended Hogwarts with Hermione. They wouldn’t have seen much of each other. She was a Gryffindor, and a few years younger than him. Would he have been as enamored of her as he is now? Surely he would have.</p><p>But if he had known she was muggleborn then, he would have despised her instantly. </p><p>Tom knew the truth; despite hating her, he would have wanted her. She would have captivated him somehow, and he wouldn’t have been able to stop himself from pursuing her. Perhaps he would’ve shown her the hidden room in the castle.</p><p>He’d never taken Walburga there, but he would’ve taken Hermione.</p><p>He never would have even fucked Walburga Black, or any of the preening pureblooded cunts he’d railed if Hermione had been in the picture.</p><p>Tom looked up as he heard a sliding sound, and the splashing of water. The sound of his basilisk’s words reached his ears.</p><p>He reached into his robes and produced a blindfold. Better safe than sorry.</p><p>He caught a tiny glimpse of his basilisk sliding through the mouth of the statue before he tied the blindfold around his head.</p><p>He hissed a greeting to the basilisk and reached out a hand. He felt the scales of the serpent sliding beneath his palm. The basilisk hissed happily back at him.</p><p>Tom felt for the serpent’s head. Then, he withdrew his wand and aimed it at the snake’s eyes. The red curse fell upon the creature and he heard it crying out and hissing. </p><p>“Can you see?” he asked the serpent.</p><p>“I can see nothing,” hissed the snake unhappily. “My eyes are swollen shut.”</p><p>Tom pulled off his blindfold. His conjunctivitis curse had worked well. The serpent’s eyes leaked with liquid and were puffed up and irritated.</p><p>Tom stared at the serpent. He’d always been so proud of this creature. </p><p>Now, he saw it as an enemy.</p><p>This alarmed Tom.</p><p>It had begun to happen so slowly that he hadn’t noticed it. </p><p>His allegiances were steadily changing.</p><p>Any enemy of Hermione’s was an enemy of his.</p><p><em> Mudblood </em>.</p><p>Rage tore at Tom. He felt rage toward himself and rage at the basilisk before him, and everything the monster stood for.</p><p>He felt rage toward Hermione for making him feel this way. </p><p>She had suddenly become his weakness. Any threat to her safety and well-being was a threat to Tom’s own sanity.</p><p>In a surge of impulsiveness, Tom conjured a blade out of thin air and drove it through the serpent’s skull.</p><p>It hissed and screeched but Tom was brutal as he drove the blade deeper. The serpent’s giant body convulsed and twitched. Tom had to dive out of the way as its tail whipped around like a sidewinder’s, twisting itself into contorted positions in the throes of death.</p><p>As he had with his father, Tom felt nothing but cold, hard satisfaction as he gazed at the body of the basilisk. Its coils slowly unwound, intermittently spasming. </p><p>Tom dropped the blade, which was coated with black blood, letting it fall into the water with a satisfying splash. Then, he turned coldly and exited the chamber without so much as a backward glance, sealing it forever.</p><p>He double checked that the bathroom was empty before he emerged. He washed the splattered blood from his hands. Luckily, he was clothed in all black, so the serpent’s blood wasn’t visible on his clothing. Just to be sure, he cast scourgify on his robes and then left the bathroom. As he made his way down the familiar hallway, he heard footsteps approaching. As he rounded the corner, he nearly ran into Albus Dumbledore.</p><p>Both men paused their strides.</p><p>Dumbledore tilted his head, peering at Tom through his spectacles. “Hello, Tom. I must say, it is a surprise to see you here.”</p><p>“Good evening, Headmaster.”</p><p>“May I ask what it is you’re doing at Hogwarts?”</p><p>Tom gestured with one hand. “I was meeting with Professor Slughorn. He’s been helping me brew a particularly difficult and arcane potion.”</p><p>“And what potion might that be?”</p><p>Tom swallowed, his eyes sharp. “Tears of Adonis.” He knew that if he lied, Dumbledore would just find out from Slughorn, and Tom didn’t dare return to Slughorn’s office to obliviate him.</p><p>Dumbledore gazed at Tom. From the look he gave Riddle, there was no doubt that he knew the purpose of the potion.</p><p>He said nothing for several moments. Tom considered walking away, but before he could make his excuses, Dumbledore replied, “Slughorn’s office is on the other side of the castle, Tom.”</p><p>Tom inclined his head. “So it is.” When Dumbledore didn’t make any move to leave, Tom explained, “I thought I’d take the scenic route and reminisce a bit. Hogwarts is still home to me, after all.”</p><p>“Of course,” said Dumbledore with a nod. “That’s understandable. I’m sure you know the way out, then, Tom. I don’t need to reacquaint you?”</p><p>Tom smiled tightly. “No, sir. I shouldn’t think so.”</p><p>Neither wizard said anything further.</p><p>Tom smirked. “Good day to you, Headmaster.”</p><p>He moved as if to leave.</p><p>As he passed by, suddenly the older wizard’s hand shot out and gripped Tom’s shoulder, halting him in his tracks.</p><p>Tom’s jaw tensed and he turned his head slowly to meet the gaze of his old transfiguration professor.</p><p>Dumbledore spoke in a hushed tone, but his words were clear and succinct. “I will only say this once, Tom. If you harm a hair on my daughter’s head, there won’t be an auror in all of magical Britain that will be able to locate all the pieces of your body.”</p><p>Tom stared back at Dumbledore blankly, without emotion.</p><p>At that, Dumbledore gave him a sharp look and released him. Then, he walked away, down the dark corridor and out of sight.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Tom stood at the window of his flat, gazing down at the street as a woman garbed in a hooded cloak made her way down Knockturn Alley. She looked both ways and then entered the corridor leading to his apartments.</p><p>He lifted the cigarette to his lips and inhaled, rolling it between his thumb and pointer finger. He’d just gotten off work and wanted nothing more than to rip off his tie, unbutton his shirt, and relax with a book on blood curses. Instead, he left his tie and work robes on; he had no intention of being so intimate with his visitor. </p><p>Only his witch would see him in his most relaxed state.</p><p>After a moment, the door to his flat sounded with a soft rapping of a woman’s knuckles. It was a sophisticated knock, one belonging to a prim and well-bred female.</p><p>Tom opened the door.</p><p>She lowered her hood. “Hello, Mr. Riddle.”</p><p>“Good evening, Mrs. Tuft.”</p><p>He moved aside to allow her to enter his flat.</p><p>She walked in slowly. Her eyes roamed the small space in a sweeping look as she doffed her gloves, one finger at a time.</p><p>“So this is your place?”</p><p>He smirked, then inclined his head. “It is. Though I sincerely doubt it compares with the Tuft Estate.”</p><p>She smiled as she gazed around her. “I think that’s what I like about it.”</p><p>He blinked. “Can I pour you a drink?”</p><p>Her eyebrows lifted with interest. “Oh, yes, please. What do you have?”</p><p>“Why don’t you take what I give you?”</p><p>She gave a muted smile and cocked a brow. “Fair enough.”</p><p>He poured a short glass of brandy for her, and none for himself. He crossed the room and handed it to her.</p><p>She took it from his hand, her fingers brushing his for a second. She flicked her eyes up to his. “Thank you.”</p><p>He inclined his head and placed his cigarette between his lips, inhaling deeply.</p><p>“Thank you for having me over. I know I sort of invited myself.”</p><p>He shrugged nonchalantly. “It’s no inconvenience, I assure you.”</p><p>She wandered to the window. “I suppose I was curious where you lived.”</p><p>He blew out a puff of smoke. “Well, now you know.”</p><p>She nodded, then turned her attention to the street below, observing the skulking figures and sketchy characters that frequented the shrunken head shop across the street.</p><p>“I suppose congratulations are in order,” Riddle remarked.</p><p>She turned to him and smiled; it was an easy smile. The kind that made people comfortable. “Thank you, Tom. I look forward to introducing you to a few people at the inaugural ball this weekend.”</p><p>Tom took a drag. “I’ve decided that I rather despise politicking.”</p><p>“It’s a means to an end.”</p><p>“Oh yes,” he breathed, ejecting smoke. “But it is a very infuriating means.”</p><p>She untied her cloak and draped it over the arm of his sofa, revealing a form fitting sheath dress underneath with a daringly cut neckline. “You say you are not a politician, Riddle, but you will have to become one in order to win the favor of the people.”</p><p>Tom gazed at her blankly. “Do you consider Albus Dumbledore to be a politician?”</p><p>“No. Not at all. He is decidedly the opposite of a politician.”</p><p>He nodded as he sucked on his cigarette, his chest rising and falling as he inhaled. “And yet, he’s been offered the position of Minister for Magic <em> and </em>Supreme Mugwump.”</p><p>She smiled wryly. “Touche, Mr. Riddle. But he is <em> very </em>powerful.”</p><p>Tom smirked. “I am very powerful, Mrs. Tuft.”</p><p>“That remains to be seen,” she murmured. “Please. call me Wilhelmina.”</p><p>He blinked. “I prefer Mrs. Tuft.”</p><p>She chuckled. “Suit yourself.”</p><p>He leaned against the wall. “I still haven’t decided whether I want to be your puppet mugwump.”</p><p>She walked over to stand beside Riddle as she took a sip of brandy. “It is a very powerful position.”</p><p>Tom nodded. “It is tempting. But I think I’d rather create my own pathway to power. One that allows me to pull the strings, rather than be preoccupied with minor breaches of the statute and the royal fuck-ups of international leaders.”</p><p>She took a step closer. “Do you really believe the statute can collapse without a bloody war?”</p><p>He shook his head. “No. I believe there will be war. But there will be war with or without the fall of statute.”</p><p>She gazed at him in surprise. “Why is that?”</p><p>“Because I will start one.”</p><p>Her lips parted and she cocked a brow. “You’re quite bold, telling me that.”</p><p>He smirked, but his eyes were cold. “Do you think I’m afraid of you, Mrs. Tuft?”</p><p>Her chest rose and fell with her breathing as she gazed at him. Wilhelmina Tuft had never been so infatuated with a wizard in her entire existence. “No, I don’t. That’s the issue with men. They are the great underestimators of powerful women.”</p><p>He smiled, flashing his predatory teeth. “Do you think I underestimate you? Or is it, perhaps, that you underestimate me?”</p><p>She swallowed. “I think you want people to underestimate you.”</p><p>Their eyes locked, and he muttered, “Perhaps so. You could be falling into my trap.”</p><p>She leaned forward against her better judgment, laying a hand on his chest. “I am certain I’m falling… whether it’s a trap or not, I can’t be sure.”</p><p>He gazed down at her. Her eyes roamed his face, tracing his lips, wandering over his black eyes, dark lashes, and chiseled jawline. She bit her lip.</p><p>“Will you not kiss me, Riddle?”</p><p>His jaw tensed. He made no move to touch her. “Do you want me to fuck you, Mrs. Tuft?”</p><p>She laughed breathlessly. “Well… I <em> suppose </em>that could be on the table.”</p><p>His eyes narrowed. “It’s funny. You try to get me to play a politician, but yet you refuse to stop acting like one around me. Truthfully, if you want to get somewhere with a man like me, Mrs. Tuft, you’d stop playing innocent.”</p><p>She lifted her chin. “Alright. Suppose I do want to have sex with you?”</p><p>Tom smiled. “That’s better.” He leaned in, gripping her arm. She held her breath as he whispered in her ear, “However, it’s not going to happen. I already have a witch, Wilhelmina.”</p><p>She laughed breathlessly. “I can handle rejection, Tom. You don’t have to make up stories to spare my feelings.”</p><p>This time, Tom chuckled under his breath. “You know what I find funny? That you think I’d make something up to soothe your wounded pride.” </p><p>“So it’s true?”</p><p>He nodded once. “It is.”</p><p>Her smile tightened a degree and she removed her hand from his chest. “I had not heard of this. Everyone I’ve spoken to has been quite convinced of your bachelorhood.”</p><p>“I keep my love life private.” He lifted the cigarette to his lips, taking a drag and exhaling smoke from the side of his mouth.</p><p>Tuft rubbed her lips together. “Is she young and beautiful?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Younger than you?”</p><p>“A bit.”</p><p>She took her glass from the table and sipped the brandy. “Do you like them young and impressionable then?”</p><p>His eyes narrowed slightly. “I could ask you the same thing, couldn’t I?” Riddle took another drag. “Young? Yes. Impressionable? No. She’s quite brilliant. I consider her to be a force in her own right.”</p><p>She gave an enchanting laugh. “I can’t imagine a witch who could impress you, Riddle.”</p><p>“I don’t suppose you could.”</p><p>She gazed at him, flicking her eyes over his person. “Well. I confess I’m disappointed. I rather hoped we might deepen our alliance… in a carnal way.”</p><p>He ran his tongue over his top teeth. “You’re quite forward, aren't you?”</p><p>She laughed. “You did tell me to stop playing the part of the politician, did you not? Besides, us older women have to be bold about what we want, don’t we?”</p><p>“He took another drag from his dwindling cigarette. “You’re very beautiful for an older woman.” </p><p>“But not as beautiful as your witch, I suppose?”</p><p>The corners of his lips turned up in a smile. “No. I probably would have fucked you a year ago. But I’m afraid she’s ruined me for other witches.”</p><p>“Hmm.” She walked over to his table, setting her drained glass down on the rickety wood. She looked quite out of place in his flat with her fine robes and delicate bone structure. “Well, I wish you the best with her. Will you marry her?”</p><p>“I don’t think either of us are the marrying type.” He put his cigarette out on an ashtray.</p><p>“I can’t see you with children, Riddle. That’s for sure.”</p><p>He shook his head. “I believe I would be a terrible father. As my father was, ironically. I suppose I did inherit some traits of his, after all.” </p><p>She turned back to him, her eyes sharp as they caught his. “Powerful people should really not have children. Their children usually end up either dead or severely disillusioned.”</p><p>“I have to agree. So which will your son be?”</p><p>She glared at him. “That remains to be seen. He talks of following in my footsteps.” She paused. “Is that why you keep your witch hidden? Do you fear for her, with all your gory plans of war?”</p><p>“No,” he lied shortly. Then, he followed with the truth. “I'm afraid she would rather not be seen with me.”</p><p>She laughed incredulously. “Now I <em> do </em>find that ironic. I can’t imagine a woman who wouldn’t want to be on your arm, Mr. Riddle. I’ve heard nothing in my circles recently but women droning on about your charm and devastating good looks. Is it because you’re a shopboy, perhaps?”</p><p>“I’m afraid not,” he chuckled. “It’s because I’m a dark lord.” He winked at her.</p><p>Wilhelmina laughed tacitly. “I’m quite jealous, truth be told. Will you see her after this?”</p><p>“I see her nearly every night, Mrs. Tuft.”</p><p>“Hmm,” she smiled ruefully. “How quaint. A loyal wizard, going home to his witch.” Her words were laced with sarcasm.</p><p>He nodded. “Exactly… and you, Wilhelmina, should probably go home to your husband. You’ll find no safe haven with me.”</p><p> </p>

</p><p> </p><p>It was Friday evening, and Hermione had picked up her dress for the inaugural banquet from Twillfit and Tattings. She had planned a girl’s night with Cedrella Weasley, her co-worker, Eulessia Baron, and her two elf friends, Lucky and Piksy. </p><p>First, they had dinner at a popular wizarding restaurant in Kettel Court, after which Hermione took them on a tour of the new wizarding Bank which was finally nearing the end of construction. Then, Hermione had suggested they go to the muggle cinema. It was an entirely new experience for Eulessia, Cedrella, Lucky, and Piksy, due to the fact that the magical community had no equivalent for movies or moving pictures. Lucky and Piksy attended as well, under polyjuice potion, and Eulessia and Cedrella were flabbergasted by the entire outing. They saw the Oscar winning film “Key Largo,” starring Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, the latter of whom happened to be one of Hermione’s favorite actresses of the period. </p><p>After the film, they’d all agreed to go back to Hermione’s flat and bake sweets and prepare their attire for the banquet the following evening. Since it was a ministry event, Cedrella would be attending with Septimus, and Eulessia would attend as a press representative. Hermione, of course, would be attending on the arm of Gaspard. They had decided to spend the night at Hermione’s flat, so that they could all get ready together the next day with the aid of Piksy and Lucky. Cedrella was in a particularly pleasant mood, as her sister Callidora had agreed to watch baby Bilius for the weekend, a gesture which genuinely brought tears to her eyes, as the rest of her Black relatives had disowned her for her marriage to Septimus. To see her sister truly trying meant the world to Cedrella.</p><p>Later that night, the friend group finally made their way up the elevator of Hermione's building, and the polyjuice had begun to fade from Lucky and Piksy. They were laughing together about one of Hermione and Eulessia’s irritating co-workers as Hermione waved her wand to open the door to her flat. </p><p>The ladies giggled as they walked through the foyer. “Merlin’s beard, I’ve <em> never </em> laughed so hard as when Kogrod hid Eustace’s quill for the entire day. He kept asking every <em> single </em> person in <em> every </em> department and I could <em> not </em>keep a straight face.”</p><p>As the ladies entered the sitting room, the group stopped short as they found Tom Riddle standing there waiting in the center of the room. He’d been sitting on the sofa, but stood abruptly when the women entered. To his credit, he looked quite shocked to see Hermione with company.</p><p>“Oh, my,” whispered Eulessia in a scandalized tone. “Will you be joining the girl’s sleepover?” She snuck a glance at Hermione and grinned. “I wasn’t aware you’d hired a male entertainer, Hermione, but I'm certainly not complaining.”</p><p>Hermione’s eyes widened with something resembling immense mortification and she gave Eulessia her best “shut the hell up” look and strode across the room with intent.</p><p>Riddle stood observing the scene with amusement, his jaw jutted to the side with a barely concealed smirk.</p><p>Hermione walked up to Riddle and spoke in a muted tone. “Can we talk outside?”</p><p>He nodded, flicking his eyes at her companions and bestowing them with a nod before he walked through the foyer out into the hallway.</p><p>Hermione followed him through the door and closed it behind her. She could hear giggles coming from inside once it was closed.</p><p>She turned back to Riddle. “What are you doing here? How did you get in?”</p><p>“Same way I got in last time.”</p><p>She looked at him with eyebrows raised. “Which was how?”</p><p>He smirked, then reached out to brush his fingertips along her cheek. “Tell me one of your secrets, love, and I’ll tell you mine.”</p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes. That was getting quite old now. “What do you want?”</p><p>“Why so tacit today, little witch?”</p><p>Her mouth fell open. “You <em> cannot </em>be serious.”</p><p>He cocked a brow.</p><p>She shook her head, already exasperated. “You think I really want to talk to you after you ignored me for three days, then broke into my flat the other night, slept with me, and then left like it was nothing?”</p><p>He pressed his tongue against his cheek. “It’s not like you were begging me to stay.”</p><p>“Should I have to?”</p><p>The corners of his lips turned upward. “Did you want me to? I assumed after our discussion the other morning that I wasn’t welcome for the time being.”</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. “Didn’t seem to stop you from breaking and entering in the middle of the night. In a bloody mask and cloak no less, like a damn creep.”</p><p>His lips spread into a grin, then he laughed under his breath. “I think you rather enjoyed it.”</p><p>Hermione swallowed. “Since you’re here… I have to ask you something.”</p><p>His eyes met hers. “Ask away, darling.”</p><p>“Why didn’t you cast the charm?”</p><p>His brows furrowed. “What?”</p><p>She looked at her hands. “The other night, when you left. You usually…” She cleared her throat. “You always cast a…”</p><p>His eyebrows lifted questioningly.</p><p>“... contraception charm,” she finished.</p><p>His eyes narrowed. “Did I not?”</p><p>Hermione shook her head.</p><p>Riddle froze, his dark eyes searching her face.</p><p>Hermione released a short breath through her nose. “Don’t worry, I cast it myself.”</p><p>Tom cleared his throat. “Hermione, I was very drunk that night.”</p><p>“I thought maybe you were, but… it’s difficult to tell with you.” She stared at him for a moment. “So you didn’t do it on purpose?”</p><p>His brows furrowed sharply and he cocked his head. “Of course not. Is that what you thought?”</p><p>She took a deep breath, averting her eyes. “I’d hoped you didn’t.”</p><p>Tom bit the inside of his cheek as he observed her closely. “Hermione. I might resort to a lot of nefarious means to get what I want but considering the circumstances of my <em> own </em>birth, children are not something that I’m willing to use as a manipulation tactic… nor would I put you in that position. I simply forgot. I don’t typically drink that heavily but…” He cleared his throat, his eyes flicking over to her. “I’ve had a lot on my mind.”</p><p>“I see,” she murmured quietly. “Well. It’s alright. I didn’t actually know the spell. I had to look it up. But it was in my spellbook.”</p><p>He stared at her. “Oh.”</p><p>“I mean…” she swallowed. “It’s just… I’ve never had to cast it. It’s not like I’ve had… well, I mean, <em> you </em> always cast it.”</p><p>Tom blinked twice. “Right. I’m sorry. I’ll have to be more vigilant in the future. I was out of my head that night.”</p><p>“It’s fine,” she muttered coolly. “I know the spell now, anyway. I should’ve already learned it, to be honest. I don’t know why I relied on you to do it for so long. Truthfully, you could’ve been pretending to cast it, for all I know.”</p><p>His eyes narrowed and he cocked his head. “Now why would I do that?”</p><p>“I’m not saying you would. I’m saying… you <em> could’ve </em>.”</p><p>His jaw tensed as he glared at her. “You <em> can </em>rely on me, Hermione. I wouldn’t do something to deceive or trap you. There’s no fun in that.”</p><p>She shrugged. “That’s fine, but how would <em> I </em> know that?”</p><p>He scowled at her. “It’s pretty obvious that you don’t know me very well at all.”</p><p>She scoffed. “I know you better than you think I do.”</p><p>His eyes narrowed and he took a step forward. “What do you mean by that?”</p><p>Her eyes flicked up to his. “Nothing.”</p><p>He grit his teeth, causing his jaw muscles to flex. He took a very deep, slow breath. “Well. I apologize for interrupting your night. There was something I wanted to discuss, but now is clearly not the time. I’ll be going. Goodnight, Hermione.” He turned to leave.</p><p>“Wait, Tom,” she breathed, grabbing his arm.</p><p>He paused, whipping his head around to stare at her hand where it rested on his arm. </p><p>She withdrew her hand as if scalded. “I <em> do </em>want to talk. But I can’t tonight. Or tomorrow, for that matter. I have to attend the inaugural banquet.”</p><p>He was quiet for a beat, his expression blank. “Who are you going with?”</p><p>Her eyes roamed his face, but she couldn’t decipher his thoughts. “He’s… the head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. An auror. Gaspard Dufresne.”</p><p>He nodded, his gaze distracted and faraway. </p><p>“Will you be there, Tom?”</p><p>He locked eyes with her. “Yes.”</p><p>She nodded as she gazed back at him. “Who will you go with?”</p><p>He smiled wryly. “I’m sure I can round up a pretty witch. Perhaps two. Why not be shocking?”</p><p>The bitter edge to his voice surprised her. His moods often gave her whiplash. She spoke hesitantly, “We’ve been at many events separately, Tom.”</p><p>He nodded. “Yes. We have.”</p><p>“It’s never… bothered you.”</p><p>His jaw tensed. “No. It hasn’t.”</p><p>They stood in silence. </p><p>Tom slid his hands into his pockets. “Why don’t you just write to me when you have a spare moment? I have to go.”</p><p>She nodded, and watched as he started down the hallway to the elevator. </p><p>“Tom!” she called.</p><p>He turned on his heel and cocked his head in perturbation as he stared at her.</p><p>“Sunday evening, I’ll be free. Can you come by then?”</p><p>Hermione felt a great divide, like a chasm of silence deepening between them.</p><p>“Sure, Hermione. Sunday evening.”</p><p>He turned without another word and walked away. She watched him disappear into the elevator, and her heart ached, for the first time since she’d met him, to tell him the truth. </p><p>Unfortunately, that was something she felt that she could never do.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p>Hermione entered her flat to be greeted with several questioning looks. Cedrella and Eulessia stared at her, eyebrows raised, arms crossed, feet tapping. Hermione’s heart raced.</p><p>“So,” Cedrella hedged as she poured cups of tea for everyone. “Who was <em> that </em>? Piksy won’t tell us a blasted thing.”</p><p>“Is that who I think it is, Hermione?” asked Eulessia. “Is that Tom Riddle?”</p><p>Hermione’s mouth fell open slightly. “How do you know him?”</p><p>“I went to school with him, of course. I was a few years older. I think he was in fourth year when I graduated? Yes, that seems right.”</p><p>“Oh,” Hermione breathed. “Of course. I forgot you were a Hufflepuff.”</p><p>“<em> Am </em> a Hufflepuff. You never really stop being of a certain house. You’re branded for life,” she laughed. “But really, what’s he doing in your flat when you’re gone, like he owns the place?”</p><p>“Um…” Hermione winced. “Well, I may or may not have been seeing him recently. But you <em> cannot </em>tell a soul. Either of you.”</p><p>“I’ll say, Hermione! Isn’t he the one you profess to dislike so strongly?” asked Cedrella.</p><p>“Well-”</p><p>“Is he the one who sent you the roses at work?” Eulessia questioned.</p><p>“Er- well, yes.”</p><p>The two women squealed, causing Lucky to jump several feet in the air.</p><p>“Tell us <em> everything </em>,” Eulessia demanded. “I’m afraid I’ll be destined to be single and lonely forever and Cedrella’s a toddler mom. We have to live vicariously through you. Don’t spare the juicy details please.”</p><p>Hermione’s eyes widened to the size of saucers. “<em> Pardon </em> me, but I promise it’s not anything solid with him. It’s quite ambiguous, really.”</p><p>“Are you going to the banquet with him tomorrow? Is that where you’re going to inform the world that you’ve gone from enemies to lovers?”</p><p>“Certainly not!” Hermione gasped. “<em> No one </em> can know! I don’t even know if I’ll keep seeing him. I don’t know anything. In fact, I’m quite <em> confused </em> about him <em> , </em>as it stands.”</p><p>“Sounds perfect to Piksy,” mused the elf dreamily, her cheek resting in her palm. “The confusing ones are always the best.”</p><p>Everyone stared at Piksy. Then, they all looked at one another, and burst out laughing.</p><p>“You are a mess, Piksy,” Hermione muttered as she gasped for breath.</p><p>“He’s very handsome, though,” Cedrella said to Hermione quietly.</p><p>“Yes,” Hermione sighed, cutting her eyes. “Unfortunately, he is.”</p><p>“<em>Unfortunately</em>? Rubbish. So who will you go to the banquet with, then?” asked Eulessia.</p><p>Hermione looked up. “<em> Oh </em>. Um, well, he’s an auror. Actually, he’s the head of the DMLE. Gaspard Dufresne.”</p><p>Cedrella’s mouth fell open and Eulessia gasped, her hands flew up to cover her mouth.</p><p>Cedrella looked at Hermione incredulously. “Are you <em> serious </em>?”</p><p>Hermione’s brows furrowed. “Of course I am. What do you mean?”</p><p>“Did he <em> ask </em>you to go?” Eulessia asked, her question muffled by her hands.</p><p>Hermione looked back and forth between them. “Yes, he did. Do either of you mind telling me what the problem is?”</p><p>“I mean, it’s no problem,” Cedrella mused. “But I don’t believe he’s been seen with a witch since his wife passed.”</p><p>Hermione’s eyes widened. “His <em> wife </em>? I had no idea he’d been married. What happened?” </p><p>“You don’t know?”</p><p>Hermione shook her head.</p><p>Cedrella passed out tea cups for everyone as Eulessia placed a warming charm on the scones.</p><p>“Gaspard’s family moved to Britain from France when he was younger,” Cedrella began. “He attended Hogwarts. He was in Ravenclaw House, and he met and married his wife straight out of school. I <em>think </em>she was a Hufflepuff. I don’t quite recall… He graduated in ‘29, I think. My older sister knew him. Anyway, they both went into the auror training program straight away so that they could help with the war effort. The war had started three years prior, so they were desperate for more aurors at the Ministry. They were thrown into it quite green, I've heard. Probably didn’t have all the proper training, if I had to guess. The auror department was a mess at that time.”</p><p>“I see,” Hermione murmured.</p><p>“I don’t know the details of how it happened, but about ten years ago, I’d say, while the war was still raging on, his wife got into a confrontation… or rather, an <em> ambush </em>with some of Grindelwald’s acolytes, and she was killed. Gaspard didn’t really take any time to grieve. He just threw himself into work and hasn’t let up since. He’s a legend, Hermione. He’s put more dark wizards in Azkaban than any other auror to date. He became the youngest department head in history. He cleaned up the auror department and instated a rigorous training program. He’s ruthless.”</p><p>“Wow,” Hermione replied, her expression twisting into one of pity. “I had no idea. How terrible, what happened to his wife. That must’ve been awful for him.”</p><p>“Exactly. That’s why I’m surprised to know he asked you to the banquet. He’s <em> never </em>been seen with a witch… not since she died. He only attends what he has to, and he always goes alone.”</p><p>Hermione’s lips parted. “I wasn’t aware of that.” </p><p>“He's quite a bit older than you, I imagine. Not that it matters." Cedrella and Eulessia looked at one another.  "We just thought we might warn you ahead of time, that it will likely cause a stir. I’m sure it will make the papers.”</p><p>Hermione swallowed. “I see. That’s good to know.”</p><p>Cedrella’s brows drew forward. “Has he expressed any interest in you? Have you seen him often?”</p><p>Hermione shook her head in bewilderment. “No, not at all. He’s always acted rather perturbed toward me, truthfully. I rather thought he disliked me. I’m just as shocked as you that he asked me.”</p><p>Eulessia sighed heavily. “Well, damn it all, if Hermione hasn’t seen more action in one week than I’ve seen in ten years.”</p><p>Piksy and Lucky burst out giggling, triggering the laughter of the rest of the room.</p><p>“Well,” Hermione chuckled. “At least I’ll have you all to tell me whether my gown is hideous or not tomorrow.”</p><p>Cedrella rolled her eyes. “You always look perfect, dear.”</p><p>“Are you going with someone, Eulessia?”</p><p>Eulessia’s eyes sparkled and she smiled demurely. “Aeris Flint.”</p><p>Hermione’s eyebrows rose and she smiled. “What a catch. He’s very nice.”</p><p>Eulessia beamed. “We’ve been out a few times. Of course, he’s a year or two younger than me, but he doesn’t seem to mind.”</p><p>Cedrella eyed Hermione searchingly. “What does your Riddle think of you going with Gaspard?”</p><p>“He’s not <em> my </em>Riddle,” Hermione corrected. “And he never seems to mind. I always go with… different people.”</p><p>Cedrella's expression waxed thoughtful. “Just how long <em> have </em>you been seeing him?”</p><p>Hermione hesitated. “Um… Since… the ICW convention?”</p><p>Cedrella and Eulessia both gasped. “Are you serious, Hermione?” </p><p>She swallowed, then nodded.</p><p>“Wait, <em> wait just a minute </em> ,” Cedrella interjected. “Septimus told me you were with a wizard one night outside your hotel in Plovdiv. Was it <em> him </em>?”</p><p>Hermione threw her head down into her hands, finally succumbing to embarrassment. She sighed, and mumbled through her hands. “Yes. It was him.”</p><p>Again, they squealed. </p><p>Eulessia grinned. “You’re <em>so</em> fucked.”</p><p>Hermione groaned into her hands. “I know.”</p><p>Her friends laughed and patted her on the back in consolation. </p><p>“I’m quite curious, though,” Cedrella murmured. “What will happen with Gaspard? Do you think he likes you?”</p><p>Hermione’s lips parted, and she took a deep breath. “<em> Merlin </em>, I have no earthly idea. I certainly didn’t think so, but… I’m not the world’s best at picking up on those kinds of cues.”</p><p>“Well,” Cedrella murmured softly. “You may want to inform him of whatever you have on the books with Riddle. Because that man is not one who needs his heart broken again. He likely needs it patched back up.”</p><p>Hermione’s eyes met Cedrella’s. She was very grateful to have a friend with her disposition. Though she was a Black, she was quite unlike any of the Blacks that Hermione had ever met. She was warm and kind, but also sharp and perceptive. When she voiced her opinion, it was always with quiet conviction. She rarely ever came across as judgmental, but her advice was always astute and piercingly wise.</p><p>“I heartily agree,” Hermione uttered soberly. “I’m glad I know a bit more about him before I flayed him open with another scathing diatribe.”</p><p>Eulessia gaped. “<em> Did you do that </em>?’</p><p>Hermione winced. “I might’ve been a little harsh with him while trying to get information for my article.”</p><p>Cedrella chuckled. “Well, whatever you did, it clearly got his attention.” Eulessia and Cedrella locked eyes, both women struggling to hold back their smiles.</p><p>The remainder of the night passed in much the same manner, with talk of boys, of their families and careers, and it gave Hermione the much needed reprieve that she needed from her heaviness and guilt. </p><p>As she took her nightly Elixir, she even felt hopeful that perhaps she could break her potion habit.</p><p>She had to transfigure her already large bed into a slightly bigger one, so that all three women could pile into it (even though her flat had guest rooms) with Lucky and Piksy sleeping cuddled up on the soft fur rug in front of the crackling fireplace.</p><p>She dreamed that night of Tom, and they were both in a black and white film like the one they’d seen at the cinema that evening. Tom was dressed in a similar fashion as Humphrey Bogart, and she, as Lauren Bacall. In the dream, he uttered a very famous line to Hermione from one of her favorite books, <em>To Have and Have Not</em>.</p><p>To hear it spoken in Tom’s voice, cracked her heart.<br/>
<br/>
“ <em> I was so sentimental about you I’d break any one’s heart for you. My, I was a damned fool. I broke my own heart, too. It’s broken and gone.” </em></p><p>Hermione slept fitfully that night, and she couldn't escape the sensation of long slender fingers ghosting along her skin.<br/>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Tom stood in a room full of people, immersed in a sea of faces and colorful dresses. There were round tables set up throughout the ballroom, but the banquet was over, the speeches had been made, and the dancing and elbow rubbing had begun. He watched the social dervishes as they eddied around him, feeling much like the eye of a hurricane. He wondered who he might suck into his vortex of destruction.</p><p>He flicked his eyes to Hermione. They stood about twenty feet away, and their company could not have been more polar opposite. She wore an emerald green silk gown that criss-crossed across her delicate back. Her hair was smooth and pulled up in a circle of twisted braids on her head. His eyes traced the delicate gold chain bearing a phoenix and serpent charm, contrasted against the smooth column of her throat. Tom wanted to leave marks on it.</p><p>Cora Greengrass simpered at his side. She’d long had a crush on Tom, and he recalled that he’d made out with her in a spare potions closet in fourth year. She was a shrewd and pretty witch. He’d first considered her in place of Walburga, although she was smarter than Walburga, and she’d had a good deal more self respect.</p><p>Self respect or no, she still wasn’t immune to Tom’s charm.</p><p>Cora had always regretted that Tom had chosen Walburga, and he suspected that she’d been patiently biding her time, awaiting the day when Walburga would marry Orion. </p><p>He slipped an arm around Cora’s waist and he felt her shift closer. </p><p>He seethed inside as he watched Hermione and Gaspard together, despite the fact that there was a healthy distance between them, and Gaspard seemed to be treating her with an appropriate amount of detachment. Still, the two of them were the talk of the banquet. </p><p>“Did you see Dumbledore with Dufresne? I haven’t seen him with a witch in years! Do you suppose they’re newly attached?”</p><p>“But they do make a handsome pair, don’t they?”</p><p>“If the two of them were to link up, they’d be a force to be reckoned with, for sure.”</p><p>It was all anyone could talk about. It nearly outshined the inauguration itself, despite the ball being held at the Tuft Estate. </p><p>Tom couldn’t decipher the auror’s motives. Perhaps his escorting Hermione was a publicity stunt? He suspected Dufresne was in favor of a new wizarding prison, since Tom himself had effectively freed one of Dufresne’s own prisoners from Azkaban. Tom smirked to himself, pleased with himself on that front. </p><p>“Well,” muttered Hepzibah Smith, an older,  pureblooded witch who stood within earshot of Tom. “They would be a power couple, and no mistake. Could you imagine if one of them ran for minister someday? I imagine Britain would never be safer from dark wizards. I even bet the two of them together could put this dark wizard gang away for good! And in a <em> new </em> magical prison too!”</p><p>Tom rolled his eyes. No one seemed to care about the fact that the auror was eighteen years Hermione’s senior. They were all too distracted by the wizard’s tragic sob story.</p><p><em> Yes, yes, very sad </em>, Tom thought without an ounce of compassion. He ground his teeth as he glanced at the auror. The wizard was now talking quietly with Hermione. Dufresne didn’t touch her, but he smiled at her warmly, his eyes lingering on her face as she spoke. Tom could read the interest in his gaze. </p><p><em> Perhaps, it’s not a publicity stunt after all </em>, Tom thought acidly.</p><p>It severely vexed Tom that he couldn’t seem to get other wizards to leave Hermione alone. </p><p>He hadn’t been too concerned with Alphard Black.</p><p>But Dufresne irked him to no end. Perhaps because, unlike Black, the auror was self-made. He had an impressive list of accomplishments, and like Tom himself, he was a half-blood from a rather unsavory familial background and he knew that Hermione would appreciate that kind of audacious ambition. </p><p>He also knew that Hermione was a bleeding heart and would feel sympathy and even tenderness for a man who had lost his wife in such a lamentable manner. </p><p>The man was handsome too, despite his age. As tall as Tom, and, if Tom could make any suppositions about what her type was, he would fit the bill. </p><p>Unbidden, jealousy struck Tom’s chest like a sharp knife. He’d been rather successful in warding off envy or any sense of rivalry thus far, but with their relationship relatively ambiguous of late, coupled with her infuriating refusal to tell him the truth, Tom was feeling quite bitter and resentful. </p><p>He tossed back a glass of firewhiskey, consuming the draught in one gulp as the liquid burned his throat.</p><p>He looked up to find Minister Tuft approaching with a cool smile. </p><p>He flashed her his most dazzling grin. “Wilhemina, congratulations. The night is yours.”</p><p>“Thank you, Riddle,” she breathed charmingly as he leaned in and kissed both her cheeks in the french way.</p><p>“This is Cora Greengrass,” he said, gesturing to his blonde companion.</p><p>Wilhelmina raised her eyebrows at him questioningly, but he shook his head in response to her furtive inquiry.</p><p>She looked back to Cora. “Delightful to meet you Miss Greengrass.” She extended her hand. “Wilhelmina Tuft.”</p><p>As the two witches became acquainted, Tom was approached by Macnair and Corvina Bulstrode. At their side was a diplomat from the French ministry of magic, Pierre Fournier. </p><p>“Good evening, my Lord,” Macnair muttered. He turned to indicate his companion. “May I introduce Monsieur Fournier?”</p><p>Tom extended his hand. The man took it and shook it firmly. “I have been waiting to meet you, Monsieur Riddle. I have been told zat you are a magical force to rival Dumbledore. Is zis true?”</p><p>Tom laughed, his brilliant white teeth shining like razors. “I don’t think Dumbledore and I are even in the same category as far as magic is concerned. How are you finding Britain?”</p><p>“Very welcoming,” he replied. “I have long desired to meet ze old families. I am told you are a close comrade of Radolphus Lestrange?”</p><p>“He is a friend of mine, yes,” Tom answered smoothly, but his eyes wandered elsewhere.</p><p>“Mr. Riddle is quite well acquainted with the pureblood youth in Britain, Pierre,” said Wilhelmina, flicking her eyes at Tom. “All arrows point back to Riddle, it seems.” </p><p>Tom ignored her. He’d spotted Hermione standing alone in a dark corner of the ballroom. She had a glass of champagne resting against her chin and she let her eyes comb the ballroom floor. Tom searched the room and spotted her escort on the floor with a witch bearing an auror badge.</p><p>“Excuse me,” Tom murmured with a charming smile. “I must go say hello to someone." He leaned into the blonde at his side. "Give me a moment, Cora.”</p><p>She smiled and nodded demurely as Tom extricated himself and made his way to the bar to grab a glass of firewhiskey.</p><p>After being stopped by a few more people and being forced to make an appropriate amount of small talk, he slowly made his way across the ballroom toward his target.</p><p>Hermione’s eyes cut over at him when he came to stand at her side, but she didn’t otherwise acknowledge him.</p><p>He took a sip of his firewhiskey. “So, have you told your little auror friend who stole the urn yet?”</p><p>She continued to look ahead, her eyes fixed on a point across the room. “Should I?”</p><p>“Depends,” he muttered. “Trying to send me to Azkaban?”</p><p>She smirked. “Oh, I think we both know that prison could never hold you. Besides, dementors feed on intact souls, and happy memories, and I doubt you’ve got either of those things.”</p><p>Tom’s eyes narrowed. “What do you know about my soul, or my memories?”</p><p>“Nothing,” she said innocently. She lifted her flute of champagne and took a sip. “You haven’t told me much, in truth.”</p><p>He chuckled. “I would tell you anything you want to know, darling, if you agree to shed some light on your past as well. That’s how relationships work, right? It’s a two way street.”</p><p>She swallowed. “Well. That’s not what this is.”</p><p>Tom’s jaw tensed. “What is it, then? Do tell me.”</p><p>She glanced at him and then quickly averted her eyes. “I don’t know.”</p><p>He glared at her, his eyes lit with black fire. “Yes you do, you just don’t want it to be so.”</p><p>She scowled at him. “You want answers from me, Tom? Yet, you lie to me as well. You told me you didn’t steal it, but you did. You want me to <em> commit </em> to you? Tell you I’ll be yours forever? Yet we have completely opposite beliefs and goals, and I know you’d never change those for me. So why do you insist that I pledge some sort of allegiance to you when you have no allegiance to me? Your only <em> true </em>allegiance is to yourself.”</p><p>Tom stared at Hermione. She addressed something that he had no solution for. He was determined that Hermione was his, and that he wanted to keep her. He was set in his decision to bind his soul to hers. She belonged to him. But how to move forward? How would this budding romance work? <em> Was </em> it a romance? No, it was something much deeper. Tom was 99% sure that she was his soulmate. The potion would only satisfy the 1% of doubt he had remaining. </p><p>She made a perfectly reasonable argument. It didn’t change how he felt about her, but it did present him with a dilemma. He hadn’t thought past learning Hermione’s secrets. That had been his sole focus; but once he did, what would there be for them beyond that?</p><p>His followers relied on him to enact their beliefs in the coming years; to take a strong, bloody, violent stance in favor of blood purity standards. To put them in positions of power in his new regime. He’d never thought twice about it before. Part of him had wanted it that way. Mudbloods and muggles… what did Tom care? As long as he was in control and could bring down the statute. He’d possessed such a rage within him toward his father, and toward the muggles he’d grown up around, that he hadn’t really cared either way if he consumed the entire muggle population in fiendfyre and watched them all perish. </p><p>Now, he seriously questioned himself. He questioned if his way was the best way.</p><p>It made him angry. He’d always been rock solid, so sure of himself. Now, he second-guessed everything he’d based his plans upon, and all for a witch who didn’t even trust him enough to tell him the truth. She didn’t deserve his loyalty; and yet, she had it. Hatred flooded his veins like poison.</p><p>He stared back at her with complete revulsion.</p><p>He leaned in and murmured, “Leave your flat unwarded tonight.”</p><p>She held her breath, flicking her eyes over at him. “Why? It’s not like it’s ever been able to keep you out.”</p><p>He scowled at her. “Makes it easier for me.”</p><p>She cocked a brow and crossed her arms over her chest. “What if I don’t want it to be easier for you?”</p><p>Suddenly, Tom turned and advanced on her, backing her against the wall. She glanced around apprehensively, to ensure that nobody was watching. He leaned down to whisper venomously in her ear, “That’s fine, but it will only make it worse for you since I plan to hate fuck you into oblivion.”</p><p>Hermione’s heart stammered, skipping two beats. A powerful thrumming began between her legs almost instantaneously.</p><p>His hand lifted to circle her throat. “I <em> so </em>wish I could slit your throat sometimes, little witch.”</p><p>Hermione swallowed, fear washing over her in the form of a million tiny goosebumps.</p><p>“Fortunately for you, darling, I want you alive more than I want you dead.”</p><p>At that, he jerked away from her and crossed the room in powerful strides, making his way toward Malfoy, Macnair, and their dates, Veda and Corvina Bulstrode.</p><p>Hermione’s heart thundered painfully in her chest. Before she had really recovered, Gaspard returned.</p><p>“I suppose it would be permissible for me to dance with my own date, wouldn’t it?” he asked, extending his hand.</p><p>Hermione took his hand with a nod, and allowed him to lead her onto the ballroom floor. Her eyes searched the crowd for Riddle. When she found him, he was already glaring at her from across the room. He held her gaze for a moment, then looked away coldly. </p><p>She found Gaspard to be a polite, but aloof escort. She couldn’t quite figure him out. He spun them deftly across the dance floor with his hand on her waist. She almost had to crane her head to look at him; he was so incredibly tall that Hermione felt positively dwarfed by him.</p><p>“Can I ask you something, Mr. Dufresne?”</p><p>His blue eyes met hers, and he inclined his head. “Ask away, Miss Dumbledore.”</p><p>“Why did you ask to escort me tonight? Not to be rude, but I’d assumed I wasn’t your favorite person.”</p><p>His tongue darted out and wet his lips before he responded, a smile playing on his full lips. “Truthfully? I was impressed by you, and your ability to uncover so much information about the breach. Many of my own aurors don’t possess that much natural ability. It takes cleverness, attention to detail, and a way with people. People tend to think that all we aurors do is arrest and duel dark wizards, but there’s much more to it than that. To be a successful auror, it takes a variety of skills. It’s rare that an individual possesses all that is required to do the job well.” His icy eyes pierced her. “And if you don’t mind me saying it, I’ve heard about your duel with Walburga Black. It was the talk of the ministry several months ago. If I hadn’t heard it from a source that I trust, I wouldn’t have believed that you cast three spells simultaneously.”</p><p>Her skin pinked somewhat. “I’m sure that they made it sound much grander than it was. I didn’t intend to wound her as gravely as I did.”</p><p>He cocked a brow and tilted his head as he gazed at her. “Not only that, but you also demonstrated quite a bit of skill in healing as well. To seal up lacerations and leave barely a scar; that’s impressive, Hermione.”</p><p>Her cheeks felt hot at the use of her first name. </p><p>“As I’ve said before,” he murmured. “If you would like a position with the auror department, you’d be a great asset.”</p><p>Hermione cleared her throat. “I’ll keep that in mind. Have you learned anymore in your investigation into the robbery?”</p><p>He ran his tongue over his top teeth, a gesture that indicated irritation. “No,” he said flatly. </p><p>As much as Hermione wanted to tell him what she knew, she couldn’t bring herself to betray Tom. Was this what he’d intended? That she be so emotionally entangled in him that she felt guilty about fighting him?</p><p>Walburga Black had been so incredibly deluded about him to the point that she actually thought Riddle would marry her. Was Hermione also this deceived about him?</p><p>Hermione was suddenly overcome by the desire to end her relationship with Riddle. Could she? Would it clear her head enough that she could do what she needed to do?</p><p>She knew she needed to start looking beyond her own emotional gratification in order to ensure the safety and wellbeing of the wizarding world at large. Riddle was a weapon of mass destruction. He was branding his followers with the dark mark. He’d absorbed the power of an ancient dark wizard. He could <em> fly </em>. Apparate across continents. He could break through the strongest magical protections and wards in existence. </p><p>In short, he was powerful. Frighteningly so… and he was capable of causing immeasurable devastation. If Hermione wasn’t careful, she could potentially alter the timeline for the worst.</p><p><em> Especially </em>if she told him the truth. What would he do with the truth, if she told him? If he knew she was from the future? If he knew that she had knowledge of his future? Would he force his way into her mind? What would happen if he discovered they’d destroyed his horcruxes?</p><p>She shivered. Riddle was a wild card. She couldn’t trust him. He was a viper that could easily turn on her and strike when he felt threatened.</p><p>But could she betray him? What would he do if she did? Was there even an auror in all of Britain powerful enough to take on Riddle at this point? Was there a prison that could hold him?</p><p>Once again, Hermione felt that her only chance was to kill him and destroy the ring and journal.</p><p>Her chest tightened and nausea roiled in her stomach at the thought. </p><p>“Well, I wish I could help you with that, Mr. Dufresne.”</p><p>“You can call me Gaspard, Hermione.”</p><p>She smiled and looked away awkwardly. “Okay… Gaspard.”</p><p>He watched her, but his expression was aloof, as always. “Would you like to go for a drink after this, Hermione?”</p><p>Her eyebrows shot up. “A drink?”</p><p>He nodded. “I don’t know about you, but these kinds of events bore me to tears. I’d like to get out of here as quickly as I’m able.”</p><p>She laughed softly. “I have to agree. I’m not a fan of crowds of people, much less politicians and these <em> elite </em>magical social clubs. I sometimes question why I find myself at these types of events so often.”</p><p>His eyes were soft as they rested on her. “It’s because you desire to make a difference, so you do what you must. I understand the sacrifice all too well.” His expression grew pensive.</p><p>Hermione’s eyes roamed his face, confused by the conflicting emotions she began to experience. “I suppose I could go for a drink. As long as it means getting out of here earlier.”</p><p>He nodded, a muted smile playing on his lips. “Good.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Tom was stoic. He was quiet. He fumed.</p><p>He stood with his Death Eaters all around him in a circle, but he said nothing. He allowed them to banter and laugh. </p><p>Hermione had left early with Mr. Head-of-the-DMLE.</p><p>His Death Eaters were still lying to his face and Wilhelmina Tuft had royally pissed him off by mentioning his “secret lover” in front of them.</p><p>Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.</p><p>He thought of carving her up like a Christmas ham.</p><p>He’d had a few too many firewhiskeys and his muscles were taut with anger and tension.</p><p>Tom had become far too used to his nightly trysts with Hermione; that rhythm had been interrupted since the night at Riddle House. Tom was nothing if not a creature of habit. When his rituals and routines were disrupted, it practically threw him into raging neurosis.</p><p>He wanted her. </p><p>The night he’d broken into her flat, she’d promised him.</p><p>His, forever.</p><p>If that was so, then he had every right to see her tonight.</p><p>Tom would deal with his Death Eaters in a few days' time, when the veritaserum had finished brewing.</p><p>Tonight, he only had one goal in mind.<br/><br/></p><hr/><p> </p><p>Gaspard and Hermione sat in a dimly lit corner of a muggle bar. Gaspard revealed that he preferred muggle bars to wizarding ones. He didn’t like to see people he knew.</p><p>Their conversation had waxed deep.</p><p>“I do understand what it feels like to lose someone close to you,” Hermione whispered.</p><p>“It’s fine, Hermione,” Gaspard muttered. “I don’t really like to talk about my wife. You don’t have to try to relate to me. That’s not a requirement.”</p><p>“I’m not, unfortunately,” Hermione replied. “I wish that I could say I don’t relate.”</p><p>Gaspard stared at her. “How did you feel when you discovered Dumbledore was your father?”</p><p>She was quiet for several moments. “Grateful,” she said softly.</p><p>Gaspard nodded once. “He is an incredible wizard. A good friend of mine.”</p><p>“Good to know,” Hermione murmured wryly. She glanced at him. “So why did you ask me for drinks?”</p><p>His eyes met hers and narrowed. He seemed taken aback by her abrupt question. “Should I not have?”</p><p>She took a sip of her wine. “I didn’t say that. I’m just curious.”</p><p> “I thought we could become friends.”</p><p>She rubbed her lips together. “You want to be friends with a twenty-year-old journalist who drives you absolutely bonkers?”</p><p>He smiled and released a breathy chuckle. “Why not?”</p><p>Hermione shrugged. “I’ve another question.”</p><p>“You say that like you need my permission to ask it.”</p><p>“What do you think of Wilhelmina Tuft?”</p><p>His eyes narrowed slightly. “Why do you ask?”</p><p>“Because I want to know.”</p><p>“Is this off the record?”</p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes. “I promise you that I will not publish anything you do not give prior approval for. I’m just asking for myself.”</p><p>His lips twisted to the side. “I don’t think she’s who she pretends to be.”</p><p>Hermione was thoughtful for a moment. “I have to interview her soon. Do you have any advice?”</p><p>He took a sip of his gin. “Just pay very close attention. Read between the lines.”</p><p>They sat across from each other. There was a tangible ease with which they interacted. Hermione felt comfortable in his presence, as if she were at last with an equal, someone who thought as she did and who was equally as dedicated to their work. “Everyone says that you revolutionized the auror department.”</p><p>“I did. The entire DMLE, in fact. All Ministry departments answer to me now.”</p><p>“That’s a bold statement.”</p><p>He snickered. “It’s only bold if it's not true.”</p><p>Hermione’s eyes flicked to his badge, then back to his face, and she found him looking at her with a heated stare. </p><p>“Are you impressed, Hermione?”</p><p>She laughed. “Are you trying to impress me?”</p><p>He ran his tongue along his incisors. “No. Being impressive isn’t all that fun, in actuality. One has to practically give up one’s soul in the process.”</p><p>Hermione took a deep breath. She agreed wholeheartedly with his statement.. “Everyone wants to be a hero until they become one. Then they realize too late that it's quite isolating.”</p><p>His gaze grew thoughtful, and he swallowed. “What happened to you to make you so wise beyond your years, Dumbledore?”</p><p>Her eyebrows lifted. “Maybe I was a hero in another life.”</p><p>He tilted his head. “You could be a hero in this life.”</p><p>“Hmm,” she hummed sadly. “I think I’m too far gone for that.”</p><p>His eyes narrowed, but he said nothing. “Who was the man you were talking with? At the banquet.”</p><p>Her eyes snapped up, widening a fraction. He didn’t look at her suspiciously; he merely seemed curious. Still, she didn’t know quite what to say. Was Tom a lover? A friend? An enemy? The suspect leader of the aforementioned dark wizard gang? </p><p>“Perhaps I shouldn’t have asked,” he murmured. “Forgive me.”</p><p>“Oh no,” she backpedaled. “He’s a friend. I was just trying to think of who you meant.”</p><p>Gaspard took a drink of his gin, finishing off the glass. “It was an innocent question. I’m not here to pursue you, Hermione. I find you interesting, and I enjoy your company. My only motive at this time is to get to know you better. It seems you and I might be working together quite a bit in the foreseeable future. I’d like to know your thoughts, and your leanings. You’re very intelligent, and fearless and I admire that. But like I’ve said, I’m a close friend of your father’s. He’s asked me to keep an eye on you.”</p><p>Her mouth fell open. “He <em> what </em>?”</p><p>His eyes met hers. “He seemed to have concern for your safety.”</p><p>Hermione looked down. “Oh.”</p><p>He watched her searchingly for a moment. “You’ve taken it upon your very delicate shoulders to uncover the existence of a gang of dark wizards. You’ve boldly and quite publicly negated the moral foundation of Britain’s oldest wizarding dynasties. You’ve challenged the bloodthirsty goblins and condemned the treatment of house elves. You’ve castigated the use of dementors as guards and have set into motion the presentiment of revolution.” He gazed at her with intensity. “I think you are seriously undervaluing yourself. You are quite possibly in serious danger. Perhaps I had my own interest in escorting you tonight, I won’t deny that, but make no mistake. Both I and Dumbledore agreed that it would be wise for you to be seen with me publicly.”</p><p>“I see.” Silence filled the space for several moments. Hermione swallowed. “Neither of you thought that perhaps I can take care of myself?”</p><p>The corners of his lips turned up in a faint smile. “It only takes one curse, Hermione. That’s it.” His eyes roamed her face, then flicked down over her body before returning to gaze at her, lit with an icy blue fire. Hermione felt her cheeks heating. “That one curse is usually aimed at your back. I should know. You can’t have eyes everywhere. It would be smart for you to allow someone to watch your back for you.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p align="center"> </p><p><br/>Tom sat on the rooftop of The Tobacconist, a little shop on Horizont Alley that happened to be directly across the street from Hermione’s flat. It was quite nippy out, so Tom wore a heavy cloak, leather gloves, and black dragonhide boots. For good measure, he cast a warming charm on himself. He sat with one foot dangling off the rooftop and the other leg bent with his arm thrown over his knee. The night was clear and provided an unobstructed view of the sky, which appeared like a vast sapphire blanket allowing peeks of the bright light of Olympus on the other side. The stars glittered like gems in the firmament, and Tom pulled upon his expertise in the field of divination to discern what they spoke to him. His eyebrows drew forward sharply, as the particular alignment of the constellations told a foreboding tale of separation and anguish. Tom hoped he was reading it wrong. He was no seer, nor was he the most skilled diviner. </p><p>He withdrew his cigarettes from his cloak and lit one. </p><p>His eyes flicked down to the phone booth on the sidewalk. He’d stayed at the banquet schmoozing the purebloods well after Hermione had left, and yet she still wasn’t home. He decided he would give it another thirty minutes before he went looking for her. It was grating on his nerves significantly that his witch had been bold enough to run off with Dufresne after he’d informed her of his intentions. She knew that he was expecting her. He thought with some irritation that she had probably done it on purpose, just to spite him.</p><p>Tom had dark energy coursing through his person and he could feel it begging to be let out. He cracked his neck in an attempt to relieve his edginess.</p><p>It was then that Tom caught sight of them. Hermione and Gaspard apparated into sight just across the street from the bright red phone booth. He couldn’t hear what was said, but Dufresne leaned in and gave Hermione a lingering hug before she entered the phone booth and dialed in.</p><p>After Hermione was gone, the auror stood staring at the phone booth for a moment in contemplation. After several minutes, he ran a hand over his face and turned on his heel, apparating away.</p><p>Tom was both frustrated and relieved. Frustrated that she’d been with the auror this entire time, but relieved that the old man had kept his fucking hands to himself.</p><p>Tom lifted the cigarette to his lips and inhaled deeply, letting the smoke saturate his lungs like holy incense, depleting the oxygen from his cells. Then, he exhaled like a prayer. </p><p>Tom reveled in the tension building within his muscles, the precursor to future motion, as if he were a snake coiled to strike. He watched the light turn on in her bedroom window.</p><p>Tom withdrew his parchment from his robes, along with a muggle fountain pen that Hermione had given him. He found them much more convenient than quills and decided he agreed with Hermione’s assessment of muggle inventions and the value they could bring to the wizarding world. Tom was quite practical, when it came down to it, and could acknowledge when a proper argument had been made.</p><p>He scrawled a message onto the parchment, then laid it beside him as he flicked the ash from his cigarette.</p><p>________________________</p><p> </p><p>Hermione was absolutely knackered as she took her nightly elixir, then brushed her teeth and washed her face. She didn’t even bother to pull the pins from her hair, which was braided and twisted into an elegant updo. She left it alone and slipped on one of Tom’s shirts, buttoning it up. He’d left a couple of them at her flat over the past few months and she found they were her favorite article of clothing to sleep in. She was a little embarrassed by how much comfort she derived from wearing them. She hadn’t washed this particular one yet, because it still smelled like him.</p><p>She sighed and shook her head.</p><p>Their relationship was in a type of stalemate. She stubbornly refused to relinquish her hold on her memories, albeit for good reason, and she was positive that he wouldn’t deviate from his destructive course for the sake of a romantic affair. For that reason, their entanglement was now ambiguous at best. Despite that, Hermione found it difficult to let go. </p><p>At some point, she would have to. The thought filled her with sadness, and she didn’t know why.</p><p>Gaspard had taken her by surprise tonight. She was quite amazed at how much she enjoyed his company, by how at ease she felt in his presence. She’d become used to the somewhat bold attentions of wizards in this time, but Gaspard was aloof and guarded. He seemed much more concerned with getting to know her on a personal level than pursuing her as a romantic interest, which, to Hermione’s surprise, she found quite attractive. Perhaps, a more mature wizard in his late thirties would be a refreshing change of pace.</p><p>Despite that, Hermione couldn’t help feeling a bit disappointed when she’d arrived at her flat at this late hour, to find it still warded and empty. She’d expected Riddle to be here waiting for her. She rolled her eyes, angry at herself for wanting to see him. </p><p>Hermione crossed the room and reached for the book she’d left open on her desk. She decided to do a bit of light reading before bed to get herself inspired to write her next article.</p><p>As she picked up the book, her eyes fell on Riddle’s unfurled parchment where it lay on her desk. There was a sharp scrawl of ink across the paper. Hermione bit her bottom lip and reached for it, dropping her book back on the desk.</p><p>
<em> Welcome home, little witch. Did you enjoy yourself?  </em>
</p><p>Hermione’s brow furrowed and her head whipped around, checking to see if he might be somehow hiding somewhere in her room.</p><p>She wrote back, <em> How did you know I’m home? </em></p><p>After a moment, another message appeared. </p><p>
<em> What are you wearing? </em>
</p><p>She rolled her eyes at his pointedly ignoring her question. </p><p>Hermione rolled her lip between her teeth. Despite her frustration with him, she found herself craving his touch. Tom Riddle was a drug more addictive than her elixirs. She’s gotten used to seeing him every night and the past week it felt as if he’d been ripped from her, leaving her uncomfortably bare and alone.</p><p>She contemplated her reply. </p><p>Why shouldn’t she sleep with him? </p><p>It’s not like she owed him anything.</p><p>She’d made that clear to him tonight. Their goals and aspirations were far too different for their dalliance to evolve into a long-term relationship.</p><p>“Never try to change someone,” her mom had always told her. “People never really change, and you could lose yourself in the process.”</p><p>She’d have to eventually break away from him in order to do what needed to be done. </p><p>
<em> Why don't you come find out?  </em>
</p><p>She wrote her response and climbed into bed, taking the parchment with her.</p><p>A moment later, his answer appeared.</p><p>
<em> Do you think you’re in control here, little witch? Answer my question. </em>
</p><p>Hermione shook her head. <em> Arrogant sod </em>, she thought. She took up her pen and responded, determined to tease him into insanity.</p><p>
<em> I’m more in control than you think, Tom.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> P.S. I’m wearing your shirt... Nothing underneath. </em>
</p><p>She pressed her lips together to keep from smiling.</p><p>His reply took longer to manifest. After a few moments, his familiar spiky letters etched across the parchment.</p><p>
<em> You’re wearing my clothes now? </em>
</p><p>She smirked and penned a response.</p><p><em> Don’t read into it. I couldn’t find anything else, </em>she wrote.</p><p>His reply came quickly.</p><p>
<em> Lies. Missing me, darling? </em>
</p><p>Hermione’s heart beat erratically, and little butterflies quavered in her stomach as she responded.</p><p>
<em> Not at all. </em>
</p><p>She held her breath as she waited. He’d typically used the parchment to relay messages, to alert her to his changes of plans, and sometimes to communicate with her during the day at work. They had rarely used the parchment to chat late at night like this… because they were usually together.</p><p>His answer materialized slowly on the paper.</p><p>
<em> Keep lying to me. It just makes me want to ruin you. </em>
</p><p>Hermione’s breathing halted. Her eyelids fluttered as she bit her lip. She marveled at his ability to evoke a visceral reaction in her body with so few words. Her body thrummed with anticipation as she wrote him back.</p><p>
<em> Good thing you’re not here, then. </em>
</p><p>She knew she was baiting him, but it was too enticing to resist. </p><p>The air was tense with pause as she waited.</p><p>His reply appeared gradually on the parchment.</p><p>
<em> Take off your knickers. </em>
</p><p>Her eyes widened.</p><p>She swallowed, then wrote back,<em> I told you. I’m not wearing any. </em></p><p>She suddenly wanted to hear his voice. To see his face. She wondered if he would really come as he’d promised, or if he would merely tease her like the evil brute that he was.</p><p>After a moment, she watched his answer appear.</p><p>
<em> So what you’re saying is, you were prepared for me? That’s very cute, Hermione. </em>
</p><p>She bit her lip, fighting a smirk. As she was pondering her response, a second message from him appeared.</p><p>
<em> Perhaps I should take it easy on you. But then again, I’m not feeling very merciful tonight.  </em>
</p><p>Was it the menacing tone of his message that had her heart in her throat? Was it the impatience he exuded that had her feeling ravenous? She realized with some chagrin that she had been waiting for this moment all night, ever since he whispered in her ear at the banquet. She’d thought of it as she prolonged her time at the bar with Gaspard… dragging out the anticipation because she loved the self-torture. </p><p>Hermione marveled at how much she’d changed since the war began. As a child, she’d always followed the rules as much as possible. She’d believed in goodness and that light would always win. </p><p>But the war had transformed her. She’d seen things she never thought she would encounter in her lifetime and suddenly her entire system of morality was grey and blurred. The foundation was the same, but the tower upon which it was built now had holes and chinks in its armor. What would her younger self say if she knew Hermione was now casually flirting with the man who had wrecked her whole world?</p><p>It should make her feel sick, but it didn’t, and that bothered Hermione more than anything.</p><p>More words materialized on the paper.</p><p>
<em> Put the pen down and follow my instructions. </em>
</p><p>Hermione cocked her head as she read the message.</p><p>A moment later, the parchment revealed another note.</p><p>
<em> Slide your finger inside yourself. </em>
</p><p>Hermione’s mouth fell open, eyes wide. The pulsing between her legs intensified. As she re-read the words on the paper, they disappeared and another message surfaced.</p><p>
<em> Don't think about it, Hermione. Just do it.  </em>
</p><p>How did he know she’d hesitated? At this point, she was convinced he must be watching her. Hermione bit her lip, but her breath became taut as she obeyed his instructions, her hand wandering between her legs. As she slid her finger inside herself, she realized the gesture felt far more erotic than it normally would’ve, simply because he’d commanded her to do it.</p><p> She watched his handwriting appear across the parchment.</p><p>
<em> I bet you’re wet. I can taste you on my tongue while I write this. </em>
</p><p><em> Merlin, </em>Hermione thought. </p><p>She picked up the pen and wrote back. <em> Are you watching me? </em></p><p>After a moment, she saw his response materialize.</p><p>
<em> I told you to put the pen down. </em>
</p><p>With a roll of her eyes, she laid it aside, more out of curiosity than anything, and almost immediately, he responded.</p><p>
<em> Good girl. </em>
</p><p>Hermione’s breath caught as she pumped her finger in and out, wishing he would come and make good on his promise from earlier that night.</p><p>
<em> Rub your clit, Hermione. Slowly. </em>
</p><p>Hermione did as he asked, and something about giving herself over to his commands made the pleasure exponentially more intense. The fact that he might be watching her made her heart pound.</p><p>His words spiked across the paper in dark ink.</p><p>
<em> You fight me, little witch, but deep down, I know you love to give in. You love how it feels to obey, because you’re a good girl. It’s tempting for me to use that to make you do very, very bad things for me. </em>
</p><p>Her lips parted and she felt heat creeping into her cheeks and spreading down her chest. </p><p>More words appeared.</p><p>
<em> I’m going to fuck you until you scream.  </em>
</p><p>Her breath caught and she stopped for a moment as she read his words over again. They quickly disappeared to be replaced with another message.</p><p>
<em> Did I tell you to stop? </em>
</p><p>Again, she flicked her eyes around the room, wondering how he could possibly be watching her when he wasn’t even in the room.</p><p>That made her nervous. If <em> that </em>was possible, what else had he seen when she wasn’t aware he was watching?</p><p>“Tom?” she breathed shakily.</p><p>A moment later, more writing appeared on the parchment.</p><p>
<em> What, baby? </em>
</p><p>Hermione gasped and sat upright. Her breathing was heavy and her heart thudded violently against her ribcage. Fear washed over her as a shiver went down her spine. Her head whipped around, searching the room. She stood up and checked her closet, but he wasn’t there.</p><p>She slowly made her way back to the bed to find another note waiting for her.</p><p>
<em> Are you scared, little witch? </em>
</p><p>She shook her head. “No,” she breathed, but her hands trembled.</p><p>
<em> You should be. </em>
</p><p>As soon as the words appeared on the paper, Hermione bolted from the room, her adrenaline pumping wildly, but as soon as she made it across the threshold, she ran smack into Riddle.</p><p>The lights went out, leaving them in blackness.</p><p>Hermione screamed and jerked away from him, but something wrapped itself around her wrists and feet, tightly constricting her movement. </p><p>“Let me <em> go </em>, Tom,” she huffed, but he bent down and threw her over his shoulder, carrying her back into the bedroom.</p><p>“Absolutely not, little witch,” he muttered, a dangerous edge lacing in his voice.</p><p>Bright green flames flared to life in the fireplace, providing the only light in the dark room.</p><p>Riddle tossed her onto the bed and she struggled against the phantom binds on her wrists as he leaned over her, his arms braced on either side of her. The flames cast an eerie green glow on his face, and his lips pulled back in a sinister grin.</p><p>“What are you doing, Tom?” she asked tremulously, her mouth dry.</p><p>He said nothing, but gazed at her as he lifted his hand and ran his palm from her knee to her thigh, then slid beneath the shirt to stroke her bare hip.</p><p>“You’re so beautiful when you’re afraid, darling,” came his deep voice, hoarse with lust.</p><p>Hermione swallowed. Something in his demeanor made her hackles rise. “Are you going to kill me, Tom?”</p><p>He chuckled. The sound was terrifying. “Why would I want to kill you, little witch? You’re too much fun for me, alive. I do wonder, though, why is it that you think I would want to kill you? Is it perhaps because you're a time traveler?”</p><p>Hermione froze. Their eyes locked and she stopped breathing.</p><p>“Oh yes, Hermione. I know. At least you weren’t lying about your Hogwarts house, but you were lying when you said you never went to Hogwarts, weren’t you?”</p><p>Hermione’s eyes widened and she searched his face. Then, without warning, she began thrashing against him. No matter how she struggled, she couldn’t break the magical bonds.</p><p>“Please, Tom, let me go,” she whispered, her lips trembling. Her fear was suddenly very tangible; she hadn’t felt it this strongly since she’d seen Harry’s lifeless body in Hagrid’s arms. </p><p>“Stop struggling, Hermione. Be still, or I’ll have to force you.” The binds tightened around her wrists and ankles until they bit into her skin.</p><p>Her chest heaved. Her expression twisted into one of grief as she looked at him. </p><p>This was it. The moment she’d feared would come, and she wasn’t prepared for it. She’d known from the onset of their arrangement that it would one day transform into “kill or be killed,” but she hadn’t anticipated it to come so suddenly.</p><p>Tom’s jaw muscles flexed as he looked down at her. “Why do you look at me like that, Hermione? Tell me now.”</p><p>She tried to regulate her breathing. She shook her head as she rasped, “Look at you like <em> what </em>?”</p><p>His adam’s apple bobbed in his throat. “Like I’m a vampire who’s about to devour you.”</p><p>Hermione said nothing. She couldn’t make her lips form words; her mouth refused to function properly. She was utterly paralyzed with fear.</p><p>How had she convinced herself that this could work? She’d foolishly been sleeping with the most evil dark wizard of the century, completely lulled into a sense of normalcy when in reality, he was still every bit as much of a threat as he had been in her time. She’d known better, and yet, she had made the wrong decisions anyway.</p><p>She’d completely failed her friends.</p><p>“I went to Riddle House, Hermione. Had a little chat with my old pal Frank. Well, it was a short chat before I searched his mind and found an interesting memory from February. Any guesses what it was?”</p><p>Hermione’s lips parted. Her pupils were blown wide as she stared at him in terror. This was it. Had she honestly thought he wouldn’t put it together? That she could lie to him for so long? </p><p>“I’ve been very patient, Hermione. Can you honestly say that I haven’t?”</p><p>She shook her head, unable to speak. </p><p>His eyes narrowed around the black holes of his irises, and he cocked his jaw to the side. “You know what I think, Hermione? I think you’re self-righteous as fuck. You’ve convinced yourself that I’m <em> evil </em>and not worth your trust, and yet you’ve been fucking me every night and leading me to believe that I might actually mean something to you. When in reality, I don’t mean shit to you, do I? If I did, then you’d tell me the truth. I’ve asked you nicely and I’ve waited patiently, like a gentleman, but perhaps I shouldn’t be a gentleman with you anymore. We’re not in a relationship, you said so yourself tonight.” He began to unbuckle his belt. “You’re not my girlfriend, right? Then perhaps I should treat you like my whore. That’s what you are, then, isn’t it?”</p><p>Hermione’s mouth fell open. “I hate you,” she spat. “I can’t believe you get off on this.”</p><p>Tom smirked. “I think you can’t believe how easily <em> you </em>get off on this.” For effect, he reached between her legs and brushed two fingers against her entrance, then slipped them inside her, pumping them in and out to produce a wet sound. He grinned as heat rose to Hermione’s cheeks. “Does it make you question everything about yourself? To know that you want me as badly as I want you?”</p><p>Hermione looked at him in abject horror.</p><p>Tom laughed. “Why so shocked?” He gripped her around her throat. “I’d love nothing more than to treat you like a slut. I’ve been holding back, truth be told. Do you think I’ve ever treated a witch with respect before? You were a first for me. But perhaps I should let the beast out. This <em> is </em>who you believe me to be, is it not ? Someone evil and unhinged, not worthy of your trust. Not worthy to escort you to your bloody banquets.”</p><p>She shook her head frantically, angry tears filling her eyes. “That’s not fair. You wouldn’t be caught dead with me in public, Tom, and you know it. What would your pureblood lapdogs think if they saw us together?”</p><p>His face twisted with frustration. “Do you honestly think I give a damn what my followers think? They answer to <em> me </em> . I do not answer to <em> them </em> .” He scowled at her venomously. “I want you <em> with </em>me, Hermione. Why can’t we do this together?”</p><p>She stared at him incredulously. “<em>Together</em>? How? I could never condone what you stand for. <em> Never.</em>”</p><p>He gazed back coldly. “Would it be better if I took a cushy job at the ministry? Would that make you happy? What is it that you want, Hermione? A picket fence and a baby like your Weasley friends?” His eyes ignited with the flames of malice. “What do you have against me seeking <em> greatness</em>?”</p><p>Her eyes flew wide open as she strained against the invisible bonds. “You can be great without <em> murdering </em> people, Tom! Without promoting and partnering with <em> bigots</em>!”</p><p>His eyes narrowed and he leaned closer. “Oh, really? Who do <em> you </em> know who's truly <em> powerful</em>, Hermione? <em> Who</em>?”</p><p>“My father is great <em> and </em>powerful,” she snapped. </p><p>“True, but is he <em> even </em>your father?” he bit out. His ethereal eyes flashed with anger as he searched her face.</p><p>Her mouth shut abruptly. </p><p>He stared at her, his obsidian eyes shining with something akin to anguish. “I’m going to be brutally honest, <em>my love</em>. I think you’re a hypocrite. I don’t think you’re any better than me. I know you. I can see into your soul, and I know that you can’t help feeling drawn to me, because although we are opposites, we are also the same, and I know you want me just as <em> obsessively </em> as I want you. So you can stop pretending to be the perfect, saintly little witch that we both know you are not.” The angles of his face sharpened in rage. “I hate your <em> fucking </em>lies. You are like poison in my veins, Hermione. You’re not just lying to me, but to yourself as well. You can’t even be truthful with yourself and admit how you feel about me. That’s what I love about filling you with my cum every night. I can fuck you until you have no choice but to scream my name and that, Hermione, feels like honesty to me. Together, you and I are pure truth. It’s a beautiful thing.”</p><p>Tears slipped from the corner of Hermione’s eyes as they mirrored his. His gaze tracked them as they rolled down her cheeks. </p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>“Tom, I-” </p><p>She couldn’t finish. She choked on her words.</p><p>He stared at her unforgivingly. </p><p>She could barely get the words out. “I’m… I’m not ready to tell you. I can’t… not yet. I’m sorry.”</p><p>Tom watched her for a moment, then he swallowed. “Why?”</p><p>Her breathing grew jagged. She thought she might hyperventilate. “I…” She sucked in a breath. Then another. “Because I’m <em> terrified </em>of you,” she rasped, her voice strangled and void of sound.</p><p>His brows drew forward sharply. </p><p>He searched her face for a moment before reaching up and wiping the tears from her cheeks with his fingertips. “Breathe, Hermione.”</p><p>She regulated her breathing as he brushed the loose, wispy tendrils of her curls from her face, his cool fingertips stroking her face until she’d calmed.</p><p>“Hermione,” he sighed. “I have far more to fear from you than you ever have from me. I don’t know why you cannot see it.”</p><p>“I can’t tell you, Tom,” she sobbed. “I <em> can’t</em>. Please… please, I need time.”</p><p>Tom slid his tongue over his top teeth. Her binds loosened all at once, freeing her wrists and ankles. After a moment, Tom took a deep breath. “If time is what you need… then time is what you shall have.” His jaw tensed. “Even if it destroys me.”</p><p>His eyes roamed her anguished face, illuminated by the low light of the flickering green flames. She gazed back at him, her  whiskey brown eyes brimming with tears. </p><p>Her eyes fell shut, and the remaining tears slid in rivulets down her cheeks.</p><p>Tom pushed her legs apart. “I don’t want to break you, Hermione… but I feel that you might break me.”</p><p>He slowly took off his leather gloves and tossed them aside. Then he removed his cloak as well.</p><p>She kept her eyes closed as his fingers wandered between her legs. His eyes focused on her face as he touched her, observing the way her lips parted softly as he slid his fingers inside her. </p><p>Then he kissed her. Her lips tasted salty and sinful, and Tom felt the unforgiving stone of his heart begin to fracture. He tilted his head, slanting his mouth as he deepened the kiss, his tongue capturing hers like a foreign invader. His hips moved between her thighs and she felt his erection straining against his trousers. Hermione moaned against his lips, sending vibrations through them both that served to drive Tom mad.</p><p>He reached between them and unzipped his trousers, and soon she felt the stiff heat of his cock pressed to her entrance. He teased her slit, sliding his head up and down her slick opening and then rubbing slow circles around her clit. </p><p>She broke the kiss with a gasp, her mouth falling open as the anticipation became unbearable. Her fingers moved quickly to unbutton his shirt, then she ran her hands over the planes of his chest.</p><p>“Hermione,” Tom whispered against her cheek, his hot breath caressing her skin. “You drive me fucking crazy. Do you have any idea what you do to me?”</p><p>Hermione writhed beneath him. Her core was flooded with heat and sensitive to the point of torture. The pulsing became excruciating, her warm liquid coating his tip as she wrapped her arms around his neck and bucked her hips against his. “Tom, <em> please</em>. I want you. Stop teasing me.”</p><p>His mouth snatched at hers as he finally buried himself inside her with one powerful thrust. She cried out, the pleasure rocketing through her as if her body were a conduit. He pulled back and then slammed into her again, forcing a whimper from her throat. Her head fell to the side as she completely lost control, but he gripped her jaw and turned her head to face him, his fingers biting into her cheeks. “Eyes on me, baby.”</p><p>Their eyes met in a connection between souls, communicating something more deeply than words ever could. His body spoke to her with each thrust, his fingertips whispering along her skin, betraying his intentions with the voracity of his movements.</p><p>“Do you care about me, Tom?” She hadn’t meant to ask them, but the words fell softly from her lips before she could stop them.</p><p>His fingers interlocked with hers as he pinned her with a heated gaze. “Yes, Hermione. More than you realize.”</p><p>Her breath poured forth shakily from her lungs. His answer both terrified her and brought relief to her all at once.</p><p>His hand snaked beneath her shirt to palm her breast, rolling her nipple between his thumb and index finger. “What does the name Voldemort mean to you, Hermione?”</p><p>Her breath caught. She averted her eyes as fear caused her heart rate to spike, but he said sternly, “Look at me, Hermione.”</p><p>Her eyes flicked back to his. He lifted her leg, shifting the angle of his thrusts until his strokes were maddeningly deep. “Oh my god,” she whimpered, the flames of pleasure fanning out through her core.</p><p>“Tell me,” he growled.</p><p>Her head fell back and she cried out, her walls tightening around him. He purposely slowed his movements, his long fingers wrapping around her throat and squeezing gently. </p><p>“Voldemort,” she breathed, “is the person I fear most in the world.”</p><p>Time seemed to stand still.</p><p>Tom froze, a statue of stone. His own heart beat rapidly as she confirmed what he’d feared.</p><p>He swallowed. “I won’t ask anything else until you’re ready to tell me... only answer one more question for me.”</p><p>Her eyes widened, searching his face. The terror showed palpably in her expression.</p><p>His hand moved to take hers, then he flipped her arm over. With a wave of his hand, the enchantment upon her scar disappeared. </p><p>Hermione gasped and jerked in an attempt to twist away from him, but his hold was unbreakable.</p><p>“Did I have something to do with this?” he asked.</p><p>Shock registered in her face. “You knew? For how long?”</p><p>“Yes, I've known. Answer the question, Hermione.”</p><p>Her lips parted and her chest heaved. She nodded as she searched his face nervously. "Yes."</p><p>His eyes fell shut and he released his breath. Then, he bowed his head dejectedly.</p><p>“Fuck,” he murmured, his mouth dry.</p><p>She threaded her hands in his hair, then pulled his head back. Their eyes met, but his were unreadable.</p><p>“Please, Tom. Not yet. We don’t have to go there yet. Just be with me right now… please.”</p><p>His jaw tensed, but he began to move again. He entered her slowly as he reached between them to circle her clit with the pads of his fingers. His mouth found her throat, his tongue tracing along her jugular vein before dipping into the hollow of her throat. He sucked gently on the sensitive skin there, then let his teeth drag along her shoulder. </p><p>His fingers hooked into the collar of her shirt, then jerked, ripping it open as the buttons popped. He waved his hand and the ghastly scar caused by Dolohov’s curse suddenly became visible, every concealment charm melting away.</p><p>Hermione gasped. Tom’s eyes roved her chest, taking in the full scope of the remnants of the curse. Then, he dipped his head, his mouth meeting her skin as his tongue traced the length of the scar. Hermione shivered at the sensation. </p><p>He drove into her, his speed quickening as he thrust harder.</p><p>His breath was hot against her ear as he whispered, “If you honestly think I could kill you, you’re gravely mistaken, little witch. You’re like an arrow in my soul. If I pull you out, I’ll bleed to death.”</p><p>“You don’t care?” she breathed tremulously, unable to mask her shock. “That I’m muggleborn?”</p><p>Tom’s strokes became forceful and rapid. She moved against him as they each chased release. “Fuck blood purity. Fuck them all, little witch. You’re mine.”</p><p>Hermione’s heart stopped. She clung to him as she moaned against the base of his throat. They climbed the mountain of rapture together, violently drawing pleasure from one another as their heartbeats pounded in tandem. He thrust so hard that he had to yank her back by her hips with each stroke, his fingers digging into her soft flesh.</p><p>Hermione arched against him as he hit a certain spot deep inside her, over and over again. It built slowly into a numb and all-encompassing euphoria. It was nothing like the orgasms she gave herself, nothing like the quick, thin reams of release wrung out of her by her small fingers. Her face twisted into an expression of torturous bliss.</p><p>“That’s it, baby. Give me that face,” he rasped. “You look so fucking pretty when you come.”</p><p>Hermione thought his voice was sexiest when laced with lust. She coveted his whispers in her ear, urging her on, encouraging her to lose control. He was suddenly not just inside her, but all around her, his scent a mixture of spearmint, parchment, amber and smoke that pounded through her senses as her body ate it up greedily. </p><p>Her legs began to shake, going numb from the building pressure as heat ripped through her core. She felt her vision begin to darken, heart stuttering, her mouth falling open as she choked on air.</p><p>“Not yet, princess. Hold onto it. Don’t you fucking come until I say.”</p><p>“Tom… <em> please… </em>” she begged, arching back as her toes curled from the effort.</p><p>He bit his bottom lip as he smirked down at her, his eyes drinking in the red that spread across her chest and throat, the obvious difficulty with which she constricted her breathing, laboring to adhere to his command. The only thing that drove him to distraction more than her begging was her obedience. </p><p>“Bloody hell, witch,” he muttered as he felt his muscles tightening. He sat back on his knees and gripped her thighs, lifting her hips as he drilled into her.</p><p>“Open your mouth,” he instructed. When her lips parted, he slid his fingers over her tongue and watched as she wrapped her lips around them and sucked on each digit, issuing a throaty moan as she did so. Their eyes met, and she intently rolled her eyes back in her head, eliciting a groan from his chest. “Oh, <em> fuck</em>, yes,” he whispered lustfully. "That's my girl."</p><p>Hermione flushed pink at the praise.</p><p>“Are you struggling, little witch?” Tom smirked as she twisted and writhed beneath him, but he just railed her harder, hitting her sweet spot over and over, reveling in the control he held over her body. “You belong to me, Hermione. You’re mine.” He leaned over her and whispered in a hushed voice, "If anyone touches you, I'll burn them alive."</p><p>It took all of Hermione’s focus to stop the tidal wave of ecstasy from consuming her whole. Not even her wildest fantasies were capable of racking her body with the kind of pleasure that Tom wrung from her now. Her chest constricted tightly as she held her breath against the mounting explosion. Her legs were shaking, and she reached out to dig her nails into his chest, just to have <em> something </em>to anchor her. “I want to be yours, Tom,” came her ragged whisper. “I do… it’s my deepest wish.”</p><p>In that moment, no part of her resisted those words, and she realized that he was right. Their coming together felt like pure truth. That admission felt like the most honest thing she’d ever said.</p><p>Her fingers threaded in his inky black hair as he leaned down and covered her lips with his. After a moment, she broke the kiss to moan, “I’m coming, Tom. I can’t stop it.”</p><p>The pressure was so great in her body that it had become a mixture of pain and pleasure. She felt his cock stiffening within her with each stroke, and she could feel the bulge of each vein within her as he chased the same release. Hermione felt a sense of pride that the glaze in his black eyes was caused by the pleasure he was taking from her.</p><p>He leaned over her and laid his hand around her throat. The metal of his horcrux was cold against her throat. “Come for me, little witch. I want to watch you.” His left hand reached between them and he began to rub her clit in circular motion. The moment he touched her there, she was gone. The orgasm ripped through her and she arched back with an agonized cry. </p><p>His name burst from her lips; she had no idea where it came from, because it sounded like an echo from somewhere far outside of herself. She had no awareness of anything else around her; only the sharp pounding of pleasure between her thighs as it radiated throughout her entire body.</p><p>A moment later, she heard his growl against her ear, a muttered, “Fuck,” and then the stutter of his hips, and she felt the hard pulse of his cock throbbing inside her, filling her with his spend in one violent thrust.</p><p>She moaned as she felt its warmth flooding her, her body welcoming it with some animalistic instinct that defied logic. It knew no pride or dignity; it craved nothing but Tom, a base impulse that wanted every part of him.</p><p>Her body moved against his, molded to him as he gently thrust into her one, two, three more times before pulling out. His breathing was heavy and his hand shook as he reached for his wand. He paused, then glanced at her. Their eyes locked. Some level of awareness returned to Hermione, because she muttered huskily, “I hope you know I can cast the spell now. So don’t try anything funny.”</p><p>He chuckled in his deep tenor and the sound licked through her like a blazing fire. “I’ve told you, Hermione. I wouldn’t do anything without your consent. Besides, I don’t know what year you’ve come from, but in 1948, I think it’d be best if you took my last name before I knock you up.”</p><p>Hermione’s eyes snapped wide open and she sputtered in disbelief. “<em>Excuse</em> me? Have I given you any reason to think I would <em> ever </em> marry you? Are you insane? What name are you even referring to? Do you think I would actually relish becoming <em>Mrs</em>. Lord Voldemort?” </p><p>His lips spread back over his brilliant teeth in a devastating grin. “Of course not. You’d simply be Mrs. Riddle.”</p><p>“Never going to happen… and I’m not  spawning with you, either.”</p><p>He leaned forward until their breaths mingled, a slight smile playing on his lips. “Shutup, Hermione.” Then, he leaned forward and kissed her, and all at once she forgot his teasing.</p><p>Despite being the powerful dark lord that he was, he kissed her with all the humanity of a mortal worshiping a goddess. All Hermione could feel was the innate sense of being one with him in a mutual ascension, and she kissed him back, deeply in awe of the space in time that they’d carved out for themselves.</p>

<p>Tom woke early the next morning. Hermione was fast asleep, and he laid beside her for a while, his eyes tracing the scars on her arm and chest. It was Sunday and they were both free for the day. Hermione typically met with Dumbledore, but the old wizard was out of the country on some kind of Hogwarts business. Tom quietly got out of bed and donned his trousers. He hoped Hermione would sleep for a while yet so that he could process his thoughts about their conversation the previous night.</p><p>He entered the kitchen and began brewing coffee.</p><p>He’d had a plan last night, and while his plan hadn’t gone exactly as he’d hoped, he had gained quite a bit of valuable information from his witch. He was still itching to learn everything she was hiding, but he was a patient man. Once he’d seen the look of pure terror in her eyes, Tom knew he would need to work harder to gain her trust. He would need to be vulnerable and gentle with her. </p><p>He’d learned that whatever torture Hermione had endured was at least partly, if not completely, his fault. That reality made Tom physically sick. He shoved that down to re-examine later. He had a plan to execute today and couldn’t afford to be distracted.</p><p>He’d learned that she was, in all likelihood, not related to Albus Dumbledore. But then, where had the Phoenix come from? </p><p>He’d learned that whatever Tom had become in this ambiguous future timeline, he had likely achieved many of his goals. She feared him. Voldemort. More than anyone else in the world. Isn’t that what he’d vowed to himself? That one day, every witch and wizard would fear his name.</p><p>Learning that little tidbit didn’t feel as good as he thought it should. Not when the witch he cared about shrunk away from him as if she thought he would strangle her with his bare hands. So many times over the past few months, she had randomly become skittish and paranoid, as if she were waiting for him to turn and curse her. Now he partially understood why. </p><p>They were enemies.</p><p>Which explained her initial fear when they’d bumped into one another in Diagon Alley. </p><p>Suddenly, every interaction they’d ever had began to play over in Riddle’s mind. He saw each conversation, each touch, each kiss, from Hermione’s point of view. No wonder she’d fought against him so hard. No wonder she carried such guilt. </p><p>But he wanted to know more. <em> Why </em>did she feel guilty? What has become of him in the future? What had he done to make her feel so terrified? How would her being here affect the future? </p><p>It was maddening. Not knowing.</p><p>Still, he felt it was a step in the right direction. Now, she knew that he was aware of where she’d come from. Perhaps, with proper handling of these secrets, he could earn her trust and learn more. </p><p>Suddenly, a thought struck Tom.</p><p>Did Hermione know about his horcruxes?</p><p>It was unlikely. He hadn’t told a soul about them, and he didn’t plan to divulge the information to any of his followers. It was nearly impossible for her to know about them, but yet…</p><p>A plan began to formulate in Riddle’s mind.</p><p>When the proper time came, he would test her. </p><p>An image bloomed in Riddle’s mind, a vision of her arm, etched with the ghastly cuts that formed “Mudblood.”</p><p>Tom was still conflicted about it.</p><p>“Fuck blood purity,” he’d said, and his words had even shocked him. </p><p>He was saying and doing things he didn’t understand.</p><p>He’d killed his basilisk. Was he turning his back on the ideology he’d held aloft for so many years? Was he turning his back on Slytherin, his ancestor, the idol he’d placed on a pedestal for the majority of his life?</p><p>Tom knew that there was nothing fundamentally better about being pureblooded, despite the beliefs espoused by his death eaters. If that were true, then the muggle blood that ran in his veins should severely hinder his magical ability. Yet none of his pureblooded contemporaries could best him magically, nor strategically. </p><p>How could he hold it against Hermione that her parents were muggles? He couldn’t. She was more magically competent than any of his death eaters. She was brilliant, well-read, and thought both deeply and critically. He was consistently impressed by her, which was no small accomplishment.</p><p>Did her blood status change what he believed about muggleborns as a whole? He wasn’t sure.</p><p>It was more so the danger that muggles and muggleborns presented to wizardkind that created the issue. He would have to find a way around it. Otherwise, he and Hermione would be at odds. That is, unless he could sway Hermione to side with him. That would take quite a bit of convincing on his part.</p><p>His death eaters hoped he would eventually exterminate muggleborns and bring muggle society to its knees. He’d never questioned those goals before, because they served his darker purposes. But now? Tom would have to recalibrate his plans. He wanted Hermione at his side, and for that to happen, he would need to have good reason for his actions. </p><p>Muggleborns presented a danger to the statute of secrecy, but if the statute itself were done away with? Muggleborns would no longer be an issue. But to wage war on the entirety of the muggle world should the statute fall? That was a daunting task. </p><p>Hermione had caused Tom to look at the muggle world in a somewhat different light of late. She had uprooted his hatred of muggles and brought it into question. He hadn’t truthfully given much thought to it, but he was beginning to realize that his preconceptions of muggles had been partly based in his own personal hatred of the muggles he’d been raised around, as well as his disdain for his father. His time spent around his Slytherin comrades had instilled a deep dislike for non-magic people. If the oldest and wealthiest magical families despised them, they couldn’t be far off base, could they? Tom could admit that he’d been a bit impressionable coming into Hogwarts as a poor orphan who possessed no prior knowledge of the magical world he’d been suddenly thrust into. When Tom discovered his magic, he had felt as though he’d died and gone to heaven. His life suddenly burst into technicolor when it had always been colorless and drab. He had wanted to be someone important. Hearing the slurs and insults thrown at muggles and muggleborns by his Slytherin friends had penetrated the muggle side of him, causing him to want to repress that part of himself. Truly, he had never had a reason to question the inferiority of muggles. He’d never known a muggle he thought highly of. Tom had cleaved to his magical lineage, searching voraciously for knowledge about his bloodline, until he discovered his ancestral link to Salazar Slytherin himself. He’d felt wildly validated by that discovery.</p><p>Tom suddenly saw the vanity of it all. When he looked at Hermione, he realized she had absolutely no magical roots to cling to. She was an anomaly. She had been much the same as Tom; ignorant of his magic for most of his childhood. He thought of the photo he’d seen of Hermione holding her Hogwarts letter. She looked so joyous and proud. Tom knew how it felt.</p><p>Over the past few months as they’d sparred in vigorous debates about the world of muggles versus magical society, she had made great points about the potential of a world where muggles and wizards could collaborate. It all sounded quite flowery and utopian to Tom, but he doubted it was a realistic vision. But then, were his own goals realistic? He was starting to wonder.</p><p>He shook away the thoughts. He would have to think about it at a later date. </p><p>His thoughts turned to his death eaters. They had never been anything but loyal to him, but it seemed that Hermione’s presence in his life was disrupting the stability of that fealty. He would have to take care of that little issue.</p><p>He would gather them this week and retrieve their memories. All of them. Then, he’d brewed a vial of veritaserum specifically for their benefit. He would discover once and for all where their loyalties lay. </p><p>Then, there was something much more pressing that grated at his nerves, and he decided it was high time to address it. </p><p>Hermione’s potion addiction.</p><p>He flicked his eyes at the bedroom door as he sat drinking his coffee. He knew that this confrontation would go one of two ways, but he had prepared for either.</p><p>Tom sat down at Hermione’s desk in the far corner of the sitting room and penned a letter to her work, requesting the week off and instructing her assistant to reschedule any interviews or appointments she had set. He walked out onto the terrace and sent it off with Hermione’s owl.</p><p>Tom wondered where her Phoenix was. Perhaps Dumbledore had taken it. </p><p>That was another thing he couldn’t figure out. If Hermione was born of muggle parents, why was Dumbledore pretending she was his daughter? Tom’s eyes narrowed as his brain meticulously sifted through every possibility and outcome as if the future were a maze that he could memorize or a rubik’s cube that he could solve. He coveted Hermione’s memories. He ground his teeth in frustration, the gaps in his knowledge rendering him in a state of near neurosis. </p><p>He wanted to know her last name. Where had she grown up? And most importantly… how had his <em> tempaestus </em> come into <em> her </em>possession?</p><p>He lit a cigarette and let himself sink deeper into his thoughts as he waited for Hermione to wake up.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Gaspard sat back in his seat and threw his feet up onto his desk. He took one of the reports from the stack in front of him. He had a mountain of them to read, but he hadn’t been able to focus on the words on the paper all morning. </p><p>His thoughts wandered to Hermione. Gaspard had been successful in keeping his focus on work recently, despite his attraction to Dumbledore’s daughter, but since last night he’d become terribly distracted.</p><p>He supposed it was proximity that made the difference. Having the pretty young witch on his arm last night had done quite a number on him. He’d never been so honed in on the smallest details about a witch before, but he found his focus was razor sharp when picking up on the finer points of her appearance. He recalled with pinpoint accuracy the slender column of her throat, the sweetness of her perfume which overcame his senses at intervals throughout the night, the feeling of her slender hand, so small in his, and the heat that flooded his body as her warm brown eyes met his blue ones. </p><p>He had expected his interactions with the witch to be awkward and stilted, but they had been surprisingly at ease with one another in that setting. Hermione was much more congenial when her story wasn’t on the line; Gaspard smiled to himself as he realized that they had that in common. They were both relentlessly dedicated to their work. He admired her for that.</p><p>He finally admitted to himself that he was attracted to the girl, though he was somewhat disconcerted by the age difference between them. It struck him as odd that he should be intrigued by her, when there were several witches around her age currently interning in his department. They honestly irritated the hell out of him. How was it possible that Hermione was the same age as they were? He still couldn’t wrap his head around it.</p><p>For that reason, and a few others, Gaspard had kept his distance. Dumbledore had asked Gaspard to keep an eye on her, and he thought it unwise to pursue a romantic interest in his close friend’s daughter. It didn’t quite set right with him. Not only that, but as he’d danced with another of his co-workers that night, he’d caught a glimpse of Hermione chatting with a certain gentleman in the far corner of the ballroom. He was tall and dark-haired, much like Dufresne, and as he watched, the younger man had pressed her into the wall and it appeared that they were having a somewhat intimate discussion. </p><p>Gaspard wanted to know who the young man was, but he regretted asking Hermione. Her reaction had told him everything he needed to know.</p><p>Thus, Gaspard kept his demeanor cool and aloof. He didn’t need distractions, especially one in the form of a passionate young witch who would more than likely cause him nothing but trouble. His life primarily consisted of work, and it had been that way for the better part of ten years. He was quite comfortable in his present reality and decided he didn’t need another witch to have to worry about constantly. Especially one who was so recklessly determined to put herself in harm’s way.</p><p>There was a knock on his office door, and one of the interns poked her head in. It was his least favorite of them all, Peoria Parkinson. She poked her head in with a seductive smile. “Good morning, Mr. Dufresne.”</p><p>Gaspard looked up at her with a blank stare, his ghostly blue eyes cold and unreactive. “Yes, Mrs. Parkinson, what is it?”</p><p>She bit her lip and answered, “Minister Tuft has requested a short meeting with you in her office at your earliest convenience.”</p><p>Gaspard gave a curt nod. “Thank you.”</p><p>The young witch lingered. </p><p>He waited a moment, then looked up with brows lifted. His lips barely parted. “Yes?”</p><p>She looked him up and down somewhat nervously, then asked, “What were you thinking of doing for lunch?”</p><p>His eyes narrowed slightly, and he blinked. “It’s only 9 am, Mrs. Parkinson.”</p><p>“Right,” she smiled shyly. “But I just thought that… maybe-”</p><p>“I’m going to meet with the Minister now. You’d best get back to sorting contraband from last night’s raid. Be sure to get those dark arts pamphlets to the owlery by one o’ clock.”</p><p>Her face fell, but she nodded and began to back away. “Yes, sir.”</p><p>He waited until she closed the door, then pinched the bridge of his nose in irritation. He sighed and stood, then made his way out of the office, locking it behind him. He emerged to a chorus of “Good morning, Mr. Dufresne!” as he walked amongst the cubicles of the auror department, then entered the elevator, pressing the button that would take him down to Level One. </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>“Good morning, Gaspard,” crooned Wilhelmina Tuft in a warm cadence. “Do have a seat, will you?”</p><p>Gaspard stood just within the door of the Minister’s office, his hands tucked into the pockets of his robes. He glanced at her from beneath furrowed brows before he crossed the room and took a seat in the plush chair in front of her desk. He settled in and threw an arm over the back of the chair, taking a relaxed stance as he eyed her curiously. </p><p>“I trust you are having a pleasant day so far, Mr. Dufresne?”</p><p>“Pleasant enough,” he replied shortly. “What can I do for you, Minister?”</p><p>“Would you like some tea?”</p><p>“No,” he breathed. “Thank you.”</p><p>She smiled congenially. With a flick of her wand, she sent a little memo, folding like a paper bird, whizzing out of the room.</p><p>“Well,” she began in a sing-song voice, “First and foremost, I have here a stack of files detailing the new hopefuls from Hogwarts. Fresh graduates; you may want to familiarize yourself with these as I’m sure many of their applications will begin to find their way to your desk soon.” She handed him a handful of files.</p><p>Gaspard inclined his head, but made no comment as he took the folders from her hand.</p><p>“In addition, I’ve been taking a look at many of the changes and… improvements that you’ve made in the DMLE over the past few years. You do have many muggleborn aurors, don’t you?”</p><p>His eyes narrowed somewhat. “Yes, we do. Although I don’t see how that’s relevant.”</p><p>Her lips spread into a fetching smile. “Perfect. We should be striving for diversity and inclusion in all our departments, of course. However, we do want to ensure that there is <em> balance </em>as well. There is currently a scroll containing a list of potential new hires for the DMLE. Officers, as well as aurors. There should be at least three chosen from the list.”</p><p>Gaspard was silent for a moment. Then, he spoke. “You’re telling me who I can hire?”</p><p>She paused for a moment, her eyes searching his face. “Not at all, Mr. Dufresne. I have simply consulted with my cabinet and we thought it wise to have equal representation in each department.”</p><p>“Equal representation of what?”</p><p>She smiled. “Blood, of course. Purebloods should feel just as represented in our government as muggleborns, and vice versa.”</p><p>Gaspard ran his hand over his face. “Shouldn’t we be striving to eliminate the differentiation of blood statuses in our society?”</p><p>“Of course, Mr. Dufresne. However, I do think that will take some time. In the meantime, we must make each class comfortable. Don’t you agree?”</p><p>Gaspard’s eyes wandered around her office. There were photos of her husband and son. Plaques and framed achievements. Thestral breeding paraphernalia. Flowers. None of it seemed to reflect the true nature of the woman who sat before him. Gaspard couldn’t put a finger on it, but something about the woman seemed to emanate a terribly curated false persona. “Is that all you needed from me?”</p><p>She rubbed her lips together, then flicked her wand and the door to her office opened. Her assistant, a handsome young wizard, walked into the room, bearing another folder which he handed to Gaspard.</p><p>Gaspard took it, then glanced at Wilhelmina. She smiled warmly to her assistant, and gestured that he should leave them. “Thank you, Efren.”</p><p>The young man bowed low and backed out of the room, shutting the door behind him.</p><p>“I need you to do something… confidential, for me. I don’t feel comfortable asking just <em> any </em>officer at the DMLE, you see. I need you to take a look at the file I’ve given you. I need you to follow this individual, and report back to me what you see.”</p><p>Gaspard’s eyebrows drew forward sharply, and he flipped open the file. There, on the first page of the file, was a photo of the young man he’d seen speaking with Hermione at the banquet. The name at the top of the file read: Riddle, Tom Marvolo.</p><p> </p><p>
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/fqbPtVm/B8218-C6-D-36-A7-4044-95-AA-845-B6-E463212.png" alt />
</p><p> </p><p>His eyebrow lifted sharply. He’d heard the name Riddle. Quite often, in fact. Even stranger still, this young man was supposedly a political protegè of Tuft herself. He looked back at the Minister.</p><p>“Tom Riddle?”</p><p>She nodded, her eyes wary. “Do you know him, Gaspard?”</p><p>“No. I’ve heard the name.”</p><p>She gave a tight smile. “I’m sure you have. He’s quite tightly linked with many of the older wizarding families. A young friend of mine whom I believe will be a figure to watch. I’ve taken an interest in his career, as you likely have already heard. But as you can see from his file, one or two of your aurors have suspected him of potentially illicit activity and I need to know that his background is clean. I want him watched. I need to know his comings and goings. Particularly who he is spending his time with.”</p><p>Gaspard’s eyes narrowed. “He looks like a boy scout to me.”</p><p>She looked confused. “Boy Scout?”</p><p>He waved his hand dismissively. “Nevermind. It’s a muggle phrase.” He exhaled impatiently. “Not to be difficult, Minister, but I have an entire department to run. I have raids to conduct. I have ongoing investigations. I have meetings with the confederation. I’m cooperating with international ministries to hunt dangerous criminals. I have aurors to train. This is a job for a private investigator, not the head of the DMLE. You’re barking up the wrong tree.”</p><p>Her eyes betrayed her surprise, but she smiled nonetheless. “I do understand that you’re busy, Gaspard. I’m quite impressed by all that you’ve managed to accomplish. I understand that you were asked to run for Minister, but you rejected the position?”</p><p>Gaspard stared at her stonily. “That’s right.”</p><p>“Well,” she murmured musically. “Please consider this a personal favor to me. I would be more than happy to return the favor at any point in time. You have only to ask. And please… if there is an auror that you trust implicitly, do feel free to enlist their help with this charge. Report back to me with <em> anything </em> that you discover.”</p><p>Gaspard took a deep breath, being careful not to betray his immense irritation. “Very well, Mrs. Tuft. Pardon me- <em>Minister</em> Tuft. I will do my best.”</p><p>She lit up like a Christmas tree, clapping her hands together. “Thank you, sincerely, Mr. Dufresne. I am forever in your debt.”</p><p>Gaspard nodded, and then stood to go.</p><p>“By the way, Gaspard. I meant to say so earlier…” she murmured with a twinkle in her eye. “You and Miss Dumbledore made a handsome pair at the Banquet last night. Can we expect to see the two of you together more often?” Her smile appeared coy and harmless, but he felt there was something sinister about it. </p><p>“Albus and I are good friends. I’m friendly with his daughter… nothing more.”</p><p>“I see,” she muttered demurely, letting her lashes fall as if in disappointment. Gaspard intuitively decided that it was an act. “You seemed to cooperate quite well together. I noticed her article about the breach was exhaustive. You were quoted more than once.”</p><p>Gaspard’s jaw tensed, but he said nothing.</p><p>“She would make a great auror, no? Perhaps you could convince her to leave that silly job at The Prophet,” she laughed.</p><p>Gaspard stared at her. “Perhaps.”</p><p>He waved the folders. “Have a good day, Mrs. Tuft.”</p><p>She smiled. “Minister. And you as well, Mr. Dufresne..”</p><p>He gave her an amused smirk. “Right.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Hermione woke and her bed was empty. She was used to that; Tom always woke before she did. Whenever he stayed at her flat, she usually found him smoking on her terrace or pouring over her books with a cup of coffee in hand. </p><p>She never drank coffee but she kept it stocked since he was so fond of it. She found it hilarious the things that Tom splurged on. His flat was very bare. He wasn’t concerned with decorations or materialistic things. Rather, he was very attuned to the quality of certain items. Like his coffee. He spent good money on a special brand of Turkish coffee, because he said that one cup of it was equal to three cups of a cheaper brand. Hermione thought it tasted like mud, but she wasn’t going to argue. He also bought expensive, tailor-made Italian shirts. He said they lasted longer and he liked the way the fabric felt on his skin. Hermione told him that he was a very quirky wizard, indeed. He also wore silver cufflinks etched with little serpents, and costly cologne imported from Spain. These were the few things he had spent money on, and they were the handful of things he kept in his possession. Everything else seemed to fade from his consciousness, as if nothing else were important or even existed in his world. </p><p>Hermione realized suddenly that she was like one of those possessions to him. She was someone that he had decided was important and brought value to him, so he desired to hoard her like he did the rest of his costly possessions. To Tom, she was one of the few people who existed. She might even be the <em> only </em> person who mattered to Tom. Did Hermione want to be a possession to Tom? She wasn’t sure if he was capable of looking at her any other way. Tom had grown up without the concept of love and healthy relationships. As an orphan, he had only known control and manipulation and <em> lack </em>.</p><p>Perhaps he didn’t know any other way. Hermione wasn’t sure if she would be able to show him.</p><p>She got out of bed and threw on a short, silky white robe that she found thrown over her chair in front of the fireplace. It was quite nippy outside, but it stayed warm and cozy in her flat. </p><p>She walked down the hall and into the sitting room to find Riddle sitting in front of the fireplace with a book in hand and a cup of coffee on the table next to him, just as she had imagined. He wore only his trousers, his chest bare and shirtless, and it was then that Hermione noticed something she hadn’t the previous night.</p><p>She crossed the room, and he lowered his book as she approached.</p><p>“Good morning, Mrs. Riddle,” he said with a devilish smirk. </p><p>She gave him a look of horror. “Do not start with me before I’ve had my tea,” she retorted with disgust.</p><p>He allowed his eyes to rake over her attire as a slow grin spread across his face, his cheeks creasing in such a devastating way that Hermione's stomach turned flips. “It’s your fault for coming out here dressed in that rather <em> bridal </em>robe this morning. Makes me want to get it dirty.”</p><p>She glanced down and her cheeks reddened as she noticed the silky white robe for the first time. She had the urge to rip it off, except she was wearing nothing else beneath it. “Don’t distract me, Tom. What <em>is </em>that on your chest?”</p><p>She directed his attention to the new set of markings etched across his chest. On one pectoral, just above his breastbone, there was a large, red ancient rune. It didn’t look like a tattoo, nor a burn, but something in between. On the other side of his chest was another rune, burned into his skin in black ink. </p><p>“I don’t recognize those runes, Tom. Where did that come from?”</p><p>He bit the inside of his cheek. “They appeared the morning after Riddle House. I imagine it happened as a result of the ritual I performed.” He flicked his eyes at her. “I don’t know these runes either. They’re very archaic. I’m still researching them.”</p><p>Hermione swallowed, her eyes tracing over the markings. They weren’t burns, nor anything like muggle ink, but they were <em>magical</em> tattoos. As she watched them, they almost seemed to move, and it made her dizzy. The sight of them injected her heart with dread.</p><p>He stood and started toward the kitchen. “I’ve only just put a kettle on. I’ll bring you a cuppa.”</p><p>“Oh,” she breathed, feeling somewhat tired from the long day before. “That sounds perfect.”</p><p>Tom left for several minutes, and then returned to hand her a cup of tea.</p><p>As he took a seat nearby, she suddenly blushed as she realized she’d been staring at his chest for far too long, and not because of the runes. Though he was as fit as ever, she noticed that he looked a bit thinner than he had when she’d seen him last. </p><p>“Have you been eating?” she asked, concern threaded in her tone.</p><p>He cocked his head as he took a sip of coffee. “Why do you fixate on my eating habits?”</p><p>She took a sip of tea. “Because you look thin, Tom.”</p><p>He looked at her and blinked twice, before setting his coffee down on the side table. The fireplace crackled. “I suppose I just… don’t always think about it. At times, there wasn’t much to eat when I was growing up. Sometimes I went a few days without eating anything.” His brows furrowed as if he were deep in thought. “I suppose I may have… trained myself not to think about food. If I simply forgot that I was supposed to eat, then I wouldn’t be regularly reminded how long it had been since I had.”</p><p>Hermione was silent. Once again, she was overcome with the burning desire to visit the orphanage where he’d grown up. Her curiosity was insistent. Partly, she hoped that these terrible things he had experienced growing up weren’t still happening at that establishment. Hermione wondered if Tom would ever want to do something to help other orphans like himself. Had he ever thought of something like that before?</p><p>“I’m sorry, Tom,” she murmured softly, somewhat ashamed. “I didn’t mean to shine a spotlight on it.”</p><p>He shrugged. “It’s not so tragic, Hermione. I never knew anything different.”</p><p>”Well,” she muttered, casting a surreptitious side eye his direction.  “It certainly doesn’t seem to have affected your… development.” She cleared her throat.</p><p>He was drinking coffee, but paused mid-sip. His lips stretched into a grin. “What are you saying, Dumbledore?”</p><p>She looked at him, feigning surprise. “Nothing. Just that… you don’t look… stunted, I suppose.”</p><p>Tom fought back a smile as he ran his tongue over his top teeth. “Hermione… are you trying to say you think I’m fit?”</p><p>”No!” she denied quickly. She glanced at him. “Anyway… you shouldn’t have had to grow up that way.”</p><p>”So… you <em>don’t</em> think I’m fit?”</p><p>”<em>Merlin</em>,” she sighed, exasperated. “Yes, I find you annoyingly fit. I was just trying to tell you that… I’m sorry. About your childhood.”</p><p>He leaned his head back and ran a hand over his face, a clear sign that he was unwilling to continue the discussion. “And what about you, little witch? It is quite apparent now that you weren’t raised by a witch in Edinburgh, nor are you Dumbledore’s daughter. So how <em> did </em>you grow up then?”</p><p>She stared at him warily, unsure of whether she was ready to have this discussion. He had stated that he wasn’t bothered by her muggle upbringing, but she couldn’t get it out of her head how he’d hunted down muggleborns during the war. She didn't understand how his ideology could have changed so dramatically. Had the Voldemort she knew merely been a shadow of the Tom who sat beside her now? Had Voldemort delved too deeply into the dark arts? Had he split his soul so many times that he went completely insane? There were simply no answers for her.</p><p>He stared back at her expectantly.</p><p>She bit her lip. “I was raised by muggles. My parents. As I’m sure you’ve already surmised.”</p><p>He nodded. “In the 1980s, then?”</p><p>Her eyebrows shot up. “What?”</p><p>He pointed to the book he’d been reading. “Your books. This one has a publication date of 1987.”</p><p>Her mouth fell open and she looked at her hands. “Oh. Yes. Well… 1998, actually, was the year I left.”</p><p>His eyebrows lifted, and he looked at her thoughtfully. “Wow. Alright.”</p><p>She sipped her tea quietly as she let him process the information in silence. She could see his gears turning. She knew that the lack of information was eating him alive. It was only natural for someone of his ambition to want to know how his future plans had turned out. But he was respectful of her request for time.</p><p>His adam’s apple dipped as he swallowed. Then he pressed his tongue into his cheek. “I suppose that’s enough questions for today.”</p><p>He stood and crossed the room, then walked into the foyer and approached the front door of her flat. With a few flourishes of his wand, he locked the door and began to cast several complex spells and enchantments.</p><p>She followed him and watched curiously for a moment, enjoying the sight of him performing magic, his sinister-looking wand dwarfed by his long-fingered hands, waving it with deadly precision like a surgeon wielding a scalpel. “What are you doing, Tom?”</p><p>He didn’t answer her, but continued to flick his wand as she stood in silence watching.</p><p>When he finished, he turned back to find her gazing at him with sharply furrowed brows and a confused expression. </p><p>“Hermione, how long have you been using Elixir of Euphoria?”</p><p>Hermione’s eyes widened and she froze. “I- how did you know-“</p><p>“I’ve known for months. How long?”</p><p>She swallowed, then shrugged. “I don’t know. A while.”</p><p>“How often do you take it?”</p><p>Her lips parted. “What is this, Tom?”</p><p>He stared at her. “Answer me, Hermione.”</p><p>“It’s none of your business.”</p><p>He took several steps forward until he was standing before her. “It is my business when I come to your flat one night to find you practically comatose.”</p><p>Her mouth fell open. “<em> What </em>?”</p><p>“You fucking overdosed, Hermione. I don’t expect you to remember. You weren’t exactly coherent at the time.”</p><p>Hermione blinked several times, her heart racing. “When was this?”</p><p>“Last Sunday night.”</p><p>Her brows knitted as she rifled through her memory. “I thought I was dreaming.”</p><p>Tom’s jaw tensed. “How often do you take it? I need to know this.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“Because I need to know how bad the withdrawals are going to be. You have to get off of it. Starting now.”</p><p>Hermione’s eyes widened and her mouth fell open. “Excuse me?”</p><p>Tom reached out and gripped her shoulders. “It’s not a negotiation. I’ve owled your work. You won’t be going in this week. And neither will I.”</p><p>Hermione swallowed, her heart racing rapidly. “Wh- what do you know about potion withdrawals? It could be dangerous.”</p><p>He took a step closer, releasing her shoulders as he reached up to cup her chin. “I’ve done my homework. I have a healer on standby. I’m going to stay here with you and you’re getting off of it. End of story.” His eyes flickered down over her and then rose back to lock with hers. “Did you know that most people who take Elixir of Euphoria longer than a year end up dead? It’s a pretty grim number, Hermione.”</p><p>She shook her head, tears beginning to flood her eyes. “I’ve been hoping to stop taking it, Tom. I’ve just been so busy writing and I haven’t had a chance to stop and- I just…”</p><p>Her words trailed off as she choked up, overcome by mild hysteria. “I’m so embarrassed. I don't even know how it happened… before I knew it, I couldn’t stop taking them.”</p><p>Tom gazed at her searchingly. “Why did you start taking it, Hermione? What is this guilt you’re battling?”</p><p>Her eyes widened and flicked to his. “Guilt? How do you know what I’m feeling?”</p><p>Tom leaned over her until their lips were almost touching. “I can feel you, Hermione. You know it and I know it. Our souls are connected.”</p><p>Hermione’s lips parted as her eyes roamed his face. She swallowed nervously. “What makes you think that?”</p><p>Their eyes locked for several moments. “Just tell me how often you take it,” he muttered. “How many times a day?”</p><p>Hermione’s heart beat frantically. “Um… three. Sometimes… four or five.”</p><p>Tom’s jaw muscles flexed, but his expression was unreadable. “You have to get off of it, Hermione. You know that, don’t you?”</p><p>Hermione blinked at the tears and nodded as they trailed in wet rivulets down her cheeks. Tom reached up and wiped at them with his thumbs. “Will you let me help you? Do you trust me? At least in this?”</p><p>Hermione swallowed, then nodded in silence. How strange she found it, to be this vulnerable with her greatest enemy. That he should even care about her well-being was an immense shock to Hermione’s psyche.</p><p>“I’ll go ahead and warn you, Hermione. It’s not going to be pleasant. But I will stay and see you through it.”</p><p>“I-” Hermione began, her anxiety rising. “I’m supposed to interview Wilhelmina Tuft this week.”</p><p>Tom shook his head. “It’s been rescheduled.”</p><p>“Oh,” she breathed shakily. She looked back up at him hesitantly. “Why would you want to help me, Tom? All I’ve done is fight you.”</p><p>He gazed at her blankly for several seconds, his expression a mask. After a beat, he muttered acidly, “I know you’re not this fucking stupid, little witch.” He shook his head and sighed, then turned to leave the foyer. “Come. We are getting rid of every single vial of that <em>bloody</em> elixir you have on hand.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>Hermione woke at 2am in a pool of sweat. Her arms and legs were jumping and her heart rate was through the roof. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She sat up, unable to breathe. She sucked in air but her vision seemed to be spinning. Dizziness overcame her; her very muscles seemed to be constricting. The cords in her throat bulged as she attempted to suck in a breath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In a moment, Tom was awake. She felt his cool hands on her face. “Hermione, are you okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I- I can’t breathe,” she choked out. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom stood and left the room. A few minutes later he returned with a glass of some kind of mixture which he’d been informed by the St. Mungo’s nurse would help to combat the withdrawal symptoms. It was a cocktail consisting of a few muggle drugs and supplements, mixed with several potions ingredients and a calming draught. He brought it to Hermione and watched as she sipped it slowly. He’d been informed by the nurses that she would likely not need to be admitted, but it was always a possibility if her symptoms became too severe.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione refused to go to the hospital. She was too afraid Dumbledore might find out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom lifted her soaked nightgown over her head and replaced it with one of his fancy Italian shirts, simply because he knew that she preferred them. Then he instructed her to lay at his side. As soon as she did, he began to massage her jerking limbs. Her body had become chilled, tense, and racked with shakes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Y-you don’t h-have to do this, Tom.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Relax, little witch,” he muttered as his adept fingers kneaded her taut muscles. “I’m forcing you to do it. It’s the least I can do.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She shook her head. “Y-you’re not f-forcing me.  I n-need to do it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just relax, Hermione. Give the draught time to work. Try to get some sleep.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>After another half hour, her symptoms were slightly better, but sleep still evaded her. So Tom dosed her with Dreamless Sleep potion, and watched her drift off into the ether.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He stroked her skin long after she’d fallen asleep, his eyes tracing the scars on her body. He was responsible for those, but he wondered to himself how many emotional scars he was also responsible for inflicting on her soul. He didn’t say as much to Hermione, but he felt somehow at fault for her potion addiction, although he wasn’t sure precisely why.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He gazed at her as she slept, wishing that he could dive magically into her dreams and perhaps, catch a glimpse of the life she’d left behind. He wanted to know </span>
<em>
<span>that</span>
</em>
<span> Hermione, to experience the world that had molded her into the formidable witch that she was. He felt as though there was an entire world between them while she held her memories back from him. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Who was his witch really, and what kind of world had she come from?</span>
</p><p>
<span>In 1998, Tom would be seventy-two years old. His brows furrowed slightly as he tried to imagine the reality of the world he hoped to create. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom had created his Tempaestus to help him alter the future should he fail in his quest for power, but had he somehow unwittingly brought his soulmate here instead? Was this what the fates had woven into his loom?</span>
</p><p>
<span>These thoughts troubled Tom.</span>
</p><p>
<span>His life had always been a singular path, his goals and dreams clear and easily defined.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Ever since Hermione had entered his life, his future seemed ambiguous and unsure.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He desperately wanted to know where his path would lead. What had become of him in the future? Why did Hermione fear to tell him?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Surely, the information would only aid their journey forward, by giving Tom valuable foresight.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Their</span>
</em>
<span> journey. He’d never thought of it quite like that, but as soon as it entered his mind, he knew there was no way forward for him without her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He stared at her as she lay at his side. He thought of her scars. Tom would never let anything so traumatizing happen to her ever again. The people she’d been close to in her previous life didn’t matter; they clearly hadn’t made Hermione a priority, or they wouldn’t have allowed her to be tortured in such a way. Tom would be better for her than anyone ever had been, because he was powerful enough to ensure her protection.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He decided he would burn the entire fucking world to keep her safe. The thought entered his mind coldly and savagely, without pomp or dramatics. It was a silent, solemn vow, a thick chain snaked around his heart, constricting and padlocked. Hermione alone held the key. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Murder was the </span>
<em>
<span>least </span>
</em>
<span>of the atrocities he would commit if she was in danger. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom was a cold-blooded serpent, seeing the world in gray-scale, with the one ray of color in his life being the witch by his side. He gazed at her covetously, as if she might disappear if he took his eyes off of her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom wondered if this was love. He didn’t think it matched the flowery descriptions he’d read in muggle prose, nor did it fit the poetic, Shakespearean lyricism so prevalent in the culture of muggles and wizards alike.</span>
</p><p>
<span>What he felt for Hermione was something akin to madness. A seeping, black illness that threatened to imbrue his entire being: spirit, soul, and body. The ferocity of his ache to possess, to hoard her away from the entire world made Tom question his very sanity. He was breathless with it at times.</span>
</p><p>
<span>No matter how often they slept together, it was never enough to satisfy the gnawing hunger he felt.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Was it the call of his magic to hers that made him feel this way? Was it the proximity of her soul to his, the painful ache to have their souls become one?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom fell back into the bed, his face twisted into an expression of acute torture.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He was distracted. Hermione had become the forefront of his worries and concerns. As far back as he could remember, he had always kept a mental checklist of his plans and goals for each day, each week. He tried to bring it to memory now, but his thoughts were blank. He gritted his teeth and turned over in frustration.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He lay his arm across his witch in silent supremacy and closed his eyes as he attempted to sleep.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>Hermione woke up suddenly, ran to the loo, and proceeded to vomit violently. She spent the better part of the morning dry heaving, her body vacillating between severe chills and shakes, and a fever, sweats, and an increased heart rate. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom was very attentive, even nurturing, which shocked Hermione. She thought to herself that he could’ve been a healer with his level of patience and attention to detail.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she had chills, she laid on the sofa, reclining against his chest as she wrapped up in a blanket, shivering. When she inevitably threw up whatever she’d just eaten, he held her hair back and brought her water. He kept a constant vigil over her, which Hermione was both grateful for and disconcerted by. His attentiveness made her uncomfortable. Not even Ron or Harry had ever been this vigilant when she’d been wounded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The third day was the worst. Hermione had no energy, and she’d lost her magic.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It will come back, Hermione,” Riddle assured her. “Potion withdrawals are especially brutal, because it’s not just a physical dependency, but a magical one. Your magic won’t function properly until the effects wear off.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione began to hallucinate. The nurse had informed him that her hallucinations could last for up to two days. Tom sat beside her, a cool cloth laid across her forehead to keep her temperature down. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She spoke nonsense. She had conversations with people who didn’t exist; at least, not in this world. She called for Harry, for Ginny; she screamed for someone named Fred. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t let Bellatrix find you,” she whispered. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I won’t, Hermione,” Tom replied. He always spoke back, because if he didn’t, her hallucinations seemed to get worse.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She whispered things that piqued Tom’s curiosity. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“He was at Hogwarts. He killed Harry, but Harry wasn’t dead. I can still see him... His eyes were red.” She looked at Tom, but her gaze was faraway. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She kept addressing him by the name Ron.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom’s brows furrowed. “Who killed him?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He Who Must Not Be Named.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom cocked his head. After a moment, he murmured, “Do you mean Voldemort?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t say his name, Ron,” she breathed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom’s breath caught. “Why not?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Because he can find us. If you say his name, he will know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom’s blood grew cold. He’d often studied trace magic with the sole purpose of discovering whether a trace could be put upon certain words. He’d thought of utilizing it somehow, in case he wasn’t successful in his creation of the dark mark. What she described sounded an awful lot like the tracing spell he’d been researching in recent weeks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom was suddenly afraid of what her memories would reveal.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom swallowed. “What else happened at Hogwarts, Hermione?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her eyelids fell shut, lashes resting on her cheeks as she breathed deeply. “So many of the Order died. But we killed him.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom froze. “You killed who?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know who, Ron. He-who-must-not-be-named.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom sat, still as a statue. He blinked several times, unable to process what he’d heard.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It dawned on him with all the dread of a sunset in a graveyard.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was </span>
<em>
<span>him</span>
</em>
<span>. The dark wizard she’d killed, with the help of two of her friends.</span>
</p><p>
<span>No wonder she had been reluctant to reveal her memories to him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom’s blood rushed and his ears rang. He could feel the violent pounding of his heart in his chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He stood slowly and walked into the kitchen. Resting his hands on the counter, he bowed his head low. His fears were confirmed. He had been permeated for months by the sneaking suspicion that Hermione wanted to kill him. She </span>
<em>
<span>surely </span>
</em>
<span>knew about his horcruxes. Otherwise, it would be impossible to kill him. </span>
<em>
<span>Unless… </span>
</em>
<span>they defeated his physical body without being aware of the horcruxes. If that were the case, his soul could potentially still be wandering the earth in the future.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom ran a cloth under cool water and then folded it, but his hands shook with a slight tremor.</span>
</p><p>
<span>If his witch had thought it necessary to kill him in the future, then why hadn’t she attempted to strike preemptively and kill him now? Why hadn’t she tried? </span>
</p><p>
<span>Realization hit Tom like a tidal wave.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fucking hell,” he muttered, shaking his head in disbelief. He couldn’t believe how thick he’d been.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was suddenly all too obvious where her guilt was stemming from: her failure to kill him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>If he was her enemy then… she had essentially thrown her ethics to the wind in favor of their burgeoning relationship. He must’ve been incredibly dense not to have realized it sooner.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom took a deep breath. </span>
</p><p>
<span>That must mean that she cared for him just as much as he cared for her. Why else would she risk it all for someone she feared so deeply?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom took several moments to clear his head and calm his body. He didn’t want to reveal what he knew, nor inform her of the things she’d said while hallucinating. He decided to let the information simmer in his mind for a few days.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>By Thursday, her hallucinations were beginning to fade and she was somewhat functional again. Her magic hadn’t fully returned, and her body was weak, but she was cognizant enough to sit with him and drink tea in the morning. Tom thought it was a good sign that she’d requested the morning issue of </span>
<em>
<span>The Daily Prophet</span>
</em>
<span>. He’d taken her post from the owl early that morning, so he handed her the copies of her morning papers as she sipped her tea.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you have anywhere you should be, Tom? I feel terrible, pulling you away from your responsibilities.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He glanced up from his book. “No, love. I’ve effectively disappeared for the week. Although, I probably will check my post in a bit. I won’t be gone long.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Take your time,” she murmured. She picked up a copy of Rumours! and began scanning the paper out of boredom. She shook her head at the ill-informed trash columns detailing the current murder trial of the Black Widow of Wiltshire. A beautiful young witch named Alma Kenelwirst, only twenty-four years of age, was currently on trial before the Wizengamot for the murder of her three late husbands. According to the reports, she had poisoned one, imperiused another to strangle himself, and the third, she lured into a lake infested with Kelpies and watched as he was dragged beneath the water and eaten. Her own famous attorney, Starling Silvanox, was representing the girl in the trial. The murders were quite grisly, but the drama-fixated papers were committed to romanticizing the murderess, as she was so young and beautiful, and had a relatively tragic backstory which caused the masses to pity her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione glanced at Tom, thinking to herself that he was also young and handsome, with a tragic backstory and a murderous bent. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As she scanned the paper, her eyes caught on a particular article in the astrology section. They were a few weeks away from entering into the sign of Capricorn, and the paper had an interesting write-up relating to the compatibility of Capricorn with other signs. Hermione didn’t quite believe in zodiac compatibility. After all, some of her best friends were signs that were supposedly incompatible with her own sign, Virgo. Harry was one of them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Still, she glanced up at Tom. </span>
<em>
<span>He</span>
</em>
<span> was a capricorn. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She was a bit curious as she hadn’t learned much about the zodiac, after all, since she dropped her Divination classes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The article listed the positive traits of Capricorn as follows: hardworking, ambitious, loyal, serious, organized, diligent, success-driven, and practical.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The negative traits were listed as the tendency to be critical, melancholy, work-obsessed, unforgiving, sensitive,and pessimistic.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione surprisingly agreed with all of them. Both the negative and positive traits fit Tom perfectly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She skipped through parts of the article until she got to the section which most drew her interest: compatible signs. She hesitantly began to scan the article.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>When it comes to romantic relationships, the Capricorn personality is an unusual combination of intensely devoted but lacking in emotion. They're a bit stiff and reserved, but that doesn't mean they can't be ideal partners.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Once you get to know a Capricorn on a deeper, more personal level, they'll likely stay committed to you for life. While it can take years to get them to fully open up emotionally, it's worth it for their loyalty, strength, and protectiveness.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Capricorns often treat their romantic relationships as they do their jobs: they believe hard work will ultimately spell out success—for themselves, their partners, and the relationship as a whole. This practical approach can sometimes make the relationship feel clinical or unnatural, but it's just the way Capricorns best express their love and how much they value the relationship.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione swallowed. She couldn’t believe she was actually attempting to understand the love language of a psychopathic, murderous dark lord. If Hermione was being honest with herself, she didn’t actually believe that Tom was capable of love. Toxic possessiveness? Yes. Savage obsession? Sure. But love? Hermione couldn’t believe it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Of course, he appeared attentive and seemingly caring now, but how long would it last? She couldn’t imagine Tom being so steadfast once their morals and goals began to truly clash.</span>
</p><p>
<span>With a sigh, she continued reading.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The signs which were listed as most compatible with Capricorn were Taurus, Virgo, Scorpio, and Pisces.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione bit her lip as she realized she was among those listed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She spared another glance at Riddle, and then continued reading, becoming engrossed in the psychological analysis of his sign. It was the first time she’d actually read this paper with anything besides total disgust.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Several minutes went by as she poured over the lengthy and detailed astrological evaluation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“…. </span>
<em>
<span>Hermione</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Suddenly, she looked up. Riddle was gazing at her with an eyebrow cocked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She looked at him with surprise. “What?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He tilted his head, eyeing her curiously. “I’ve said your name three times now. What are you reading that’s so bloody fascinating?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione’s lips parted and her cheeks instantly turned red. “Nothing.” She started to fold the paper but in the same instant, he leaned forward and snatched it from her grasp.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Excuse </span>
<em>
<span>me!</span>
</em>
<span>” she exclaimed as she tried to take it back, but he held it aloft, out of her reach. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She scowled, dropping her hands in her hands into her lap.</span>
</p><p>
<span>His eyes narrowed as they slid back and forth over the paper. After a few moments, he flicked his eyes back up at her. He seemed to be fighting back a smirk. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you that curious whether we’re compatible, little witch?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her cheeks burned hot with embarrassment. “Certainly not,” she huffed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The corners of his lips turned up in amusement. “Allow me to give you the expert opinion of this very qualified </span>
<em>
<span>Rumors </span>
</em>
<span>columnist, as we both know they are </span>
<em>
<span>very</span>
</em>
<span> competent journalists.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She glared at him, causing him to grin widely. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ahem,” he muttered, clearing his throat. “Let’s see. Virgo and Capricorn.” He glanced at her, his expression teasing and playful. “Virgo intuits Capricorn’s desire to achieve and can be their number one fan. Capricorn feels supported by Virgo's desire to serve and finds their practical advice very helpful. Capricorn's intense drive shows Virgo how to envision a master plan, encompassing all their interests. When both have hefty careers that make their days full, they can sink into a rhythm of productivity that works. Having that rhythm in place actually makes both of these signs more relaxed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“One difference here is that Virgo doesn't give a fig about status, while Capricorn eyes the top of the social heap. Capricorn is willing to work hard, but is known as a sign of delegated power. The cardinality of Capricorn gives them the drive to wrangle people and resources, that is not present in the (typical) Virgo, who is fine to have the work be its own reward. This can lead to off-balance power dynamics or lack of respect that takes a toll.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Capricorn admires self-starters and will appreciate the Virgo work ethic and resourcefulness. But the authoritative Capricorn can find it hard to relate to a Virgo who plays it small or modestly. The confidence of Capricorn is a tonic for Virgo, as long as it doesn't come with heavy judgment. Virgo already has that area covered, in the demands they put on themselves.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Both signs have high expectations for themselves in life. A demanding and bossy Capricorn can be hard on the nerves of sensitive Virgo. Capricorn benefits from being with a flexible partner, one that instinctively knows how to 'process', and purify their system. Both need solitude, though Capricorn is known to retreat into a cave of melancholy. Virgo has the wisdom to share with Capricorn about renewal and going with the flow of life.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The downside of Capricorn is they can tend to be overbearing, whereas Virgo can tend to bend over backward to please. Capricorn is demanding and rarely satisfied, a cold realist who often works themselves into exhaustion. Virgo is a sign of relentless critique, to crazymaking levels.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“However, these two signs are highly sexually compatible, and Capricorn has no problem taking the lead. </span>
<span>Capricorns are highly physical and have great stamina, coupled with a rock-solid stability and level of commitment. Sex will be explosive when these two lovers open up and become more inventive in the bedroom. Virgo’s hidden kinky side could really bring Capric-”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, now you’re just making it up to mock me!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom burst into laughter and stared at her incredulously. “I swear, I’m reading it directly off the paper, you little brat!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Please stop reading regardless, I’m mortified enough now, thank you.” Her cheeks had turned a brilliant scarlet hue.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom looked at Hermione with a heated glance and a devilish grin. He folded the paper and handed it back to her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Would you agree with this assessment, Mrs. Riddle?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione rolled her eyes. “Oh, do stop it, before you make me vomit.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He chuckled. “Do you really need a paper to tell you what you already know?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione gave him an exasperated look. “And what’s that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He smirked and stood, pulling his cigarettes from the back pocket of his trousers. He drew one out and then leaned over to deposit a kiss on her forehead. “That we’re meant to be, of course.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He didn’t wait for her response, but left her sitting at the breakfast table as he retreated to the terrace to smoke.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione’s heart beat rapidly as she gazed at him through the floor-to-ceiling windows. He cut an impressive form as he leaned over the balustrade, his pale, sculpted cheeks turning red in the biting November wind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The two of them were a study in polarity. Even her feelings for him were two extreme ends of a spectrum. She held both admiration and disgust for him. Both hate and adoration, desire and repulsion…. Both trust and crippling fear, all simultaneously.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione decided she felt well enough to cook breakfast. Tom had attempted to cook for her while she was out of commission, but his culinary skills were rather bleak. He explained that he’d hardly ever been near a kitchen in his life, what with living in between an orphanage and Hogwarts. Hermione decided she would teach him to cook, if for no other reason than self-preservation. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione sighed, and stood up to go and make breakfast.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>The following evening, she felt much better physically, but her magic was still suffering, and her mood had been up and down all day. She cried easily, and she had a tendency to snap at Tom. After one such occurrence, she apologized tearfully, but Tom waved it off, saying that it was a typical part of the withdrawal process. They laid on her velvet sofa together, curled up in front of the fire. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione had shown him her enchanted record player, which had still been in her beaded bag. She had packed it after obliviating her parents, because she had always listened to records with her father and she had wanted to bring something on the run with Ron and Harry that reminded her of her parents. Many of the albums in her record collection had belonged to her father. She had often played music during the cold nights of winter in the Forest of Dean. It seemed to alleviate some of the tension that had built from wearing the locket horcrux, especially after Ron had left.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She surprised herself by wanting to show it to Riddle. It seemed like something that would bring up terribly painful memories, but she found that it almost soothed the pain of the past to listen to the records with him now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom was surprised by the music of the future. She’d thought he would dislike it, but he shocked her by asking to listen to it every night. He was particularly fond of Nirvana, Jimi Hendrix, and Neil Young. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione resigned herself to the fact that Tom Riddle would never cease to surprise her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She reclined against his chest, laid back between his legs with his arms wrapped around her stomach. The fireplace crackled and a soft, mournful ballad by Neil Young drifted through the sitting room.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Hey, Hey, My, My… Rock and Roll will never die…</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Their hands were interlocked, and her fingers absentmindedly toyed with his black and gold Gaunt ring.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Tom?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hmm?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How did you know I was at Riddle House? I was under the invisibility cloak.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>His thumb stroked the skin of her wrist lightly. “I smelled you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione was quiet for a beat. “You’re joking.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He laughed under his breath. “No, I’m not. At first, I thought perhaps your scent was still on my clothing. But when I got closer to you, the smell got stronger. I’d know your scent anywhere.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why didn’t you uncover me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom swallowed. He was silent for a moment before he spoke. “I don’t intend to put you in any more danger than you’re already putting yourself in.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Neither of them spoke for several minutes. The fire crackled in the hearth.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>It’s better to burn out… than to fade away…</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“Where did you go?” she asked softly. “When you stepped into the basin?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom took a deep breath. “I don’t know,” he admitted truthfully. “It’s as if I was unconscious. I don’t remember a thing between stepping in and waking up on the table.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh,” she breathed. “The day after. You looked… so different. Terrifying. Do you feel different?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He nodded. “I feel stronger. Magic is easier. Particularly the dark arts. And I feel… more keen. As if I could devour ten spellbooks and absorb them all at once.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione said nothing. She didn’t like to think that he’d become even more powerful than he already was. Had he absorbed the power of Herpo the Foul in the previous timeline? He must have.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She thought of the vision he’d shown her when she penetrated his mind. He’d called her his soulmate. Hermione feared that he was right. Hadn’t the strange seer at the Leaky Cauldron said the same thing?</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was all very disturbing to Hermione. She could not accept it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She played with his ring distractedly. There it was; the resurrection stone. In her beaded bag was the cloak of invisibility, and Dumbledore possessed the elder wand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did you know,” she murmured, “that the muggles wear rings to show their relationship?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom lifted his brows and tilted his head to look down at her. “What do you mean?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione smiled. “It’s quite silly. In school, when a boy asks a girl to go steady, the boy will often give the girl his class ring and she would wear it, to show that they were a couple.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom frowned slightly. “Did a boy ever give you his ring?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course not,” she laughed. “I said </span>
<em>
<span>muggles</span>
</em>
<span>, not wizards.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why not wizards?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She shrugged. “I don’t </span>
<em>
<span>know</span>
</em>
<span>, I’m not the one to ask.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shall we start a trend, then, darling?” He let go of her hand and moved to pull his ring off. He waved a hand over it, seemingly performing some bit of wandless magic and then he gripped her hand and slid the ring onto her finger.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione froze. She gulped as she stared at the horcrux on her finger. Why was he giving her this?</span>
</p><p>
<span>It contained a piece of his </span>
<em>
<span>soul</span>
</em>
<span>, for Godric’s sake.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I-” Her heart pounded. “Why are you giving me this?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So you can </span>
<em>
<span>wear </span>
</em>
<span>it, thickhead.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione could feel the sinister traces of dark magic saturating the cold metal. ‘But, isn’t this your… ancestral ring? A family heirloom?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It is.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I couldn’t possibly wear it!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You will wear it, because I said so.” He waved his hand again, transfiguring the ring marginally so that it shrunk to fit her smaller finger.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why, Tom?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Because you’re my witch. Do you need another reason?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione chewed her bottom lip as she fought back a smile. “Does this mean we’re going steady?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“If that’s what you want it to mean,” he muttered. His breath tickled her neck.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I thought you said I wouldn’t be your girlfriend unless I told you the truth.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He snorted. “You’ve been partially truthful. Rome wasn’t built in a day. But I don’t recall saying you were my girlfriend.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I- well, no, you didn’t.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>His lips pulled into a grin. “Do you want to be?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t think it matters, Tom. It’s not as if this is… leading anywhere. Right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why wouldn’t it be?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her mouth fell open. “Well, I mean… I don’t see how it could.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom was quiet. His expression was pensive as his thumb stroked her skin gently.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you planning on ending this at some point, Hermione?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t know how to answer that. In theory, she had always envisioned it ending. Either by his death, his imprisonment, or by her leaving and never coming back. But in reality, all she wanted was to be with him like this, every night for as long as humanly possible. But at what point would he begin to transform into the monster he was destined to become? When would she finally lose Tom Riddle to the dark shadow of Voldemort? “I don’t know, Tom. I guess I haven’t thought that far ahead.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom was silent. The minutes dragged on painfully.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, he carefully lifted her away from him and stood. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m going to bed.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione heard his footsteps echoing down the hallway, and then the sound of the bedroom door closing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione stared into the fire, her chest tightening as a lump rose into her throat and threatened to choke her. Tears glistened in her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>If Tom was incapable of love or affection, then why did she feel as if she’d just daggered him in the heart?</span>
</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>“Tom?”</p><p>He lay flat in bed beside Hermione, and the moment she breathed his name, his eyes popped open. They were a glowing, scarlet red. </p><p>Hermione gasped, jumping slightly as her heart began to race.</p><p>He sat unmoving for a moment, blinking intermittently as he stared at the ceiling. After a beat, she watched his eyes slowly fade to black.</p><p>Then he turned to her.</p><p>“Are you okay, Tom?”</p><p>He gazed at her for a few seconds. “Dreams.”</p><p>His hand shot out and snatched her waist against his.</p><p>“What dreams?”</p><p>He shook his head. “It doesn’t matter.”</p><p>He was already sliding her knickers down her hips.</p><p>“Wait,” she breathed.</p><p>He stopped, pinning her with a look of irritation and impatience.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” she murmured, her eyes meeting his unabashedly. “About what I said last night.”</p><p>He swallowed. In his gaze, she saw no hurt or anger, only a kind of self-awareness and introspection that she found confusing. “It’s fine, Hermione. I suppose it does make sense.”</p><p>“I just,” Hermione began, but cut herself off as she searched for the proper words. “It’s not that I don’t want this to lead to something, but… I’ve already been through so much. I’m afraid I can’t take another great Shakespearean tragedy in my life.”</p><p>His jaw tensed. He looked at her seriously, and his cosmic black eyes were pensive and faraway. He gave a short nod of acknowledgement, then changed the subject. “I have to go. I have a meeting this morning. I can’t laze the day away with you, unfortunately.” He smirked. “Our little honeymoon is over.”</p><p>Hermione snorted and rolled her eyes. “Yes, I quite enjoyed the part where you held my hair back while I upchucked profusely. Quite romantic.”</p><p>He grinned. “Oh, I enjoyed that too. You stopped playing tough, for once.”</p><p>That elicited a smile from her and she ran her fingers absently down his planes of his chest, dragging her fingernails through the light hair on his chest. </p><p>He caught her wrist, wrapping his long, powerful fingers around her delicate bones and pinned it to her side. Then he proceeded to search the skin of her shoulder with his mouth. </p><p>“Um,” she breathed. Then she cleared her throat. “Tom.”</p><p>He ejected a violent stream of air from his nostrils as he leaned back and glared at her. </p><p>“I don’t really feel like it this morning.”</p><p>He cocked his head, eyes narrowing. “Since when?”</p><p>She bit her lip. “Since I started my period last night?”</p><p>His eyebrows shot up. “<em> Oh </em>.”</p><p>She nodded, then looked around awkwardly.</p><p>He cleared his throat. “So you… definitely <em> don’t </em>want to-“</p><p>“Tom!”</p><p>He grinned. “Just clarifying.”</p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes. “Definitely not. Now I need my tea.”</p><p>He chuckled and allowed her to roll away. As she made her way toward the bedroom door, he said, “Hermione.”</p><p>She turned with a questioning look.</p><p>“Give me your knickers.”</p><p>Her eyes widened. “Are you serious?”</p><p>He grinned deviously. “As a heart attack, little witch.”</p><p>She stared at him incredulously, but then acquiesced with a roll of her eyes as she slid them down her thighs and stepped out of them. She balled them up and threw them directly at his face. </p><p>His laughter echoed behind her as she closed the bedroom door with a smile.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Hermione saw him off with a semi-serious admonishment. “No murdering.”</p><p>He looked at her with a strange expression, one eyebrow cocked. “Is that what you think I do all day? Kill people?”</p><p>She shrugged. “Murder seems to be what you do best… especially in the future.”</p><p>He gazed at her searchingly, his eyes narrowed. He chose not to ask the questions that were incessantly grating at his mind. “Well, as much as I’d love to kill a few people this morning, I must restrain myself. I need those people.”</p><p>“Oh, I see. It’s a meeting of your Death Eaters. The Knights.”</p><p>His head snapped around. “You know about the knights?”</p><p>She shrugged and smiled sweetly as she took his cloak from the coat stand and handed it to him.</p><p>He swung it over his shoulders and fastened it. “You know a bit too much, Miss Dumbledore. Perhaps it’s you that I should kill.”</p><p>Hermione smiled sweetly and leaned forward to brush the lint from his shoulders. “Not if I kill you first.”</p><p>He didn’t smile or laugh, but he gazed at her with narrowed eyes.</p><p>She bit her lip, holding back a smile. “I’m joking, Tom.”</p><p>“Right.”</p><p>She gazed up at him as she mindlessly toyed with the Gaunt ring, turning it around and around her slim finger.. “Thank you for calling me <em> Miss Dumbledore </em> instead of Mrs. Riddle.”</p><p>He smirked. “Do you think it matters? You’re mine no matter what name you go by. Which reminds me… I would still like to know what your <em> actual </em> name is.”</p><p>She stood on her tiptoes and pecked his lips. “Have a good day, darling.”</p><p>Tom rolled his eyes. “You as well, Mrs. Riddle.”</p><p>Hermione huffed. “I don’t like that joke.”</p><p>He leaned in and kissed her forehead. “Give me another name to replace it, then.” He turned to leave. “Be a good girl while I’m gone.”</p><p>“I most certainly will not.”</p><p>“Perfect,” he chuckled as he lifted his hood over his head. “I’ll just have to punish your throat when I get back.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Tom wore all black, looking every bit like a shadowy viper, from his heavy cloak to the shine of his dragonhide boots and black leather gloves. The brilliant silver clasp of his cloak gleamed like justice, standing out in contrast against the dark collar of his shirt. </p><p>His eyes glowed crimson, swimming with the blood he would always have on his hands, never to be washed away. </p><p>The cold, December wind whipped at his face. He apparated just inside the heavy iron gate of Malfoy Manor.</p><p>He stood gazing at the hedge maze, as still as the marble statues dotting the landscape. Tom was thinking about the previous night, and trying desperately to get Hermione out of his head so that he could focus on the task at hand.</p><p>He couldn’t shake the sight of his horcrux on her finger. She’d even worn it to bed last night, despite the things she’d said to him. She had slid beneath the sheet beside him, her soft body molded to his, sliding her hand over his chest with the icy metal of his ring grazing his skin. </p><p>“I’m sorry, Tom,” she had whispered, though she’d thought he was asleep. “I do want you, even though I shouldn’t.”</p><p>But Tom hadn’t been able to sleep.</p><p>It had cut Tom deeply that Hermione might actually be considering an eventual end to their dalliance. Is that what she saw it as? A dalliance? An affair? Surely not. </p><p>Her apology this morning had served as a buffer, but it still irked Tom to no end that she’d said it.</p><p>Still, the sight of his ring on her finger stirred something in Tom. It sang to his need to claim her; soothing the ache of their uncompleted soul bond. Of course, Tom had other reasons for giving her the horcrux. He’d wondered for weeks now if she knew about his horcruxes. She’d given no indication that she did, except that she’d made a comment to him recently about “intact souls” and that itched in the back of his mind unceasingly. </p><p>
<em> “Dementors feed on intact souls and happy memories, and I’ve a feeling you have neither.” </em>
</p><p>He wanted to know if she’d really try to kill him. He was quite well aware that putting a piece of his soul in the hands of someone who could potentially want him dead was a bad call, but the witch had him so pent up that he decided he needed to know once and for all if he could trust her. The only thing that might cause him to question Hermione would be the destruction of one of his horcruxes.</p><p>His soul was a sacred boundary never to be crossed. </p><p>Tom walked calmly up the stone steps and through the immense double doors, crossing through the foyer, his shoes clicking against the cold checkered marble floors. The portraits of Malfoy's fair-haired ancestors lined the vast hallway, tracking him with their eyes as if they could sense his intent. They whispered as he passed.</p><p>He approached the entrance to the drawing room. He stood still for a beat, and then turned the handles, opening the double doors. </p><p>The talk grew hushed as he entered the room.</p><p>His Death Eaters sat at a round table, and they watched Tom make his way across the room in silence. </p><p>Abraxas stood, extending his arms in greeting. “Good morning, my Lord.”</p><p>Tom grinned at Malfoy, his red eyes glittering sinisterly. “Hello, Mr. Malfoy. A good morning it is.”</p><p>“I trust your week was pleasant?”</p><p>“Very.” Tom made his way to the table where his death eaters sat staring. He took his seat and Abraxas sat beside him. The conversations resumed, albeit more quietly than before.</p><p>Tom withdrew his cigarettes and slipped one between his lips. He struck a match and held the flame up, breathing in the tobacco deeply. </p><p>Abraxas wrinkled his nose. “Why on earth do you smoke those awful things? <em> Muggle </em>, aren’t they?”</p><p>Tom blew smoke in his face. Then his eyes flicked downward over Malfoy’s appearance. “I might as well ask <em> you </em>why you insist on wearing those hideous cravats when you know they make you look like a pretentious wanker?”</p><p>Abraxas looked down at the audacious green silk cravat tucked into his collar, and shifted in his seat self-consciously. “These are made by one of the best magical tailors in France. They’re all the rage now.”</p><p>Tom leaned forward with a smile, and lowered his voice to a whisper. “Yes, I’m sure. And did you know that those very cravats originated with the muggles? The Croatian military, specifically. A style adopted by the muggles in Paris.”</p><p>Abraxas ran his fingers over the green paisley silk, his cheeks heating as Tom smirked and inhaled smoke sharply. Tom chuckled and muttered, “I prefer not to wear anything around my neck that someone might… <em> choke </em>me with.”</p><p>Tom stood and made his way to a golden bar cart and poured himself a crystal glass of Ogden’s. </p><p>He moved back to his spot and took a seat, then brought the glass to his lips.</p><p>Abraxas cocked a brow. “Firewhiskey this early?”</p><p>Tom sipped it slowly and then smacked his lips before turning his blood red eyes on Abraxas. “There’s nothing you can say to me that will make that bloody cravat seem like less of a crime, Malfoy.”</p><p>“Noted,” said his first-in-command stonily.</p><p>“Gentleman,” Tom called out, drawing the eyes of the room. The quiet muttering ceased. “I must ask you all to stay a while. We have much to discuss.”</p><p>Suddenly, black ropes wound themselves around their arms and legs like vines, tethering their limbs to their chairs. They each cried out, fighting against the magical bonds.</p><p>“Tom, what’s the meaning of this?” shouted Avery.</p><p>Tom smiled, and then uttered something resembling a hiss; parseltongue. The ropes turned into black serpents, winding tightly around their limbs.</p><p>The men shouted, but to no avail. They couldn’t reach their wands, and there was very little use that would do if they could. They feared to ever lift their wands against Voldemort.</p><p>“Do not be alarmed, my friends. I simply have a few questions for you all. This should go smoothly… that is, <em> if </em>you’ve nothing to hide.”</p><p>Avery and Macnair stared at one another wide-eyed. Rosier and Lestrange wisely sat still. Dolohov thrashed at the serpents, shaking his chair, but they only tightened the more he struggled, winding themselves into a crushing hold that threatened his circulation. </p><p>He still hadn’t recovered from Tom’s previous use of the cruciatus.</p><p>Tom conjured a goblet out of the air. The green glass goblet filled itself with a dark wine. From his robes he produced a vial of potion, which he then emptied into the goblet. Then, with a flick of his wand, he floated the goblet to Abraxas’ mouth. </p><p>“Drink,” he commanded.</p><p>Abraxas’ eyes were wide. “What is this, Tom?” </p><p>Tom hovered the goblet closer, so that the rim pushed against Malfoy’s lips. “<em> Drink </em>,” he gritted.</p><p>Abraxas heaved deep breaths, but his lips parted and the goblet tipped forward to pour the maroon wine over his tongue. </p><p>Tom flicked his wand, and the goblet lurched forward, causing the wine to dribble in rivulets down his chin, then dripped onto his cravat, leaving dark purple stains.</p><p>Tom made a little “tsk” sound and tilted his head. “Shame about that cravat.”</p><p>Abraxas glared at him, but he shivered at the coldness in Tom’s eyes.</p><p>One by one, they each drank from the goblet.</p><p>Tom waited as the veritaserum worked its potency in their veins.</p><p>“Each of you pledged your loyalty to me. I made you all witness to a magical transformation of incredible rarity. As you took my mark, you were also lying to me in the same breath. I’ve been made aware that you had intended Hermione Dumbledore to be there at Riddle House a fortnight ago. Let me ask you all something. Did I give any of you permission to disclose the location of our base of operations?”</p><p>The Death Eaters were silent.</p><p>Tom’s face was hardened marble. “Don’t worry,” he said with a cold smile. “You will all talk.”</p><p>Tom approached Macnair. He glared down at the death eater’s hooked nose and mousy brown hair. “Charles. Who’s idea was it to send a note to my flat by owl?”</p><p>“Malfoy.”</p><p>Tom’s jaw muscles tensed as he grit his teeth. His eyes cut to Abraxas.</p><p>“My Lord, I meant it as a test-”</p><p>“You will speak when spoken to, <em> Malfoy </em>.”</p><p>Tom rolled his head on his shoulders, cracking his neck. “Macnair, was the note intended for Hermione Dumbledore?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Will I find this memory in your mind?”</p><p>Macnair was beginning to sweat. He fought against the veritaserum, but it was the most powerful brew one could create. Tom had brewed it himself, and he was rather a master of potions. He used the most expensive ingredients, and he had modified it slightly so that its effectiveness was second to none.</p><p>“No,” Macnair said, his lip trembling.</p><p>“Why is that?”</p><p>“Because… because we obliviated one another.”</p><p>Tom smiled, then he looked at each of them. “And why would you do that?”</p><p>Macnair shook his head, fighting against the potion.</p><p>Tom stood over him. “I asked you a question, which you <em> will </em>answer, Charles.”</p><p>“We thought you might be getting led astray by Dumbledore’s daughter.”</p><p>Tom seethed. “Why would you think such a thing?”</p><p>Bullets of sweat beaded down the death eater’s forehead. “I- I-”</p><p>“I? I?” Tom gripped his greasy hair, too full of product and ripped his head back to stare into his eyes. He whipped out his wand and shoved it beneath his chin. “Why would you think such a thing?”</p><p>“Dolohov,” he sputtered. “He s-said he saw her. L-Leaving your flat.”</p><p>Tom released him roughly. His gaze turned sharply to Dolohov.</p><p>Dolohov shook his head, but said nothing. His pupils were blown wide with fear.</p><p>“Dolohov, you seem to be a repeat offender these days. Mind telling me why you are spreading your lascivious lies throughout this group?”</p><p>Dolohov’s eyes darted around the room. “She wrote all those articles. The cunt’s going to end up having us all chucked in Azkaban, at this rate. You should’ve dealt with her <em> already </em>.”</p><p>A terrifying smile curved Tom’s lips. “Please, continue informing me about everything I <em> should </em>be doing. You’re clearly the mastermind here.”</p><p>Tom circled the table until he stood before Dolohov. He bent down until he was eye level with Dolohov. “You know what will get you chucked in Azkaban real quick? If you <em> fuck </em>with Albus Dumbledore’s only daughter. I’d let you get sent away and I’d leave you there… like the blithering imbecile that you are.”</p><p>There were snickers around the table.</p><p>“Dumbledore will have to be dealt with, too,” muttered Dolohov. “One day.”</p><p>“One day,” Tom agreed, nodding. “But not today. Forgive me, but, have you suddenly transformed into a dark lord capable of dismantling an entire regime? The statute itself? If so, by all means, don’t let me stop you. I will bow out quite gracefully.” Tom looked around at his death eaters. “Are you all suddenly following the commands of Maximillian Dolohov?”</p><p>There were quick shakes of heads, and denials that echoed through the drawing room.</p><p>He nodded. “Right.”</p><p>Tom hauled back and threw a punch squarely in his jaw. There was a loud crack as his fist connected with bone.</p><p>“Fuck!” exclaimed Dolohov, with a spurt of blood. </p><p>Tom gripped his throat and pushed him back, glaring at him eye to eye. He conjured a blade and pressed it dangerously close to Dolohov’s jugular. “Give me one reason why I shouldn’t kill you now.”</p><p>“Y-you need me.”</p><p>Tom shook his head coldly. “I don’t.” He laughed and several of the men flinched at the sound. </p><p>“See them?” Tom pointed to his followers. “They won’t come to your rescue. Because if they do, they’ll be next. In fact, they’ll help me bury your body. It’s too bad, really. I took a chance on you, Max. Take a good look at them.” He gestured to his death eaters. “They didn’t want me to let you in. They said not to trust you. Perhaps they were right.”</p><p>Dolohov was shaking. “You c-can trust me.”</p><p>“See, the thing is, Max… This whole thing doesn’t operate based on <em> my </em> trust in <em> you </em>. I don’t trust you at all, truth be told. This organization can only be effective when its members trust its leader fully. It seems you’ve lost that bit of trust, and so you are no longer useful to me, I’m afraid.” Tom pressed the knife against his throat.</p><p>“Wait!” Dolohov panted frantically. “I am loyal, my Lord.”</p><p>“Are you?”</p><p>“Implicitly, my Lord. I cannot lie. The s-serum.”</p><p>“Answer me this. What is the <em> real </em>reason for your intense dislike of Hermione Dumbledore?”</p><p>Dolohov breathed heavily. “Walburga.”</p><p>Tom’s eyes narrowed. “Explain yourself.”</p><p>“Walburga wants her dead.”</p><p>Tom gazed at him incredulously. “Why would <em> you </em>care what Walburga wants?”</p><p>Dolohov sighed and lowered his head. “Because I’m in love with her.”</p><p>Tom watched him in silence. He blinked. Then, he began to laugh. “Fucking hell, Max, you are a blithering idiot, even more so than I thought.”</p><p>Tom turned and looked at the men seated around the table. “Are you willing to jeopardize everything we are working so hard for, for the sake of this man’s wayward cock?” As the men shook their heads, Tom drove the knife into the wooden table. He sat, taking up his glass of Ogden’s and took a sip. “A crime of passion. I can’t fault you there, Max. But should you transgress again, I will, quite literally, have your head on a pike.”</p><p>Tom looked to Malfoy. “What’s this about your little test?”</p><p>Abraxas cleared his throat. He spoke flatly, as most people did under the influence of veritaserum. “Dolohov wanted to move against Hermione. I suggested a more diplomatic approach. If, perhaps, she truly was becoming too nosy, then she would likely choose to show up at Riddle House to investigate. When she did, you could deal with her yourself, rather than us. We thought it much more prudent.”</p><p>Tom snorted. “And what did you hope would happen?”</p><p>Abraxas looked Tom dead in the eye. “I hoped she wouldn’t show… and she didn’t.”</p><p>“Why would you hope for such a thing?”</p><p>“Because I care for her.”</p><p>Tom’s jaw tensed. He wasn’t pleased with Abraxas for lying, but he was pleased with his diplomatic and clever approach. “If you care for her, then, why would you make a move against her?”</p><p>Abraxas inclined his head, his eyes grave. He lowered his voice. “You know that I will put our cause above everything. I am here to <em> serve </em>, my Lord.”</p><p>Tom gazed at him, his expression thoughtful. Then, he turned and addressed the room. “Gentlemen, we must be cautious and careful. We must strike only when it will be effective, but also build when it is necessary. Building takes time. It takes resources. It takes cleverness. You are not to enact any plans without my direct orders. Do not act rashly based on assumptions and fears. We will play on others’ fears, but we will not allow fear to rule <em> us </em> . We will only act when we possess <em> all </em> the information there is to possess. We will keep our eyes open and our mouths shut. And we will not think with our <em> cocks </em>.” Tom shot a pointed glance at Dolohov, and then lit another cigarette. “A wise man once said, ‘Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you move, fall like a thunderbolt.’” They didn’t need to know it was a muggle war general who had once said it. </p><p>“Hermione Dumbledore is not your concern. Leave her to me. That same wise man also said, ‘The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting.’ We will win through patience. We will take advantage of any and all opportunities, and we will wisely avoid conflict until it is necessary. It is not necessary to move against Albus Dumbledore’s daughter so soon. That is a move that is far too dangerous to attempt at the present time.”</p><p>Tom had read the words of that muggle general so many times that they were deeply ingrained in his mind. At various times, the words of Sun Tzu would resurface in his mind. This was one such time. </p><p>
<em> If soldiers are punished before they have grown attached to you, they will not prove submissive; and unless submissive, they will be practically useless. Treat your men as you would your own beloved sons, and they will follow you into the deepest valley. </em>
</p><p>Tom sucked smoke into his lungs. “I think you all know that I am nothing if not practical. If you all have concerns, doubts, suggestions, or fears, do not hesitate to voice those to me. Only then, can we be a solid, unified brotherhood. We have been close since childhood, have we not? Since we all met on day one in the Great Hall at Hogwarts. We are brothers. Comrades. Do not fear to come to me. I do not despise doubt. I do despise <em> lies </em> , and disloyalty. You all know that everything I do, is done with purpose. What I do with Hermione Dumbledore is <em> my </em> concern. Rest assured, I am already dealing with her situation at <em> The Daily Prophet </em>. It will be taken care of.”</p><p>There were murmurings among them. Tom let them murmur.</p><p>“In fact,” he continued, “I will need your aid at the ministry, Mulciber. As well as you, Rosier. We will talk about that later.” </p><p>“Yes, my Lord. Anything you need, it will be done.”</p><p>Tom stood and approached Dolohov. “I am going to need memories to corroborate these claims, just so that I have all the facts. Information is priceless, is it not? But I don’t believe that I need all of your memories. I think I only need to search one mind today.” He stared down at Dolohov, his disgust barely concealed. </p><p>“You are the offender here, Max. Unfortunately, your memories have been obliviated. At the present time, there’s only one sure fire way to recover those memories.” He gave Dolohov a false look of pity. “The cruciatus.”</p><p>Dolohov’s eyes widened and he shook his head, thrashing at the scaly serpents binding him. “No, no, no, no, please, <em> no </em>!” His voice grew to a guttural shout as his panic rose.</p><p>Tom sighed and put out his cigarette. “It brings me no pleasure to do this, Max. But, I think we can all agree that you brought it upon yourself, and I do so look forward to finding out everything you’ve been hiding. This is good for you, by the way. Perhaps, it will teach you not to think with your cock. There’s much better pussy out there than Walburga, I guarantee you. In my opinion, there’s nothing worse than a cuntstruck wizard.”</p><p>“Isn’t that what you are?”</p><p>The room was so silent, one could’ve heard a pin drop.</p><p>Tom smirked and leaned down to Dolohov’s eye level. “You know what they say, Max. Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer. Besides, there’s not a witch or wizard alive who can defeat me, save perhaps Dumbledore himself. You know what that makes me?”</p><p>Dolohov’s chest heaved in panic, frantic with fear of what was to come. He swallowed thickly.</p><p>Tom winked. “It makes me the fucking boss.”</p><p>Tom’s crucio was silent, but the guttural scream that ripped through Dolohov’s vocal chords penetrated even the thick, ancient walls of Malfoy Manor, causing the portraits to hide out of their frames. His screams broke into sobs intermittently, but Tom didn’t relent, Hermione’s face ever at the forefront of his mind. He dragged every last ounce of pain out of his death eater’s body, along with each and every memory locked away in the shadowy recesses of Dolohov’s mind.</p>

<h2 class="heading">The Cave</h2>
</div>

<div class="userstuff">
<p align="center"> </p><p>Tom made his way to the gate of Malfoy Manor and apparated away.</p><p>He appeared on a rocky shore, just beneath a cragged cliff side.</p><p>He ripped at his collar, loosening his tie in frustration as he stood seething. He dragged his breath through his teeth, nostrils flaring.</p><p>He suddenly whipped his wand out and threw a curse. The cliffside crumbled in its entirety as sharp rocks cascaded in a thunderous landslide into the gray ocean.</p><p>Tom flicked his wand again, and the sea curled around itself as he flourished it, manipulating the currents of the water until a powerful storm began to brew at sea. Giant waves rose, cresting and then falling one after another. Tom wondered if wizards really received their power from the gods. Perhaps his father had been Poseidon. He had always felt a kinship with the sea, capricious and unforgiving as it was. He loved the temperamental nature of water, the way it could swallow whole anything that dared to venture into its jaws. Tom wanted to wield that kind of power. He was at a point in his life where he felt like the unmoving, still waters of the sea; the calm before the storm. He hated the stagnancy. He wanted chaos and eruption. He wanted to demonstrate his powers like a destructive, raging hurricane. He desired to rule as a god. Perhaps the legends were true, after all. The stories he’d read made the gods seem volatile and unhinged. Tom could relate to that.</p><p>He craved magic. All of it. He wanted to wield it so readily that his mortal body could not contain its ferocity. </p><p>Tom fine tuned the storm the storm, building it layer upon layer like a skilled craftsman only fluent in chaos and disorder.</p><p>As if bidden, the clouds darkened and lightning struck. Tom expended a great deal of magical energy to create the force of the storm, but it barely made a dent in his stores of magic. He’d practiced for years, pushing himself like a madman to demonstrate a little more each time.</p><p>With a piercing scream of anger, he pointed his wand to the sky and a jagged bolt of lightning lit the dark clouds, falling directly into the heart of the ocean below. Bright white lit the sky, and the electric current spread over the surface of the water like a blanket, creating a plane of death.</p><p>Tom craved violence. Perhaps he possessed the power of Ares, god of war. He wanted blood. His anger knew no bounds.</p><p>He had not meant a single word he uttered to his death eaters. They were not his brothers. They were his servants. He’d wanted nothing better than to Avada the lot of them.</p><p>But Tom was wise, cunning and crafty. He was like the calm sea, beautiful and alluring, with the potential for great death and destruction simmering just beneath the surface.</p><p>Dolohov had, for months, been hiding his disloyalty. He’d read the wizard’s thoughts; it all stemmed from a woman. Walburga Black.</p><p>Dolohov resented Tom’s treatment of her.</p><p>Tom fumed at the level of irritation that one witch could cause. Was Tom also this delusional about Hermione?</p><p>He seethed, knowing that she held such a tight grip on his emotions.</p><p>Was this her plan? Did she think that she could change his course with her smiles?</p><p>It mattered not. She would have to fit in with his plans. There was no other way. Tom would not allow himself to be distracted. </p><p>Tom had read their minds. He was able to do so with subjects who were unskilled occlumens. His death eaters were loyal; they fumed at Dolohov, many of them wishing that Tom had just killed him. </p><p>Perhaps Tom should’ve, but there was something he liked about the man. Tom had always had a strange affinity for those who possessed a streak of madness. Dolohov was as unhinged as Tom, and when wrangled properly, that trait could be quite useful.</p><p>Tom let the storm surge to a halt. The tumultuous waves crashed violently before leveling out, returning to their once peaceful state. </p><p>Tom turned and began to make his way to the cave.</p><p>He hadn’t come here in years. </p><p>He stood in the mouth of the cave, peering into the darkness.</p><p>It was in this place that Tom had first learned to wield magic for a purpose.</p><p>He’d learned it made him powerful.</p><p>He only came here to remind himself of where he’d come from. Once in his life, he’d felt inconsequential. He’d felt strange and out of place in the world of muggles, as if the rejection of his father were only a reflection of his not belonging. </p><p>He’d had so many instances of accidental magic that the children at the orphanage feared him. </p><p>But those two… they were the worst.</p><p>He hadn’t minded being taunted for being different. For being powerful. For being <em> strange </em>.</p><p>He’d always been those things, with or without his magic.</p><p>But these two children, they didn’t fixate on his magic. They’d called him <em> unwanted </em>.</p><p>He never forgot their names.</p><p>One night, after one of the new orphanage workers took a shining to Tom and gave him extra bread at dinner time, Dennis Bishop turned to Tom and whispered from his cot, “You’ll never mean anything to anyone, Riddle. You’re not the same as us.”</p><p>“That’s right,” spat Amy Benson. She’d snuck underneath Bishop’s cot, as she often did at night. “See, our parents are dead. But your dad is still out there somewhere, and he doesn’t think of you at all. He didn’t <em> want </em> you. That’s why you’ll always be an orphan.”</p><p>He didn’t regret what he’d done to them. </p><p>Tom had once even thought of tracking them down and doing unspeakable things to them. Whenever his past began to rear its ugly head, he laid in his bed and imagined torturing them with the cruciatus.</p><p>He’d even contemplated ending their pitiful existences. He would feel deeply gratified in using their deaths to make his final horcruxes.</p><p>But he was past it all now. He’d trained himself to suppress his feelings of rejection and inadequacy until they were essentially nonexistent of late. For years, his emotions had been like impenetrable stone. It had been quite some time since he’d felt these things.</p><p>Why did he suddenly feel them now? They rose up within him like bile, threatening to choke him.</p><p><em> Hermione </em>. She’d somehow chipped away at his icy heart, holding a match to it just to watch it melt.</p><p>Tom hated <em> feeling </em> things. He hated weakness.</p><p>He gritted his teeth and waved his wand, sending a ball of light out of his wand. It drifted through the cave and sunk below the black waters, illuminating its depths as it fell deeper.</p><p>Tom had shown those two children their parents’ deaths in the depths of the water. He’d used his natural gift of legilimency for weeks, drawing out the most intricate details of their childhoods, their parents’ appearances, how their voices sounded. Any details that might make it seem more realistic.</p><p>He’d made the visions absolutely brutal.</p><p>They’d relived their beloved parents’ deaths, and listened as their parents called to them, begging them for help. </p><p>Tom had reveled in their tears, in their fear and hopelessness, like a dementor seeking to suck every bit of joy from their souls.</p><p>Then, he’d shown them death itself; a black monster, like a dragon, that broke through the surface of the water and uttered in a terrible voice, promising them a death like that of their miserable parents.</p><p>They hadn’t spoken for weeks after that.</p><p>In fact, they’d never been quite the same after.</p><p>“You are nothing. You have nothing. You were born from nothing. You have nothing to offer. She will figure that out sooner or later.”</p><p>Alphard Black’s words rang in his ears.</p><p>Black reminded Tom of Dennis quite a bit. Perhaps that was the reason he disliked Alphard instantly.</p><p>Tom felt violence seeping into his veins, pulling his muscles taut with the need to release pain. </p><p>The torture curse had not been nearly enough to sate his need to cause suffering. Dolohov deserved much worse, but he would be of no use to Tom as an invalid. He still needed him to be capable of wielding a wand. </p><p>His next transgression would be his last. Tom had no patience for insubordination. </p><p>Then there was Walburga Black. He had precisely the perfect plan for how to deal with her, when the time came.</p><p>Which brought him around to his witch.</p><p>Frustration had been building in Tom the past few days.</p><p>It was high time that he dealt with her and her little articles. He’d known this for a while, but he’d planned to deal with her potion habit first.</p><p>Had he not bent over backward for her? He had avoided using legilimency on her, even though he was fully capable. He’d sat back silently as she called him out in the papers, as she taunted him and his death eaters publicly, as she kept her secrets, tight-lipped and distrusting of him, when he’d never given her a reason not to trust him.</p><p>Perhaps, in the future, but here and now? No.</p><p>He was frustrated by the specter of himself that haunted her, when he was here before her, a flesh and blood man, all but pledging his loyalty to her.</p><p>He hadn’t given her those scars, and he wasn’t familiar with the version of himself that had caused them.</p><p>Something had dramatically transformed him in those sixty years.</p><p>He’d given her his horcrux.</p><p>She’d made all the moves.</p><p>Now it was his turn.</p><p>Tom smiled as he gazed into the water. He saw the faces of Amy and Dennis staring back at him, their eyes infected with fear. </p><p>He’d been studying with Hausler, practicing the incantation for the creation of Inferi. </p><p>Tom had decided on his first test subjects.</p><p>Once he located Amy and Dennis, he would put them out of their misery. It had been quite a while since he’d cast the killing curse and his wand hand was itching.</p><p>Then he would make them his first Inferi, and bury them deep within the lake where they’d once relived the death of their parents. Then they would protect his horcruxes, like little corpse cadets.</p><p>It was quite a poetic death, really. </p><p>Tom sometimes thought he was rather a magical artist of sorts, somewhat like the muggle artists Francisco Goya, or Hieronymous Bosch. Only his art was magic and the macabre. </p><p>Bosch had painted the seven deadly sins. </p><p>Tom would craft seven deadly horcruxes.</p><p>There was really only one deadly sin, after all, and Tom was quite skilled in its subtleties.</p><p><em> Everyone has their hobbies, I suppose </em>.</p><p>Whatever penalty he was owed in the afterlife for his sins would have to wait. Presumably forever, if his goals worked according to plan.</p><p>But what of Hermione? Would she also live forever, if he bound his soul to hers? Would the soul bond still work effectively with his soul split apart?</p><p>He was only two weeks away from the completion of the potion. He still needed his tears, and that presented a small problem, as he'd never cried in his entire life, as far as his memory served him. Perhaps there was a potion that would help him produce tears; a laughing potion perhaps, such as Alihotsy draught.</p><p>Perhaps, the old adage of chopping an onion. Something was bound to work.</p><p>It would be finished two days before Christmas. </p><p>He chuckled to himself as he imagined the look of horror on her face as he presented her with a vial of the blue potion, wrapped up with a pretty bow.</p><p>
<em> Congratulations, little witch, you’re never getting away from me. Oh, and I’m going to stitch your soul to mine whether you like it or not. </em>
</p><p>Then, she really would be chained to the devil. He would drag her to the Underworld with him, his very own Persephone, to reign at his side as the Lord of Death.</p>

<em><br/>
Wool’s Orphanage </em>
</p><p align="center">
<em> November 2, 1934 </em>
</p><p>
<em> The day was bleak and gloomy; winter had come early and the ground was frosted with myriad tiny flakes of ice. The trees were nearly bare already. Tom Riddle had hoped that the color would last, but alas, there was no such luck in store for him. </em>
</p><p>
<em> He stood in the courtyard of the orphanage with a group of boys, numbering three, and began to do what Tom did best: ordering them around. </em>
</p><p>
<em> The appointed task for the day was to assassinate the birds that perched in the great oak trees. </em>
</p><p>
<em> He was nearly nine years of age, and young Tom Riddle always had a way of forming his own brigade of followers, despite the fear that most of the children focused upon him. He was a natural born leader, with his manner being both commanding and subdued. It was a rather unnerving gift that he possessed which caused him to be able to elicit trust from individuals, despite being one who was the least deserving of it. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Very few would call that magic, but a kind of magic, it most certainly was. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “The birds... They are carrying messages to our enemy, and must be stopped,” said Tom. He had a vivid imagination, and since he recently had begun to have powers which he could not explain, his world was thrown into a kind of phantasmagoria of fever dream-like quality. Anything and everything was possible, and Tom could no longer differentiate the real from the imagined. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Our enemy?” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Mrs. Cole.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “No!” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Yes.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “How do you know that?” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “I have seen it,” whispered Tom conspiratorially. “They watched me sneak out at night and I know they have told her. She feeds them in return for their putrid services. They must be stopped.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “How’d you sneak out?” asked Billy Stubbs. “The doors are always locked!” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Stop asking questions. We will need weapons.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “And bait!” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “What bait?” asked Timothy. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Candace.” Tom gestured to a chubby, red-haired girl who sat alone under a leaf-less tree. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “A girl?” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Yes.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Because birds think girls are trees!” exclaimed Billy. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “You prat,” said Eric Whalley disdainfully. “Haven’t you seen the pictures of Snow White in the storybooks? They must sit on her finger!” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Nobody reads girl books, you plum!” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “On the contrary,” said Tom. “The most dangerous things are hidden in the most innocent disguises, just like these demon birds. You can learn about anything from anywhere, even from girl books, and now you have no idea how to lure the birds, so sit down and be quiet, Billy. You know nothing.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> The boy sat down, sullen and confused. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “But why must we kill them?” asked Timothy sadly. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “To defend ourselves against Mrs. Cole’s red, sickle-and-hammer regime, of course. You know she sides with the communists,” Tom stated, matter-of-factly. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Oh.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Have you heard about that bloke Adolf Hitler?” asked Timothy. “I heard the cooks in the kitchen talking.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “I’ve been at the orphanage longest, and so I am the leader,” said Billy. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “We should spear them, and hang them up as a warning to her, like they used to do with pirates at the docks,” said Eric murderously. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “We could spear Candace too,” he added after considering. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “We will,” said Tom seriously. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Tom should be the leader, since he thought of it. Besides,” Eric added knowingly, “Tom snuck out at night.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “He could be lying,” said Billy. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Candace!” called Riddle. “Come here.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “I am the leader,” he added, “because I can build things.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “So?” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “So, Jesus was a carpenter. You are my disciples.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Since when?” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “I heard Mrs. Cole telling Miss Madeline that she was an ‘atheist.’ So we shall be Christians.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “What’s an atheist?” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “I’m not sure. But... it’s the opposite of a Christian, and so that’s what we shall be.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “I learned a song,” said Timothy, “when I used to go to church before my Father died. Something about Christian soldiers and marching and war and holding our banner high.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “This is our banner,” said Tom as he removed his threadbare coat and threw it on a stick. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “I don’t think that Christians would spear the poor birds,” Timothy whimpered. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “That is the sort of foolish theory you would have,” said Eric. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “These are not birds,” said Tom. “They are demons of the foulest kind. Our enemy has bred these with evil dark creatures!” </em>
</p><p>
<em> At this, the boys went hysterical. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “We’ve got to wipe them out!” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Destroy them!” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Feed them to the wolves!” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “What wolves?” asked Timothy nervously. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “We shall eat them ourselves!” yelled Eric. “And drink their blood!” </em>
</p><p>This was Tom Riddle’s idea of play<em>. </em>He had no true desire for religion, only that he knew he must have some grand ideology for his followers to cling to. In this way, he understood something at a young age that the world's most destructive dictators had also learned: to appeal to the fears, the morality and the emotional loyalties of his followers. He sought to create a mob mentality, a sense of banding together for some greater cause or mission.</p><p>He also precociously understood social hierarchies and how to wield the weapon of jealousy and competition.</p><p>
<em> “You are my second-in-command, Eric. You are my John.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Who is John?” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “I heard the priest say when we went for confession. He was Christ’s sidekick, as it were.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Oh.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Candace, come here,” said Tom. “You must sit there under the tree and let the birds come to you and rest on you.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> The girl rubbed her eyes. “What for?” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Be quiet; you are a girl. You must hold this seed, and we will kill the fiends.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “What if they peck me?” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “We won’t let them, Candace,” said Timothy reassuringly. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “After all, they’ll only eat your eyes,” said Eric maliciously. Tom smirked. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “No! I won’t do it!” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “We will kill you if you don’t,” said Eric. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “He’s right, we will. You might as well do it,” Tom cajoled. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “I won’t do anything for you, Tom. I thought you were nice, but Beatrice told me what you did to Charlie Fawks!” </em>
</p><p>
<em> He stood passively with his hands in his pockets, looking at her politely, though somewhat threateningly. “And… what did I do to Charlie Fawks?” </em>
</p><p>
<em> Her eyes grew wide as she shook her head. “I… I don’t wanna say.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> His face cleared prettily. “Come on, Candy, you know you’re the only girl pretty enough to be the bait. Besides, we must achieve victory!” The boys began chanting the word “victory.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> Candace hesitantly relented. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Now, we must lug these rocks at them.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “They are eating the seeds!” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Of course they are, you great twat!” Eric snapped. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “What a word!” marveled Timothy. “Where did you learn it?” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “One of the men Miss Madeline brings over at night.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “We can’t throw these rocks!” wailed Timothy, ever soft-hearted. “We’re going to hit Candace if we do!” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “This isn’t going to work,” said Billy. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “We must!” cried Eric feverishly. “It’s the only way! You men are cowards!” He began to throw the rocks, without particular aim. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “I’m Peter!” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “I’m Saint John!” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “For Christ’s holy mission!” </em>
</p><p>
<em> Tom threw a stone with modern precision at a sparrow, catching it on the head and knocking it dead. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Tom Marvolo Riddle!” </em>
</p><p>
<em> The boys whipped around to find Miss Madeline, face aghast, running toward them. Tom was last to turn. Eric tossed a few more stones at Candace until she finally ran away, crying and bruised. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Tom! What on earth are you doing? You’ve killed the sparrows!” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “A sparrow, Madame. Only one.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “It was a bully, anyway,” said Eric. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “And a terrorist,” said Tom. “Wouldn’t be surprised to see the rest of them vanish into smoke like the devils they are. They’ve probably warned her of our assault.” He turned back to Madeline. “I suppose she sent you?” </em>
</p><p>
<em> She appeared incredulous, and proceeded with her usual tirade. “Riddle, I have no idea on God’s green earth what you are talking about. I’ve half a mind to tell Mrs. Cole what you’ve got up to. Talking to snakes and killing birds. Giving yourself over to these wild imaginings. You know who else talked to snakes? Eve! Look where that ended her up! Snakes are possessed by the devil and so are you, Riddle. Last week you called Mrs. Cole a communist. You’re a right little devil, Riddle, and no mistake. You know she’s awfully fond of watching the birds, and here you are throwing stones at them.” She glared at Eric. “And at poor Candace too!” She sighed. “I hate to do it, but no dinner for any of you tonight. Now, back inside, all of you.” </em>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Tom awoke violently and sat up straight in bed. His chest heaved violently, beads of sweat pouring down his face. </p><p>“Fuck,” he whispered, trying desperately to regulate his breathing. He glanced beside him, assuring himself that Hermione was sleeping peacefully.</p><p>Tom pressed the heel of his palm to his forehead, his hands trembling uncontrollably. </p><p>Tom stood and slid on his trousers and quietly left the bedroom.</p><p>Tom wandlessly lit the fireplace and sat in an armchair in the sitting room. He stared into the fire, trying to make sense of his dreams.</p><p>Or were they nightmares?</p><p>Fear took hold of Tom.</p><p>He’d been back in that little church that the orphanage matron had always brought them to. Tom put no stock in muggle religions, and he didn’t believe in God. He wasn’t even sure he believed in <em> the gods </em>. </p><p>But then again, Tom thought it best to leave some things mysterious. The origins of magic were an enigma, like magic itself. </p><p>Despite his disbelief, some things had been drilled into him during his muggle upbringing. </p><p>He hadn’t been quite truthful with Hermione. It was true that there wasn’t always enough food to go around. But that wasn’t the only reason he often didn’t eat. One of the orphanage matrons believed that children should fast as a sign of penance for their sins.</p><p>And according to the matrons, Tom had committed a great many sins.</p><p>If they only knew how many he’d committed since. </p><p>Tom had always been permeated by a deep sense of something <em> other </em>.</p><p>He knew that something else existed outside of himself and his world.</p><p>That unknown reality was the thing he feared most.</p><p>Did a God exist? Were the gods real?</p><p>Was there some hellish afterlife awaiting Tom?</p><p>Not if he had anything to say about it. Deep down, his desire for immortality had little to do with the desire to live forever, and all to do with the need to avoid what comes <em> after </em>.</p><p>He’d never believed in fate. He believed in himself, and put his trust in the idea that he could create his reality. But even that had limitations.</p><p>Was Hermione a part of his fate? He believed it was so, to the very core of his being.</p><p>Tom thought of the dream, and it sent a shiver down his spine. He saw the stained glass windows, a portrait of Jesus and his sheep, except the windows had moved, as magical portraits often did, and the eyes of Christ bore into him.</p><p>He’d awoken with his heart rapidly racing. </p><p>Fear. It was tangible.</p><p>Very few things could terrify Tom. But the thought of the afterlife shook him. </p><p>Was it possible that there would be no tallying of wrongs done? Tom had studied the life of Adolf Hitler at length, having grown up during his rule and felt the shadow of his reign of terror looming over Great Britain. He found him a fascinating character, but Tom often wondered if someone so evil would not one day be sent to a deep pit in Hades.</p><p>And if so, would the same fate await Tom?</p><p><em> Invictus </em>, Tom reminded himself. Unconquerable. The master of his own fate.</p><p>He decided it was time to make yet another horcrux. It had been years since he had last made one. He still had no idea whether it was possible to split his soul seven times, but he would find out, or he would die trying. He'd already made two, so he could essentially be brought back if his plans went awry.</p><p>Tom had seen Herpo the Foul in his dream. Tom had often wondered what the sorcerer looked like. </p><p>The wizard was tall, about Tom’s height, and thin and lanky, with long limbs and a wiry build. His hair was black like Tom’s and long. He’d worn it tied back. </p><p>His eyes were a scarlet red, mirroring Tom’s own, but they were terrifying to behold, his pupils shaped like diamonds and the crimson irises were marbled like kaleidoscopes, giving him a serpent-like appearance. He had a noble Roman nose and sharp, distinct features.</p><p>Tom had been dumbstruck in the presence of the powerful wizard. They had stood watching one another for some time, before Herpo smiled at Tom sinisterly. Then, he disappeared.</p><p>Tom had felt chills in the dream. </p><p>He didn’t know what it meant or why the wizard was appearing to him now.</p><p>“Tom?”</p><p>Tom looked up to find Hermione was standing in the arched opening of the hallway, clad only in a silky emerald nightgown, her thick hair tumbling wildly over her shoulders and her eyes drowsy with sleep. “What are you doing awake?”</p><p>Tom’s eyes raked over her. “I was just thinking,” he muttered.</p><p>She looked to the golden clock on her mantle which sat beneath a glass dome. “It’s still early. Do you want to go back to sleep?”</p><p>He stood and crossed the room to stand before her. He ran his tongue over his top teeth as he whispered huskily, “No. I do not.”</p><p>She swallowed, her eyes suddenly more awake. “What do you want to do?”</p><p>He wrapped his hand around the back of her neck and pulled her closer as he leaned in and whispered, “I want to fuck.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Gaspard pressed his wand to his voice box and used the transceiver charm to page his assistant. </p><p>“Molly can you send Mr. Bones in, please.”</p><p>“Right away, Mr. Dufresne,” came the woman’s voice from the end of his wand. </p><p>A few moments later, a knock came at the door.</p><p>“Come in,” Gaspard called.</p><p>The auror stepped into the office and closed the door.</p><p>“Eustace, do you have a report on Mr. Riddle?”</p><p>“Yes, sir. I turned it in to the Minister this morning.”</p><p>Gaspard sat staring at him for a few moments. “You should always run reports by me before sending them elsewhere, Mr. Bones.”</p><p>Eustace reddened sheepishly. Gaspard was somewhat of an idol to him, and he took any bit of criticism hard. “Apologies, sir. She sent a memo this morning, asking for it.”</p><p>“Did she now?”</p><p>Eustace swallowed, then nodded.</p><p>Gaspard sat back in his seat, deep in thought. He held his wand in both hands, toying with it idly.</p><p>He’d spent the first few days staking out under disillusionment near Riddle’s apartment building. He’d seen nothing. No comings or goings, which he found rather odd at first. He came to the conclusion that Riddle apparated directly out of his apartment, which made sense as Knockturn Alley was a rather unsavory place to frequent. After a few days, he’d put Eustace onto the charge, because Gaspard found he had much more important tasks to focus his energy on. </p><p>Still, he would’ve liked to have received a copy of the report before it was traded into the Minister’s hands.</p><p>“What were your findings?”</p><p>Eustace cleared his throat. “Well, through a bit of asking around, I managed to find out he was at Malfoy Manor on Saturday. Spends a good bit of time with the pureblooded set. Always did. We were schoolmates once upon a time.” </p><p>Gaspard nodded thoughtfully. His eyes flicked to Eustace. He was a fantastic wizard, a half-blooded Hufflepuff, and one of Gaspard’s best and brightest. He trusted him most of all his aurors. “Is that all?”</p><p>“Um, well… no.”</p><p>Gaspard fixed him with a stare. “Continue, Bones.”</p><p>Eustace turned his head this way and that, as if ensuring that no one was listening, though the office was empty. “I went by his flat yesterday early, before work. Figured I’d sit out and drink my coffee and see if I caught anything. It’s quite creepy out in Knockturn Alley early in the morning.”</p><p>Gaspard raised his eyebrows, a silent urge to proceed, and quickly.</p><p>“Well, the lights were on in the windows and I saw the curtain open. There was a woman looking out. I’m positive it was his flat.”</p><p>“Did you capture a photograph?”</p><p>“I tried, but it’s a bit blurry. Was still dark out, and I was a bit far away.”</p><p>Gaspard’s eyebrows knit. “Alright. Do you have the photograph? Bring me the report.”</p><p>“Yes, sir. Straightaway, sir.”</p><p>Eustace quickly left the office and returned with a folder. He handed it to Gaspard gingerly.</p><p>Gaspard flipped open the folder and stared at the moving photograph. Eustace may not have recognized the woman, but Gaspard deciphered her identity immediately. It was unmistakably Hermione Dumbledore. Gaspard was all too familiar with her delicate features and thick, curling hair. He knew it was her instantly, despite the blurriness of the photo. Her hair was slightly mussed and she wore what looked like a man’s shirt, as it swallowed her small frame.</p><p>Gaspard’s jaw tensed.</p><p>“You sent this to the Minister?”</p><p>Eustace looked abashed. “I did, sir. I’m sorry. I didn’t want to bother you with it. I know you’re busy with the Kenilworth raids.”</p><p>“Be sure to send everything by my desk in the future. You already know this.”</p><p>“Yes, sir, I apologize. I do know this. It’s my mistake.”</p><p>Gaspard took a deep breath and muttered, “You may go, Eustace.”</p><p>The auror looked quite mortified. He took a bow, and left quietly.</p><p>Gaspard ran his hand over his face, rubbing his chin thoughtfully. He’d known there was something between the witch and Riddle, but he hadn’t suspected this. It was frequently talked about and even reported that she and Riddle despised one another. </p><p>Perhaps it was all a cover for their affair. But why would Hermione feel the need to hide it?</p><p>And why did Tuft want Riddle watched? From the looks of it, she was frequently promoting him as a young wizard with brilliant political vision and unparalleled magical ability. They seemed to be quite connected in all the same circles, and this reputation he was garnering made Gaspard all the more curious if there was any truth to these claims.</p><p>Gaspard couldn’t help but feel a pang of jealousy as he stared at the photograph of Hermione. He had no reason to feel jealousy, but it was there, curling around his insides. </p><p>Gaspard had heard talk of Riddle. In truth, he’d asked around about him since he’d seen Hermione with him at the banquet. Minister Tuft’s assignment had sharpened his curiosity about the young wizard. </p><p>Almost everyone knew Riddle in some way. Charming, charismatic young half-blood. Had all the witches atwitter. Suspected practitioner of dark magic, but there was no real evidence to back up those claims. Found frequently in the company of powerful pureblood families. Close with the Malfoys. Works at a shop reputed for trading in dark magic and cursed artifacts. </p><p><em> Quite strange </em> , thought Gaspard. <em> Particularly for a young man with such exceptional educational achievements.  </em></p><p>It seemed he had a slightly more ominous reputation than Gaspard had first assumed. He wasn’t really the sort that Gaspard could see Hermione with. In fact, he seemed quite the opposite of anyone Hermione would want to associate with.</p><p>But maybe Gaspard had misread her. He was very trusting of his intuition; it rarely failed him. But he admitted to himself that his own feelings for her could be clouding his judgment a bit.</p><p>Gaspard cocked his jaw to the side. Perhaps she was like many proper, well-to-do witches; she had an affinity for bad boys. That would explain it. Riddle definitely fit the bill.</p><p>However, Gaspard fumed that Tuft was in possession of this information. He wouldn’t have turned it over to her, if it had been up to him. Perhaps it was his loyalty to Albus, but Gaspard felt the need to protect Hermione. He didn’t know why he distrusted Wilhelmina Tuft, but his intuition seldom led him astray. </p><p>The question was: should Gaspard approach Albus with this information? Would that be a breach of Hermione’s privacy?</p><p>Gaspard chewed the inside of his cheek as he contemplated. </p><p>A few minutes later, he stood and tucked his wand in the inner pocket of his robes. Then, he took up his cloak and made his way out of the office. </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Hermione packed up her quill and scrolls. She had just finished interviewing Wilhelmina Tuft and the Minister now sat for the Prophet photographer whilst he tried to get the best photograph for the front page. The interview had gone relatively well. Hermione had asked a series of probing questions about her policies and platform, as well as several questions regarding her family and the Tuft thestral breeding program. She questioned her stance regarding the care and protection of magical creatures, also managing to lob her a wild card inquiry about house elf regulation.</p><p>The interview had been pleasant enough. Hermione even thought that perhaps Gaspard had been wrongly informed about the Minister disliking her. </p><p>When the photographer finished his shoot, Minister Tuft called to Hermione, “Would you care to join me for some tea before you go, Miss Dumbledore?”</p><p>Hermione smiled congenially. “I'll never turn down a cup of tea.”</p><p>Wilhelmina’s eyes twinkled. “My assistant makes it best.”</p><p>As her young, handsome assistant placed a silver tray of tea on the desk between them, Wilhelmina gave Hermione a secretive smile. “I must admit, you created quite a stir at my inaugural banquet, showing up with the renowned Mr. Dufresne. His performance on behalf of the DMLE is well-acclaimed.”</p><p>“I’m aware of this,” Hermione said casually.</p><p>“He is a good friend of your father’s, is he not?”</p><p>“He is. Although I can’t really say in what capacity. I haven’t spoken of him much with my father.”</p><p>“I see,” Wilhelmina murmured, cutting her eyes at Hermione. “I don’t mean to pry, but I must say, the two of you look marvelous together. The illustrious reporter, daughter of the famous Dumbledore, and Dufresne, auror revolutionary. Is there perhaps a courtship brewing?”</p><p>Hermione cleared her throat, surprised at the Minister’s quite personal line of questioning. This type of conversation was not unheard of among politicians and ministry workers; Hermione had experienced enough of the behind-the-scenes conduct of famous witches and wizards to know that they could be quite loose. Still, Hermione was one who liked to keep things as professional as possible. </p><p>“I- Well, no. We are just friends, Minister.”</p><p>“Oh,” Wilhelmina smiled. “I confess, I’m disappointed. Of course, I had heard of your break with Mr. Black and well, forgive me for being so candid and familiar with you, but that’s just my way. Most politicians tend to be all fake smiles and business-like, but I prefer a more intimate, heart-to-heart approach. It has aided me well in my career.”</p><p>“It’s no problem, Mrs. Tuft. I admit, it’s refreshing.”</p><p>Wilhelmina smiled widely. “Good. I admit I had hoped for a romantic connection for Gaspard. He has been alone for far too long.”</p><p>Hermione inclined her head. “Well, I imagine he is quite busy with his position at the DMLE. I have a feeling he has no shortage of witches to choose from. I’m sure if he’s alone, it’s by choice.”</p><p>“Oh, yes, absolutely. He is quite relegated to bachelorhood. As is my protégé, Tom Riddle, by the way.” Tuft chuckled. “You should see the witches falling at his feet. I tell him all the time that it’s in his best interest to settle down. But then, he’s still young, and there’s time.”</p><p>“Oh… yes, of course.” Hermione awkwardly took a sip of her tea.</p><p>Tuft flicked her gaze to Hermione. “My goodness, how silly of me. I forgot you and Riddle greatly dislike one another.”</p><p>Hermione cleared her throat. “I wouldn’t necessarily use the word “dislike.” More like, we do not see eye to eye on certain things.”</p><p>“Oh, but of course. He spends his time among the purebloods, whom you so disdainfully mock in your column,” Wilhelmina murmured with a pointed glance.</p><p>“Excuse me, but I do not <em> mock </em>,” Hermione said somewhat heatedly. “I simply disagree fundamentally with the beliefs espoused by those families and the traditions which they keep to. I find them bigoted, elitist, and narrow minded.”</p><p>“How well I know,” Wilhelmina crooned. “I’ve read all of your columns.”</p><p>“Have you?”</p><p>“Oh yes. I find it’s very important to keep myself abreast of current events and with the notoriety you’ve acquired in recent months, it’s only wise that I make myself aware of your political leanings. I found your article about the Azkaban breach to be, while well-written and idealistic, unfortunately lacking in solutions. Although it is important to critique the way that our government is being run, it is also necessary to have plans and proposals, and not just ethics and principles.”</p><p>Hermione’s eyes widened. “Like your proposal of hiring more purebloods in order to make the Ministry more diversified, despite them being the minority in our populace?” she asked sharply, her tone acidic and accusatory. “I think you’ll find that whenever <em>I</em> uncover a problem in wizarding society, I set my keen mind to the task of constructing solutions immediately, as you may have noticed with Midas Bank, of which I am one of the founders and primary investors. Clearly, the Ministry was not doing its job in overseeing the goblins, or they would have already discovered their little plot years ago. The same can be said for Azkaban prison; if the Ministry had the dementors under control and were frequently improving on wards and magical protections, or better yet, had already constructed a prison like to that of Nurmengard, one not founded upon murder and dark magic, <em>perhaps</em> there would not be a dangerous prisoner on the loose.”</p><p>Wilhelmina gave her a tight smile, but her eyes were cold. “You speak as if <em> you’re </em> Minister for Magic, Hermione.”</p><p>Hermione looked at her savagely. “Perhaps, I will be one day.” She looked her up and down once, before saying icily, “And you may call me Miss Dumbledore.”</p><p>Tuft inclined her head in a small nod, eyes slightly narrowed. “Maybe you will be, Miss <em> Dumbledore </em> , provided you don’t anger the powerful families of magical Britain… or continue to taunt a <em>certain</em> dark wizard gang.”</p><p>Hermione’s eyes narrowed as well. “I’m not afraid of dark wizards, Minister.”</p><p>“No, I shouldn’t think that you are. Maybe you’re in league with them. Perhaps all this opposition to dark wizards is really a cover for something. Are you a spy?” Wilhelmina’s musical laughter tinkled charmingly, but it sounded like a threat. “Who knows what you are, Miss Dumbledore. Maybe you’re even a dark wizard’s mistress.”</p><p>Hermione glared at her opponent, for that was what Wilhelmina Tuft had just become. The Minister had no idea what a formidable foe she’d just made of Hermione Dumbledore. Hermione leaned forward with a demure smile. “Who I choose to fuck every night is none of your business, Minister Tuft. Just as it’s none of my business who you’re fucking. But if I was a betting woman, I’d say it was that handsome young assistant who makes such <em>excellent</em> tea.” She stood and sat her tea cup on the desk. “I must be going. I have an article to write. I will attempt to paint a much prettier picture of you than the one you’ve just shown me this morning.”</p><p>At that, Hermione turned and left Wilhelmina’s office, her blood boiling like lava in her veins.</p><p><br/>

</p><p> </p><p><br/>Thunder cracked and rumbled, then receded slowly into the distance. Hermione hurriedly made her way up the cracked and crumbling sidewalk, her heels clacking against the wet concrete. She would’ve cast a rain repelling charm, but she thought it best to fit in with the muggles, so she held a black umbrella above her head, looking every bit the part of a funeral-goer as she passed through the towering iron gate of Wool’s Orphanage.</p><p>She shivered in the icy rain as she climbed up the steep steps to the front doors of the derelict Victorian building. She gripped a large brass knocker, alerting the matron to her presence. After several moments, there was an old caretaker that let her in and led her into a wide foyer. She followed the old man up the staircase and into the matron’s office, where Hermione was left to wait.</p><p>She stood gazing out the only window that the room offered. Twilight was coming quickly, and below the towering orphanage, the lights from the cars crept like inevitable insects along the London streets. Those same lights shone through the torrents of rain, fluctuating and dimming and then flickering like batting lashes. Dark gray clouds hovered to the east, but to the west, despite the rain and the city lights, one lone star could be seen, vivid and defiant. To the north, leaves from the few trees planted outside the saturnine orphanage gates whirled along the street as car after car disturbed their peace.</p><p>Hermione turned as she heard the door open.</p><p>“Well, hello there, Miss. Welcome to Wool’s Orphanage. My apologies for your wait.” The older woman surreptitiously eyed Hermione, taking in her expensive, well-tailored clothes and youthful appearance. “I believe you are the Miss Granger who wrote, if I am not mistaken?”</p><p>“Yes, I am,” said Hermione politely, holding her gloved hand out. </p><p>“Wonderful. I’m Mrs. Cole,” said the matron as she took Hermione’s offered hand. “To what do we owe this visit today?”</p><p>Hermione sat her umbrella aside and slowly doffed her gloves, but she instantly regretted it, as there was quite a pervasive chill in the air that she felt immediately as soon as her skin was exposed. “I would like to have a tour of the orphanage, if you have the time.”</p><p>The woman once again took stock of Hermione, her questions written glaringly across her face. “I could certainly make the time, but what is the purpose of your visit?”</p><p>Hermione looked around her, as if she were critiquing her surroundings. “Well, that remains to be seen. I have a vested interest in this orphanage, but I prefer not to reveal my intentions before I’ve had a good introduction to the place.”</p><p>“I see. Are you interested in adopting any of the children?”</p><p>“That I cannot say yet.”</p><p>The old woman’s hawkish eyes gazed at Hermione with uncertainty. “Well, I suppose I can show you around a bit. The weather is a bit ghastly today, mind you, so many of the children will be about. We usually have them outside quite a bit.”</p><p>“In this frigid weather?”</p><p>The woman looked at Hermione with surprise. “Well, they have got to get their exercise, haven’t they? Can’t have them all lazing about. Come, this way.”</p><p>Hermione stood and followed the woman out through the hallway. She took her into a large hall with black and white tiled floors, lined with cot-like beds. There were nearly a hundred beds, all lined together in the large room.</p><p>Hermione blinked. She had assumed that perhaps the children all had their own rooms, or even shared rooms, but this had all the clinical coldness of a hospital wing. Even so, the Hogwart’s hospital wing was much more welcoming than this. </p><p>“Do the children not have their own bedrooms?” asked Hermione.</p><p>“Oh, goodness no,” the woman uttered, aghast. “How ever would we be able to keep an eye on them after nightfall?”</p><p>“Well, it is a bit run down, but at least it's clean.” She looked around. “Spotless, actually.”</p><p>“Oh, yes, we have the children cleaning for hours, Miss. Should you consider adopting, you will have no problem training them to keep things tidy. Another of our workers, Miss Madeline, drills them with the old adage that <em> cleanliness </em> is next to godliness.”</p><p>Hermione approached one of the beds and her heart lurched in her chest. She saw the double turning of the sheets, the sharp corner of the folds, the precise way that the fittings were tucked. It reminded her so much of the way that Tom made his bed. Hermione couldn’t pinpoint exactly the way it made her feel.</p><p>She turned back to Mrs. Cole. “Where are the children?”</p><p>“They are currently in the dining hall.”</p><p>“What are they fed here?”</p><p>The woman seemed confused by her questions. “I believe today it’s a stew.”</p><p>“And are they fed three square meals a day?”</p><p>“Usually. Provided they behave.”</p><p>Hermione didn’t believe the woman was telling the truth. She thought of Dumbledore and the time he’d come here to talk to Mrs. Cole about Riddle. He’d described the place as a decent place for children to grow up, but she suspected that Mrs. Cole was not quite truthful with Albus.</p><p>She gazed around herself. She’d known he had grown up in a place like this, but seeing it for herself drove it home, like a stake in her heart. He never had the security and love of a parent. He had no one he could trust or turn to. He had no home or even a bedroom to call his own. No wonder he’d stolen from the other children. It’s not as if his upbringing was exactly normal. She recalled Harry saying that according to the matron, Riddle hardly cried as an infant. She’d never seen him shed tears, herself. She wondered if he was capable of that kind of emotion. </p><p>Something stirred in Hermione.</p><p>“Christmas is coming. Will the children have any gifts?”</p><p>Mrs. Cole made a face. “Well, some years we try to. But this year, we’ve lost a few of the orphanage supporters. It’s food and provisions that we focus our funds for, not extras.”</p><p>“I see.”</p><p>The matron proceeded to bring Hermione through the rest of the orphanage. Hermione finally laid eyes on the children, and while they were clean, their clothes were shabby and threadbare. </p><p>“I think I’ve seen enough,” said Hermione quietly. “Please see me back to your office for a moment.”</p><p>The matron complied and once they were seated back in the drafty office, Hermione fixed her with a stern stare. “I would like to become a benefactor of this orphanage.”</p><p>“Oh,” said the woman, surprise etching her features. Hermione couldn’t be sure, but she almost detected a hint of excitement. “To what do we owe your generosity?”</p><p>“That’s none of your concern. I am prepared to give a hefty sum of money, but I am going to be very, very particular about how it is used. I will have my financial overseer distribute the funds, but they will be allocated in the manner in which I dictate. I want new winter clothing purchased for the children, as well as Christmas presents. I want proper food, and sweets given after meal times. I will also set aside a sum of money for the salary of a new employee who is to see to the children’s emotional and physical well-being. This individual will oversee the day to day operations of the orphanage and ensure that the children are properly cared for.”</p><p>Mrs. Cole’s eyebrows drew forward sharply and she sputtered, “You can’t just come here and make demands! You are not on the board of this orphanage. It is my job specifically to oversee the day to day and to allocate the funds as I see fit.”</p><p>“Those are my terms, Mrs. Cole. You may accept them, or not. But I will not give one thing to the orphanage unless I have direct involvement with the use of the funds.”</p><p>Mrs. Cole pursed her lips angrily. “Just how much money are we talking about, <em> Miss </em>Granger?”</p><p>Hermione withdrew a pen and a piece of parchment from her trench coat and proceeded to pen a figure onto the paper. She slid the parchment across the table. </p><p>Mrs. Cole slid her spectacles onto the bridge of her nose as she looked at the paper. Then, her eyes widened. She flicked her gaze back to Hermione as her mouth fell open. “This is an unheard of sum, Miss Granger. Is there a reason you feel it necessary to donate this obscene amount?”</p><p>Hermione looked back at her hollowly. “As I said, my reasons are my own, and not a farthing will be released until I have a signed and notarized legal document detailing my terms.”</p><p>Mrs. Cole stared at the amount written on the parchment, then she took a deep breath. “Well, this would more than provide for all of those things, Miss. I suppose on behalf of the children, I must agree to your request, especially given that we have lost some donors recently.”</p><p>Hermione nodded and gave her a tight smile. “Good. I’m glad to hear it. I will put you in contact with my lawyer, Mr. Silvanox. He will relay all of the details to you, as well as have the contract drawn up and sent to this address. I will choose the worker who will be hired. I’ll be back before Christmas to see that my wishes are being followed.”</p><p>Mrs. Cole nodded sharply and thanked her, and watched incredulously as the young woman made her way back down the staircase. </p><p>Once Hermione was outside in the elements, which truthfully wasn’t much colder than the orphanage itself, her energy waned dramatically. Her knees seemed to buckle from under her, and she sat on the orphanage steps beneath the cover of her umbrella, gazing out at the bleak view which Tom Riddle must have seen nearly every day of his young life. No wonder he hadn’t wanted to leave Hogwarts during the summers.</p><p>A sob rose from her chest to her throat, and Hermione hung her head and cried bitterly.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>That evening, Hermione apparated directly into Tom’s flat. She still wore her pert little skirt suit and pumps, over which she wore a trench coat. Her curls were pulled back into an elegant chignon and she wore a fashionable little hat, with a net covering one eye. </p><p>She turned her head and found Riddle sitting in his armchair, a book in hand and a cigarette in the other, one ankle crossed over his knee. He flicked his gaze over her and pressed his tongue against his cheek.</p><p>“Welcome home, little witch,” he murmured, before he took a long drag from his cigarette. “Come here.”</p><p>She smiled demurely and crossed the room to stand before him. She took off her chameleon skin gloves and tossed them aside, followed by her trench coat and hat, which she unpinned from her hair gingerly. Then she carefully stepped out of her pumps and then slid onto his lap.</p><p>He dropped his finished cigarette into the ashtray before snaking his arms around her waist, pulling her tightly against him.</p><p>Hermione said nothing, but leaned in and pressed her lips to his, her heart melting like snow beneath the heat of his mouth. </p><p>The kiss wasn’t sweet for long. He sucked in a sharp breath through his nose and angled his head, slipping his tongue inside her mouth as his hand slid into her curls, gripping them tightly. He roughly yanked her head back and his lips sought her throat, his tongue swiping along her skin, blazing a hot, wet trail along the outline of her jugular.</p><p>He moved to shove her little cropped jacket off her shoulders. “Too many fucking clothes,” he said in irritation.</p><p>She laughed softly. “Wait, Tom.”</p><p>His jaw tensed as he relented, his hands dropping away as he allowed her to stand and slowly strip. The black pools of his eyes were like hot liquid as he watched her, his gaze flicking back and forth from her face to her hands as they slowly unbuttoned her shirt. His breath caught as she finally stood before him in naught but her frilly French lingerie. </p><p>His eyes were lit with black fire as they met hers.</p><p>Hermione smiled impishly and walked forward, her movements smooth and sensual. She knelt before him, and he cocked an eyebrow as he stared down at her.</p><p>She bit her lip and reached for his belt buckle, slowly unbuckling it as the metal clinked forebodingly. </p><p>He ran his tongue over his top teeth, clearly fighting back a smirk.</p><p>Tom leaned back as he watched her unbutton and unzip his trousers. His cock sprang free. Hermione’s eyes widened at the sight of it; he was fully erect and hard. Having him so close and in her face was intimidating.</p><p>She cocked an eyebrow at him, and he grinned, then winked at her, causing her heart to flutter.</p><p>She’d only done this a couple of times, and always under his guidance and control. She’d never initiated oral sex with him before. He watched her with both amusement and anticipation, as if her actions had surprised him. Truthfully, that’s what she had hoped to do, and although she was a bit nervous, she hid it well.</p><p>She rubbed her lips together, then slid her fingertips with her long nails gently along his shaft. His eyelids fell shut and he leaned his head back.</p><p>Without his eyes directly on her, she felt more free to explore. She leaned down and dragged her tongue along the thick vein on the underside of his length, then swirled her tongue around the tip. She braved a glance at him, and his eyes were slits as he gazed down at her, lips parted. He seemed absolutely enamored of her, caught in her spell, frozen as if in a trance.</p><p>Hermione’s lips trembled as they parted and she took him into her mouth. He inhaled sharply, and she heard his breathing grow tremulous and loud. She kept her eyes on his as she focused on the sensation of his hardness wrapped in warm, silken skin. She flexed her tongue underneath him as his head hit the back of her throat.</p><p>His obsidian eyes roamed her face as she slowly slid her lips up and down his length. His face was expressionless as he watched her, but his pupils were blown wide and his chest rose and fell with each shallow breath. She could sense his muscles constricting and tightening with each movement, and she found that she enjoyed controlling his pleasure for once.</p><p>His bottom lips curled inward and he swiped his tongue over it. “Fuck,” he breathed. “Fuck, Hermione.” He swallowed, and his adam’s apple bobbed attractively, the cords of his throat straining with the building tension in his body.</p><p>She teased him with her tongue and her lips. The last time she’d done this, he had controlled the entire experience, holding her head and thrusting himself down her throat, causing her to choke on his length. It wasn’t an unpleasant experience, as Hermione enjoyed when he took the reins. She even enjoyed his violent tendencies, as it sometimes seemed as if his passion had no outlet but violence.</p><p>But this experience was different. He was restrained, handing over control to her, and she found that she enjoyed this, too. She realized that every time with him was different and unique. It never felt boring or formulaic, but their lovemaking was a fluid thing, an energy as alive as their soul connection, always growing and ever changing. Perhaps he had recognized that she was inexperienced in the beginning of their relationship, and pushed her to her limits while holding tight to the reins of his control. But now, he longed to watch her, to experience her stepping into her own power, and to Hermione, it seemed as if he enjoyed seeing this side of her.</p><p>He reached his hand out and brushed a stray curl from her face, then dragged his knuckles across her cheek as she took him deep into her mouth. “That’s it, that’s my good witch,” he muttered hoarsely. “You look so pretty with your lips wrapped around my cock.”</p><p>Her cheeks pinked beneath his approval and admiration. His words seemed to affect her more than anything.</p><p>He threaded his fingers into her hair, but let them rest there gently, not forcefully. “Perfect,” he breathed tightly. “You’re perfect, Hermione. You’re everything that I want.”</p><p>Hermione suddenly felt a lump in her throat. Those rows of cot-like beds flashed before her eyes, the gloomy and dilapidated orphanage, the threadbare clothing, and she felt the chill of the damp air ghost her skin. Tears rose to her eyes and brimmed over, spilling down her cheeks before she had a chance to stop them. </p><p>Tom watched her, but he said nothing. Gently, he began to guide her mouth down over his cock, and Hermione could taste the salt of her tears as they ran down her cheeks and coated him. She sniffled, her hands trembling as she wrapped her fingers around his base and pumped him in synchrony. “Fuck,” he muttered. “Your tears make me weak, little witch.” </p><p>Suddenly, she felt him growing harder, and he held her head firmly still as he began to thrust several times over her tongue, his tip stroking the back of her throat as he came close to finishing. </p><p>She flicked her watery eyes up at him, and moaned as he fucked her mouth, her voice reverberating around him with seductive vibrations. He shook his head as he looked down at her, then his eyes rolled back as he closed them and he thrust one final time before his cock began to throb, spilling his seed down her throat. The back of her throat convulsed as she attempted to swallow it all, choking somewhat before he eased back. She swallowed once more and then breathed in through her nose deeply, trying to catch her breath. </p><p>He pulled away, then sat panting heavily as he stared down at her. A moment later, he sat forward and pulled her against him as she knelt between his legs. He laid his palm against her face and tilted her head back so that her gaze met his. “Hermione, what’s wrong? What did I say?”</p><p>She shook her head, too choked up to speak. His brows furrowed in confusion as he looked at her seriously, watching as the tears seemed to fall in a flood. After a moment, he wrapped his arms around her and pulled her against his chest.</p><p>“Hermione,” he said, a concerned edge in his tone. “Darling, what’s wrong?”</p><p>“I’m just sorry,” she sobbed. “I’m so sorry you had to grow up the way you did… in that <em> horrid </em>orphanage.”</p><p>Tom blinked several times. He said nothing for a space, but then he slowly pulled away from her and gripped her shoulders. “That isn’t your burden to bear, Hermione. I never asked for your pity.”</p><p>She shook her head, swiping at the tears with her fingers. “I don’t pity you, I…”  She cut herself off before she said something she didn’t want to say.</p><p>Tom pressed his tongue against his cheek as he stared at her. He was still as a statue for several moments before he leaned down and kissed her. He kissed her slowly, savoring the taste of her salty tears and sweet lips. When at last he broke away, he whispered, “I’ve never met anyone like you, Hermione. Truth be told, I don’t think I deserve you.”</p><p>She sniffed and tried to curb the tears. “Did you ever talk try to talk to Dumbledore, Tom? Did you ever really… have a conversation with him?”</p><p>Tom’s jaw tensed, then cocked to the side. He looked down, then flicked his eyes back to her. “I don’t think Dumbledore ever wanted to talk to me, Hermione.”</p><p>She gazed at him through her tears. Their eyes locked and she reached out and stroked his sculpted cheek. “I think, perhaps, you remind him of someone, Tom. And that causes him pain.”</p><p>Tom gazed at her coldly, his jaw muscles taut. “Whatever it may have been, it does not matter. I don’t need Dumbledore and I never have.”</p><p>At that, he stood, pulling her with him. He slid his arms around her waist and leaned his forehead against hers for a moment before breaking away. He made his way into the kitchen and came back producing a goblet filled with wine. </p><p>“Drink it,” he murmured with a smirk, his black eyes glittering. “It’s your turn, little witch.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>A few days later, Tom made his way down a street in a muggle section of London. He entered the quaint little cafe where he often met Wilhelmina Tuft. She had requested a meeting and while Tom had quite a few other things pressing on his mind, he had acquiesced. </p><p>He caught sight of her sitting at their usual table, so he crossed the cafe and loudly yanked out a chair and took a seat, immediately reaching into his coat for his cigarette case. </p><p>“Oh, there’s no need for that, Tom, dear,” she murmured. “This won’t take long.”</p><p>Despite her assurances, he continued to pull a cigarette out and lit it. As he expelled the smoke from his lungs, he looked at her blankly. “What can I do for you today, Mrs. Tuft?”</p><p>Her eyebrows lifted. “Still Mrs. Tuft, and not Minister?”</p><p>He smirked. “No matter what title you hold, to me you’ll always be that wealthy heiress who offered herself to me in my grim flat with the leaky ceiling. Besides, when I say Mrs... it’s only to remind you that you <em>are</em> a married woman.” He slipped the cigarette between his lips and inhaled sharply. As he released the smoke from his mouth and nose, he muttered, “How did it feel to be rejected by an orphaned shopboy of little importance?”</p><p>Wilhelmina blinked, and looked down at her hands with a demure smile. “You downplay yourself, Mr. Riddle. I wish I knew what your game was, but alas, you never cease to surprise me, both in your crassness, your brutal honesty, <em> and </em>your choice of lover.” She reached into her purse and produced a photograph. She laid it on the table and slid it toward him. </p><p>Tom’s eyes flicked down to it, then back up. He took another drag. “What about it?”</p><p>She gazed at him, her eyes shining with some supposed victory. “I find it strange for you to be fucking the very woman who professes to hate you so much. Indeed, she even taunts you in her column. I suspected you of some level of toxicity, but this is shocking, even to me.” She smiled. “Is she a part of your little organization, then?”</p><p>His jaw tensed. “I’ve told you, Tuft. She has nothing to do with any of my dealings.”</p><p>“That’s surprising, considering what she’s written in her column about a certain gang of dark wizards.”</p><p>“I've said before, that is one reason that we have not gone public.” His eyes narrowed as he glared at her. “She does not agree with our views.”</p><p>“Clearly,” she muttered disdainfully. She flicked her eyes to the photograph, and then back to Tom. “You know that I’ve got to do <em>something</em> about her writings in the<em> Prophet</em>.”</p><p>“I know nothing of the sort.”</p><p>Her voice grew sharp. “I don’t <em> care </em>who you’re fucking, Riddle. She is a problem, and it must be addressed.”</p><p>The corners of his lips turned up mockingly. “Is this your pathetic jealousy, Wilhelmina?”</p><p>Her eyebrows lifted sharply. “Do you think me so unprofessional, Tom? Do I seem like some love-addled twit with a broken heart?” She laughed. “I have goals for my term in office, Tom, and I intend to use my time to the fullest advantage. Your little girlfriend is not only undermining you, but she’s casting a negative light on my image. Already, Brits are questioning the efficacy of my administration. You have clearly not dealt with her, and so perhaps you’re the one thinking with your heart and not your head.”</p><p>Tom smirked. “I already have a plan in place to deal with this <em>minor</em> issue, which you seem to be blowing out of bloody proportion.”</p><p>“I’m not stupid, Riddle, so don’t treat me as such. You downplay yourself on purpose, and now you downplay her. You once told me that you considered her to be a force in her own right, and I know that’s how you truly see her. You know as well as I do that she is no <em> minor </em> issue. She is very popular, and very influential, and she will become <em> more </em>influential if someone does not do something to undercut her reputation.”</p><p>Tom’s eyes were hard as he stared at her. “As I’ve just stated, I already have a plan in place.”</p><p>“Good,” she breathed, her usually warm expression twisted with cold rage. “Because if you don’t take care of it, I will, and you, unfortunately, may find yourself wrapped up in it, because I will send this photograph to the gossip tabloids and Britain will have a field day knowing that Hermione Dumbledore has been lying to them for months.”</p><p>Tom’s features were blank as he watched her. He lifted his cigarette to his lips and sucked in the smoke. Then, he blew the smoke into her face as he muttered, “It will be dealt with, Mrs. Tuft.”</p><p>She said nothing more, but snatched up the photograph and walked away, her heels clicking on the floors as she left. </p><p>Tom sat gazing at the spot on the table where the photo had lain. He flicked the ash from his cigarette into the ashtray in the center of the table.</p><p>Several moments passed, before he stood. He gazed out through the window of the cafe, remembering one of their first meetings and the vague impression he’d had that he would be the one to kill that woman. Now, here he was, months later, and he thought to himself quite decisively that it was time for Wilhelmina Tuft to die.</p>

<h2 class="heading">A Carefree Christmas</h2>
</div>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>There were only a few days left until Christmas. Hermione strode through Diagon Alley, drinking in the sight of the twinkling lights and the festive greenery. Witches and wizards lined the streets in their holiday colors, crowding the cobblestone walkways as they shopped for last minute gifts. Hermione hadn’t gotten far - she was being stopped every few feet by passersby who recognized her and couldn’t resist shaking the hand of the famous Hermione Dumbledore.</p><p>“I love your articles!”</p><p>“My daughter was so excited to be sorted into Gryffindor, just like you! <em> Oh </em> , well, <em> and </em> your father, of course!”</p><p>“Congratulations on the opening of Midas Bank! I’ve already moved my galleons over - brilliant work!”</p><p>She appreciated the kind words and warm smiles, but genuinely needed to run some errands and was now wishing that she’d worn the invisibility cloak or even polyjuiced herself for the day.</p><p>After an hour of handshakes and autographs, she’d had enough. She apparated to Vertic Alley, which was slightly less crowded, and dropped into the jewelry shop to pick up a gift she’d commissioned to be custom made for Tom. After catching her breath for a few moments, she apparated to Kettel Court and made a withdrawal at Midas Bank, then browsed the shops there, searching for gifts for her friends, Piksy, Lucky, Eulessia, Septimus, and Cedrella. She even picked up a gift for little Bilius. </p><p>Hermione was having a rather difficult time choosing a gift for Albus. She was very particular about her gift shopping. She wanted whatever she chose to be special and thoughtful. </p><p>After a day of browsing, she was struck by a bolt of inspiration. She apparated away to Hogsmeade where she stopped into Gladrag’s Wizardwear and put in an order for a set of custom-tailored wizarding robes in deep crimson velvet, edged with an ornate gold filigree embroidery. They would be perfect for Albus, and in Gryffindor colors, no less. Then she popped into Dogweed and Deathcap, an herbology shop, where she chose an array of rare herbs which she knew Cedrella Weasley would love for her garden. Then she visited Tomes and Scrolls, Madam Puddifoot’s Tea Shop, and Honeydukes to pick up some remaining items. Lastly, she stopped into The Three Broomsticks for a butterbeer, since it had been some months since she’d had one. From the first sip, she was hit with a wave of nostalgia, as it reminded her of the days of the weekend Hogsmeade visits in which Harry would tag along with Ron and herself under cover of the invisibility cloak. She missed those days, and she missed Ron and Harry terribly. She wondered what they were doing now, and if her being here in 1948 had changed anything in their lives. If so, how? Would they wake up one morning to find their reality permanently altered? Would they even be cognizant of the change? Would they someday wake up and forget that someone named Hermione had ever existed in their world?</p><p>The thought plagued Hermione, but she comforted herself with the notion that she could somehow make things better for them. Perhaps, she already had. </p><p>Her thoughts drifted to Tom. She couldn’t tell if she sensed a change within him, or if she was simply being blinded by her feelings. </p><p>He was a master manipulator, after all. Hermione had to keep reminding herself of that. </p><p>She lived with a deep-seated fear that she would be somehow fooled by him and she would miss her opportunity to destroy the world’s most evil dark wizard. She turned his ring around her finger. She could destroy it… she needed only to kill the basilisk and take one of its fangs. </p><p>Whenever she thought of destroying a piece of his soul, thoughts of the orphanage flashed through her mind. She heard Tom’s whispers.</p><p>
<em> You’re everything that I want. </em>
</p><p>Hermione swallowed. </p><p>She drained the last of her butterbeer and stood to leave. </p><p>“Hermione?”</p><p>She looked up to find Gaspard Dufresne standing in the doorway of the pub, blocking her exit. </p><p>“Gaspard! Good morning…”</p><p>He dipped his head. “Good morning.” He took in her appearance, her fur cloak, cheeks and nose red from the cold and skin flushed from walking all morning. “Christmas shopping?”</p><p>She nodded, her lips turning up in a small smile. “Yes! It’s the perfect day for it. You?”</p><p>He cleared his throat. “No, just a small meeting… in the back.” He gestured to the Three Broomsticks’ private room. Hermione recalled that oftentimes ministry officials would meet there.</p><p>She nodded. “I see.”</p><p>A few moments passed in awkward silence, then he waved his hand and muttered, “You look… well.”</p><p>Her lips parted and she fought a smile. “As do you, Mr. Dufresne.”</p><p>He put his hands in his pockets and nodded, looking quite uncomfortable, though she couldn’t fathom why.</p><p>Hermione cleared her throat. “Well, I must-”</p><p>“Do you plan to attend the New Year’s Eve ball?”</p><p>Her eyebrows lifted. “Er- the one at Tuft Manor?”</p><p>He nodded, his crystalline blue eyes seeming to penetrate through her very flesh and bone. </p><p>“I- No, I don’t believe I shall attend.”</p><p>His brows furrowed minutely. “I assumed that you would.”</p><p>“I don’t know, yet.” She swallowed. “I don’t know that I’ve received an invitation. After my interview with the Minister, I don’t believe we are on the best of terms.”</p><p>His eyes narrowed. “Is that right?”</p><p>“Well, I’m not exactly trying to broadcast it. Besides, I think I’ve attended quite enough balls and galas to last me a lifetime.”</p><p>His jaw tensed as he nodded. “I see. They aren’t my cup of tea either, but I’m required to attend, unfortunately.” He took a deep breath. “Well, I must get to my meeting.”</p><p>“Yes, of course. I still have shopping to do.” Their eyes met, but his were veiled. She’d never met a more difficult wizard to read. Not even Tom himself was so mystifying.</p><p>“Do be careful, Hermione. And have a wonderful Christmas.” He extended his hand.</p><p>She gave him a hint of a smile and a nod, and took his hand. However, instead of shaking it, he turned it over and lifted it to his lips, placing a kiss on the leather of her glove. Then his eyes flicked to hers, and her breath caught. She caught a hint of something within them that sent a shiver down her spine.</p><p>In a split second, he was gone, making his way toward the back room of the pub.</p><p>Hermione’s eyebrows knit in confusion, but she didn’t allow herself to dwell on his strange behavior. She was too filled with the Christmas spirit and felt more lighthearted than she had in months.</p><p>She apparated to Carkitt Market to retrieve her last gift from the Magical Travel Agency.<br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p><br/>
Gaspard entered the back room of the Three Broomsticks to find Albus Dumbledore waiting for him. </p><p>“Good day, Albus.” He greeted his friend and old transfiguration professor with a smile that was extremely rare for Gaspard. They embraced briefly and took their seats in a set of armchairs before the fireplace. </p><p>“I just happened to see Hermione. She was leaving the pub just now.”</p><p>“What a coincidence!” Dumbledore said jovially. “I suppose she is doing some last minute shopping.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Albus cast a side glance at his auror friend, gazing at him through his spectacles. Gaspard sat observing the flames in the fireplace.</p><p>“Well,” said Dumbledore casually as he reclined back with both of his arms placed on the armrests of his chair. “What is new, my friend?”</p><p>Gaspard’s sharp blue eyes met Dumbledore’s. Their eyes were quite similar in color, and were equally as keen in their ability to see through bullshit.</p><p>The auror swallowed, then took a deep breath. </p><p>Dumbledore chuckled. “Why do you seem as if the weight of the world were suddenly dropped upon your shoulders, Dufresne?”</p><p>“No, it’s nothing. Although I did ask for this meeting so that I could run a few things by you.”</p><p>“Please do. I’m at your disposal, and there are very few individuals whom I will say those words to.”</p><p>“The minister has asked me to keep tabs on an individual by the name of Riddle. I’m sure he was a student of yours.”</p><p>Dumbledore nodded in a relaxed manner, but his eyes appeared suddenly sharper.</p><p>“This young man is a sort of protege of Tuft’s. However… One of my aurors captured a photograph of your daughter at his flat. It is a very compromising photograph and it has found its way into the Minister’s hands… without my approval, mind you.”</p><p>Dumbledore sat very still and watchful, listening.</p><p>Gaspard’s jaw tensed. “Are you aware of a relationship between Riddle and Hermione?”</p><p>Dumbledore blinked. His eyes met Gaspard’s, and he gave a slight nod.</p><p>Gaspard looked back to the flames in the fireplace. “Hermione mentioned to me today that she fears that she and the Minister are not on the best of terms. That only confirms to me what I’ve heard myself around the Ministry.”</p><p>Dumbledore stroked his beard thoughtfully. “I suspect that is not all that you have to tell me, Gaspard.”</p><p>Gaspard took a deep breath. “No.” </p><p>The barkeep entered the room and set a glass of peach brandy beside Albus and handed a glass of Ogden’s Old to Dufresne. </p><p>Dufresne nodded his thanks and took a sip. Then he reached into his robes and produced a black and gold cigar case, which he extended to Dumbledore. “Just picked them up from the Tobacconist. Fresh import.”</p><p>Dumbledore chuckled and selected a cigar. “I suppose I’m finally old enough to be having a drink and smoking a cigar with a former student.” He conjured a flame wandlessly and lit the wizard’s cigar and puffed deeply, then watched as the green smoke issued forth. “Best enchanted tobacco I‘ve had in a minute. Of course, I quit smoking them years ago.” He took another puff and blew a smoke ring. “I do like to enjoy them every now and again. These are very good.”</p><p>Gaspard gave a muted smile. “The best galleons can buy.”</p><p>The two wizards smoked in silence for a stretch of time, reveling in the quiet, and the flames, and the peaceable company.</p><p>Gaspard cleared his throat. “I have reason to suspect Riddle is dabbling in the dark arts… in dangerous, ritualistic magic. In fact, I believe he is connected with the dark wizard gang that Hermione has recently uncovered. I can’t prove it, but I believe he may have been the very one who broke into the Magical Museum. Although, admittedly, there’s nothing that leads back to him. No evidence of foul play, nothing to trace back. I cannot conduct any searches or investigative spellwork without a warrant.” He flicked his eyes at Dumbledore. “I believe Hermione may know something. It seems as if she’s trying to tell me something through her articles, but… I fear that she may also be protecting him.”</p><p>Dumbledore nodded. “That may be true.”</p><p>“He is heavily connected with the pureblooded set, though only a half-blood himself. As are you and I, Albus. Do you not find it strange?”</p><p>Dumbledore heaved a deep sigh. “He is of Gaunt blood, Gaspard. The Gaunts are one of the Sacred 28 families. His ancestry traces back with roots to Salazar Slytherin himself and perhaps further. I’ve long had suspicions about Tom Riddle. I suspect the purebloods have overlooked his muggle blood for that reason.”</p><p>“Do you think him dangerous?”</p><p>“Oh, very. I’ve suspected as much since he was a student of mine. Very charming young man… his motives have always been a mystery to me.”</p><p>Dufresne gazed at his old professor. “I hope that Hermione knows what she is doing, Albus. She is creating enemies.”</p><p>Albus puffed on his cigar, then muttered, “Hermione is a smart witch. She is also headstrong… and, unfortunately, very soft-hearted.” He cast a keen glance at Gaspard. “I was once soft-hearted like her, in my youth. But I learned very quickly to quell my emotions. You and I have that in common, Dufresne. She will have to learn this. That is why I want you to watch after her.”</p><p>Gaspard took a drink of his firewhiskey. “If I come across something that can put Riddle away… should I act on it? I ask you as a friend and mentor… and as someone who knows Hermione very well.”</p><p>Dumbledore turned his gaze onto the auror. “You ask me this as if you are concerned about her feelings in the matter.”</p><p>Gaspard said nothing, but stared at the older wizard with penetrating, crystal blue eyes.</p><p>Dumbledore was quiet for several minutes. After a stretch, he replied, “I suppose if Hermione is giving you hints through her articles, then she is hoping you will do something that she does not have the strength to do herself.” He took a sip of his brandy. “To confine Riddle to Azkaban would probably be the best thing for wizardkind.”</p><p>Gaspard became lost in thought as he watched the flames dance and crackle like a pagan bonfire, the kind that could put one in a trance for hours.</p><p>“Dufresne,” Dumbledore said, drawing the younger wizard’s attention.</p><p>Their eyes were like mirrors. </p><p>“If you feel something for her,” said Albus quietly, “I urge you to act upon it, before it’s too late.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Two days before Christmas, Tom Riddle met with Professor Slughorn in one of the spare potions rooms. It had been exactly eighty-eight days since they’d begun brewing the potion, and it was now complete. All he had to do now was add his own tears to the mixture. He’d come up against some difficulty in producing tears. He’d tried the laughing draught, and had not been successful in forming tears, although his abdominal muscles were quite sore following a bout of extreme laughter that lasted many hours and he chastised himself for his lack of proper exercise. He determined that he would put himself on an exercise regimen from that point on.</p><p>He’d also attempted the method of onion chopping, which caused him to experience an intense burning sensation in his eyes, but no tears, unfortunately. </p><p>His last trick worked, but caused him a great deal of discomfort. He procured a few African Red Devil Peppers from The Magic Neep and proceeded to eat them all, one by one. First, he began to sweat profusely. Then, his ears practically smoked, and his mouth burned with a heat so blistering, he swore he could breathe dragon fire. </p><p>Then, the tears began to flow. It brought Tom some measure of relief, because he had long feared that perhaps his tear ducts were broken. The orphanage matrons had often teased him that there was something wrong with him (“What infant doesn’t cry? Never seen such a peculiar thing!”) but apparently, he just wasn’t the weeping kind. </p><p>Tom produced the vial of tears. He and Slughorn gazed into the glowing, pearlescent potion as it swirled on its own, like a magical whirlpool. It was one of the most beautiful potions Tom had ever brewed.</p><p>“Well, boy, looks as if we’ve brewed it correctly. Not that I had any doubt, with the two of our brilliant potioneering minds put together. Still, this is a momentous occasion. I’ve never brewed the potion, nor heard of anyone in my time brewing it. It is a rather archaic recipe, rare to even hear of it these days.”</p><p>Tom was suddenly struck with a thought. What if the potion turned red? </p><p>He stared at the milky vortex of the brew. He decided that it did not matter. If it turned out that Hermione was not, in fact, his soulmate, then it changed very little for Tom. Their magic would remain unaffected in all likelihood, but Tom would still attempt the soul bond, just the same. He knew that Hermione was connected to him somehow, mind, body, and soul, regardless of the outcome of some silly and outdated potion. </p><p>Tom grabbed the vial and held it aloft. “Here goes nothing, Professor.”</p><p>He uncorked the vial and tipped it into the cauldron.</p><p>For several moments, the potion remained the same, a lustrous, iridescent swirling of a pale and foamy liquid. Tom and Horace stared into the cauldron, eyes narrowed and brows knit in concentration.</p><p>Then, the brew began to shift direction and spin counterclockwise. Tom flicked his eyes to Slughorn, who appeared just as fascinated by the outcome as Tom himself.</p><p>Then, the brew began to bubble. Suddenly, a bright flash of color spread through the eddying draught, saturating its opalescent consistency.</p><p>Tom’s lips parted, and Slughorn’s eyes grew wide. </p><p>“How now, my boy! I suppose this is a call for a celebration! Not only to have successfully brewed the potion, but to have a real and true confirmation of a <em> legitimate </em> soulmate connection! It is an academic anomaly, Tom. I know <em> precisely </em> the bottle of elf-made wine to crack open!”</p><p>Tom glanced up at Slughorn, his handsome face lit up blue by the bright glow of the potion. His lips pulled back, spreading into a wide grin.</p><p>Slughorn ran off and returned from his office with a vintage bottle of 1892 aged wine. He levitated the bottle and it filled two goblets to the brim with dark liquid.</p><p>He clapped Riddle on the back, who still stood staring dumbfoundedly at the potion, a stupid grin painting his sculpted features. “So when’s the wedding my boy? And when am I going to find out who this lucky witch is?”</p><p>He handed Tom a goblet and they both held them high.</p><p>“You’ll be the first to know, Professor,” Tom murmured with a grin. “Cheers.”</p><p>They both drank deeply, and Tom couldn’t stop the sense of elation that spread through his body, a warm and euphoric feeling. His heart beat swiftly as he realized that he was one step closer to completing the soul bond. </p><p>Now, he only needed to locate the Thread of Fate.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Hermione had breakfast with Piksy on Christmas Eve morning, and then spent the day with Septimus and Cedrella Weasley and several of their relatives. The Weasley clan had seemed rather surprised and impressed by Septimus and Cedrella’s close friendship with Dumbledore’s famous daughter, and Hermione smiled to herself as she mused that they truly had no idea how closely linked she truly was to the Weasley family, in this life and her past one. </p><p>That night, she and Tom drank hot cider as they sat entangled before the fire. Hermione reclined against his chest, his arms wrapped around her. He’d been especially busy at work in the past few weeks leading up to Christmas, working overtime and barely getting his usual days off due to the holiday season. Despite the extra workload, he seemed to have raked in a small fortune in commissions over the holiday season, which his employers both celebrated and grumbled about.</p><p>“What will you do tomorrow, little witch?” he murmured against her hair.</p><p>“Hmm,” she hummed. “Spend the day with Dumbledore. He wants to introduce me to his brother.”</p><p>He pressed his nose into her hair, inhaling its scent as he asked, “Did you know Dumbledore in the future?”</p><p>She nodded, but said nothing else.</p><p>“Makes sense,” he breathed.</p><p>“I knew his brother as well,” she whispered. “It will be odd to be re-introduced.”</p><p>He cocked a brow. “I suppose that has something to do with Dumbledore’s aiding you with your cover story, then?”</p><p>Hermione’s heart began to beat more quickly. She always grew nervous when he began to ask too many questions regarding her past, and his future. It was as if he were systematically dismantling her cover and attempting to piece it all together like a puzzle, one innocent question at a time.</p><p>She nodded. </p><p>“Where’s your phoenix, Hermione?”</p><p>“Dumbledore is caring for her. He thought it best to keep her with Fawkes for now. ‘The birds love company,’ he says.”</p><p>Tom laughed under his breath as he stroked her arm softly with his fingertips. “Eccentric old man.”</p><p>“You’re quite eccentric yourself, Riddle.”</p><p>He cocked an eyebrow. “You never call me that.”</p><p>She giggled deviously. “Only when I want to sharpen an insult.”</p><p>He snorted. “Will I see you tomorrow?”</p><p>“Yes,” she breathed. “Tomorrow evening. Like always.”</p><p>“Good. Perhaps, it will be the first Christmas I’ve ever enjoyed.” </p><p>A few moments went by. Hermione took a sip of her cider.</p><p>“Hermione.”</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>“Do you miss your family?”</p><p>Hermione’s breath caught. “Yes. Terribly.”</p><p>He ran his tongue over his top teeth. “Can’t relate.”</p><p>She swallowed thickly. “I know, Tom.”</p><p>“What does it feel like? To be here, away from them.”</p><p>Her lips parted. “I… I don’t know that I could explain it. I suppose it might feel like… if you and I were separated and knew we’d never see one another again. Perhaps it might feel something like that.”</p><p>His brow furrowed pensively. “Did you come here by choice? Or was it accidental?”</p><p>“It was… accidental, Tom.”</p><p>He nodded, his eyes faraway. His fingers played with the horcrux on her finger. It was then that he noticed another ring on the middle finger of her right hand. It was antique gold in color, set with pearls and diamonds. “You’ve never worn this ring, Hermione. Where did you get it?”</p><p>“Oh,” she breathed. “Dumbledore gave it to me, on my birthday.”</p><p>He cocked his head. He took her fingers in his and examined the ring. “This ring is magical.”</p><p>Hermione turned to look back at him. “How do you know?”</p><p>He shook his head. “I… don’t really know. I suppose all my years of working with enchanted items at the shop contributes to it, but I know when an item is enchanted. I can sense a very strong magic upon this ring.”</p><p>Hermione’s eyebrows shot up. “How strange… I hadn’t even noticed. I do think you’re right. Albus didn’t mention anything to me. He said it’s been passed down through his family.”</p><p>“He must see you as his family, Hermione.”</p><p>She swallowed. “I suppose we are, in a sense, the only family either of us have.”</p><p>Tom was quiet. Hermione hadn’t realized that neither she, nor Tom, nor Dumbledore really had any family, aside from Albus’ brother, Aberforth, with whom his relationship was strained at best.</p><p>Hermione wasn’t quite sure when she’d resigned herself to staying here in 1948. She supposed when Dumbledore hadn’t been able to offer her any solutions, and none of the countless books she’d combed on time magic had contained any definitive answers, she had realized that her only option would be to turn to Tom’s knowledge of the time travel object he’d created. But in order for her to obtain that knowledge, she would have to tell Riddle the truth, and while she’d considered lying to him, she realized that he would likely want memories to corroborate her story, and truth be told, she didn’t want to lie to him.</p><p>But she wasn’t quite ready to tell him the truth yet. How could she? When it might possibly destroy any advantage that she had over him? </p><p>Then again, she didn’t believe that he would even help her go back, if he possessed the knowledge. He wanted her here, with him, after all.</p><p>“Was it an object that sent you here?”</p><p>Tom’s voice broke her out of her thoughts. She sighed. “Can we talk about this another time?”</p><p>It was silent for several moments. “Of course. Enough questions for tonight.” </p><p>“For tonight.” She reached up and threaded her fingers with his. “Tom, I never did thank you for helping me… with the elixir. I don’t know if I could’ve broken the habit without you. Thank you.”</p><p>He smoothed her hair behind her shoulder with his long fingers, then he kissed her bare shoulder and whispered against her skin, “You’re most welcome, pretty witch.”<br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p>At precisely ten in the morning on Christmas Day, Hermione stood outside of the Hog’s Head Inn in Hogsmeade. Dumbledore had warned Hermione of his brother’s gruff manner and their strained relationship, which was not yet resolved. Hermione was already aware of Aberforth’s prickly demeanor and their family issues. Still, it was comforting to be around people she’d known during her own time, and Hermione had grown to like Aberforth. </p><p>Hermione knocked on the rickety wooden door. It was Albus who answered, garbed in brilliant red and pale green robes, looking very much like an old world Santa Claus. With a brilliant smile, he welcomed Hermione into the inn. The place wasn’t quite as dirty as she remembered it, but that still didn’t mean much, as the place still needed a thorough deep clean. She thought to herself that she might bring Piksy here to help out a bit. Her elf friend was nearly tearing her hair out that there was very little to clean at her flat. Piksy had previously served a wealthy French family with an expansive mansion. That entailed endless cleaning, which, as it happened, was her favorite pastime, and there was very little of that to do at Hermione’s flat, unfortunately.</p><p>Hermione entered the Hog’s Head and passed beneath the solemn and mournful portrait of Ariana as Albus immediately led her to a back room where there was a roaring fireplace. Aberforth stood by awkwardly.</p><p>“Aberforth, I’d like you to meet my daughter, Hermione.”</p><p>Hermione smiled and held out her hand. “Hello, Aberforth. I’ve been so looking forward to meeting you.” </p><p>He wiped his hand on his pants and then took her hand, uttering nothing more than a grunt. </p><p>“Fetch Hermione a cup of cider, if you please, Aberforth.”</p><p>His brother left the room and returned with a platter of breakfast foods and some cups of hot cider. </p><p>Then, Aberforth cleared his throat and muttered gruffly, “I’ve got to go feed my goats… I’ll be back in a bit.”</p><p>Hermione nodded and watched him leave through a side door.</p><p>Once they were alone, Albus spoke. “You did say you knew my brother in the future, correct?” asked Albus.</p><p>“Yes, I did. He helped us a great deal, during the war.”</p><p>Albus nodded thoughtfully. “Hermione, it is entirely up to you how much you would like to reveal. My brother and I have not been on good terms for years, but it does give me hope, what you’ve told me about our relationship in the future. I believe my brother is trustworthy, if you would like to share some of the truth with him. I know it must be a terrible weight on your shoulders, to have to continually hide the truth of who you are. Though, the fewer people who know the truth, the better, I don’t believe anyone would think of my brother as a source of intel.”</p><p>Hermione fiddled with the charms on her bracelet. “I’ve been here almost a year, Albus. I’ve somewhat resigned myself that I may never go back.”</p><p>His expression was thoughtful. “Have you told anyone the truth?”</p><p>Her eyes met his. “You mean… have I told Tom?”</p><p>He was stoically silent.</p><p>Hermione swallowed. “I… haven’t told him the truth, no. But he has deduced some things, on his own.”</p><p>Albus nodded. The fire crackled and sputtered. </p><p>“Do you love him, Hermione?”</p><p>Her mouth fell open, and she suddenly felt as if she couldn’t breathe. Her eyes slid from the flames to Dumbledore’s brilliant blue eyes, and she felt lost in them, as if they were the cool waters of the Aegean, turbulent with the waves of the ancient world. They were both peaceful and archaic, and she felt stilled by them, perhaps even as much as she felt challenged by the portals in Tom’s eyes.</p><p>She released her breath all at once, but before she could answer, Aberforth barrelled into the room with all the grace of a bull in a china shop. He stamped his feet and shook off the cold with a violent shiver.</p><p>“Quite frosty out there,” he huffed. Then he made his way over by the fire and sat down at the heavy wooden table beside Dumbledore. He took up a plate and a fork and gestured to the food. “Well, go on and eat, it’s a late breakfast but a hearty one still.”</p><p>Dumbledore had lost his troubled countenance and once again had taken on a jovial expression. He looked at Hermione with barely concealed amusement and they both decided they’d better eat what Aberforth had prepared.</p><p>Dumbledore mediated the conversation well, and despite his surly attitude, Hermione and Aberforth got on pleasantly. After a few minutes, Hermione nodded at Dumbledore.</p><p>Albus turned to his brother. “Aberforth, I have left the revealing of this secret up to Hermione, but she has informed me that she feels comfortable enough with you to share. I know that you have been… <em> surprised </em>by the sudden appearance of my daughter. It almost mirrors a similar situation which we found ourselves in some years ago.”</p><p>“Don’t tell me.” He held up a hand. “She’s not your daughter. I already suspected as much.”</p><p>Dumbledore looked at him sharply. “Did you now?”</p><p>Aberforth cleared his throat. “Well, for one, you’ve never liked the lasses, Albus. We all know that. Secondly, she’s much too nice of a girl to be related to the likes of you.”</p><p>Albus took a deep breath and cocked an eyebrow. “<em> You </em> are related to me, Aberforth.”</p><p>“Yeah, and do I strike either of you as nice?”</p><p>Hermione inclined her head, her lips twitching as she fought back laughter.</p><p>“So where’ve you come from then, Miss?”</p><p>Hermione cleared her throat. “Well… I’m a time traveler. An… accidental time traveler. I didn’t mean to come back in time. But I’m here now.”</p><p>Aberforth was too stunned to speak. His eyebrows furrowed sharply, and he looked back and forth from Albus to Hermione.</p><p>“Well,” he said brusquely. “Of all the ill-advised, hairbrained escapades my brother’s got himself wrapped up in, this one might take the cake. <em> Barely </em>.” He flicked his eyes at Hermione. “So what year have you come from?”</p><p>Hermione looked at Albus nervously, but he nodded at her to continue. “Nineteen ninety-eight,” she said anxiously.</p><p>Aberforth’s eyebrows shot up. His shock was palpable. “I suppose magic has come a long way then, in all that time.”</p><p>Hermione winced wryly. “Not as much as it <em> should </em>, to be honest.”</p><p>“Aberforth,” Albus cut in, his tone rather serious. “There have been two wars, which Hermione has been a soldier on the forefront of. I have visited her memories and seen much of what will take place, although some things I’ve purposefully left a mystery. To alter events could be catastrophic. However, Hermione and I did know one another in this future time, and according to her, she knew you as well.”</p><p>Hermione nodded quickly. “Oh, yes! You were a great, great help to us in the war, Aberforth. You saved us when we couldn’t save ourselves.”</p><p>Aberforth snorted. “Sounds about right. Always saving the heroes when they run into trouble doing Godric’s work or whatever the hell it is.”</p><p>Albus’ expression was one of labored patience. “Hermione is a war hero, Aberforth, and you must treat her with respect.” Aberforth straightened, and the two brothers locked eyes. “The reason I tell you all of this, Aberforth, is because while Hermione’s presence here is dangerous and also a very huge risk, as time travel is illegal, she has a very good chance of altering future events for the better. I wanted you, at least, to know the truth, particularly because Hermione is a Dumbledore.”</p><p>Aberforth burst out laughing. “Like hell she is.”</p><p>“Aberforth,” Albus said sternly. “She has a phoenix.”</p><p>Aberforth stopped laughing and his gaze cut to Hermione. “She what?”</p><p>“A phoenix came to her, when she was in need of help.”</p><p>Aberforth’s eyes narrowed as he gazed at her. His eyes flicked down to her hands and he caught sight of her ring. “You gave her mother’s ring.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Aberforth ran his hand over the stubble on his chin. “A phoenix?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Well,” he muttered in a gravelly voice. “That’s very interesting, indeed.”</p><p>Hermione looked between the brothers.</p><p>After a stretch of silence, Albus spoke. “I believe, brother, that Hermione was <em> meant </em>to come here. I do not think it was by chance that the idea struck me to present her to the world as my daughter. I believe that she was fated to be a Dumbledore, not by blood, but by magic. Deep, ancient magic.”</p><p>Aberforth sighed. “You and your whimsy, Albus.”</p><p>“You cannot deny that it is peculiar, brother.”</p><p>Aberforth looked at Hermione. “Well, what have you named it?”</p><p>She looked taken aback. “The phoenix?”</p><p>“It’s a female,” Albus interjected. “Quite a beautiful bird.”</p><p>“I- Well,” Hermione said hesitantly. “I thought perhaps the name… Seraphina.”</p><p>It was quiet for several moments, save for the crackling of the flames.</p><p>Albus broke the silence. “A beautiful name, for a magnificent phoenix. May I ask what inspired the name?”</p><p>Hermione swallowed, uncertain how much she should reveal. “Well, a seer once gave me a reading. She spoke of a violent upset in my life, which, as it happens, has come to pass. But she also spoke of a rebirth from the ashes. She called love the fire of life, and asked me whether I would allow it to purify me… or consume me. Since a phoenix is reborn from its ashes... Seraphina in Hebrew means “fiery one” and in French, it means “purifying angel” … I thought it was only fitting.”</p><p>“It’s perfect, Hermione.” Albus lifted his glass. “To Seraphina, and to Hermione, the newest Dumbledore.” </p><p>Aberforth did the same. Once they had each imbibed deeply, Aberforth muttered, “I want to see this phoenix.”</p><p>“And you shall, brother.”</p><p>“Where is it?”</p><p>“Well,” Hermione hedged. “Dumbledore is taking care of her for the time being.”</p><p>“She gets along quite well with Fawkes.”</p><p>“I’m not allowed to have magical creatures in my flat, as per the contract, but I am planning to purchase a property soon.”</p><p>Dumbledore lifted an eyebrow. “Oh?”</p><p>She nodded excitedly. “It’s… it’s an old factory. Portsmouth Potions. It’s abandoned and quite run down, but I had a vision of it restored and I’d like to buy it. I might live there one day, or… who knows? I might turn it into a research facility, or house a program for muggleborns.”</p><p>Dumbledore smiled softly. “You have a brilliant and thoughtful mind, Hermione. You never cease to amaze and impress me, but beyond that… you <em>inspire</em> me.”</p><p>Aberforth looked back and forth between them several times before clearing his throat loudly and standing. “Time for a Dumbledore Christmas tradition. A game of Exploding Snap!”<br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p>Hermione had gifted Albus and Aberforth with a matching set of elegantly carved wooden pipes and bags of veela leaves, and especially for Dumbledore, a new set of ornate, crimson velvet dress robes, and a pair of tickets for the Black Barge. Dumbledore had expressed interest in visiting the Isle of Avalon. In muggle literature, Avalon was a magical island of Arthurian legend, the Isle of Apples. Muggles had searched for the island for hundreds of years, with many theories on where its location could be, and most had assumed it was merely a legend. However, the island was real and was found off the coast of Ireland, although it was hidden from the muggle world by concealment charms, which kept the island shrouded in an enchanted mist. King Arthur's sword <em>excalibur</em> was made there, and the famed witch Morgan le Fay was once the ruler of the island, and over the order of witches who dwelled there.  There were plants which grew there that contained magical properties, and the great castle on the island was full of magical artifacts from the days of King Arthur. Both Arthur and Morgan le Fay were buried there, and Albus had mentioned to Hermione that he would like to visit again, so Hermione had purchased them both tickets for the magical barge, which was the only way to approach the island safely. </p><p>Later that evening, after a hearty holiday meal cooked by Hermione of beef &amp; stout pies and roasted potatoes, Tom and Hermione sat before the roaring fireplace in her flat, and she excitedly gave Tom his presents. </p><p>"I hope I haven't overdone it, but I felt I owed you a few things."</p><p>His brows furrowed as he opened the first gift. She'd ordered him a stack of his custom-tailored Italian shirts in black and white, which were the only colors he ever wore.</p><p>"Since I've commandeered several of them," she said sheepishly. </p><p>He chuckled and proceeded to open the second gift, which was a bottle of his favorite cologne, imported from Spain. </p><p>"Since I know you've run out, and partially because I spray it on my pillows regularly," she murmured.</p><p>He shook his head, calling her a silly witch as he reached for the final present. He opened the ornate box, and on a bed of velvet, there sat a gold pocket watch, engraved with the Slytherin house crest. </p><p>Tom blinked a few times, staring at the watch.</p><p>Hermione looked at him and then back to the pocket watch before asking nervously, "Do you not like it?"</p><p>He reached into the box and lifted it out, turning it over in his hand. "This is solid gold, is it not? This must have been very expensive."</p><p>"Well, yes, but..." She hadn't considered that perhaps he might feel outdone by the gift. Suddenly, she felt very foolish. She knew he preferred to own a few items of quality, judging by his shirts, his serpent-engraved cufflinks, and the other items he kept and took care of painstakingly. His own pocket watch was very plain and made of brass, and she'd wanted to replace it for him. "I'm sorry, I suppose I overdid it."</p><p>"No, no," he muttered quickly. "It's a grand gift, Hermione. I'm just rather in awe, I suppose. It's something I would have purchased for myself."</p><p>"I... <em>tried</em> to give it a fair bit of thought," she replied slowly. </p><p>He reached into his pocket and produced his old brass watch. He held it out into the light, turning it over in his hand. "I've had this one since the orphanage. I stole it, actually. When I was boy."</p><p>Hermione gazed at it, then flicked her eyes back to Tom, listening intently.</p><p>He swallowed, then ran his tongue over his top teeth. "I don't know why I kept it. I suppose it reminds me of where I've come from. Keeps me motivated." He sat it down and took up the new watch, running his thumb over its shiny gold filigree. "But this... this reminds me who I am. The descendent of one of the greatest wizards who ever lived." His jaw tensed and his expression grew bitter. "I'm not sure that it feels as good as it once did. I used to think Slytherin noble, but now I think he must've been terribly misguided."</p><p>Hermione was quiet for several moments, then she said quietly, "Yes, but he was a powerful wizard, Tom. His blood runs in your veins. That is the great thing about being the next generation. We can make improvements; we can build upon the legacy of our ancestors, and then, when necessary, we can change what must be changed, to make the world a better place for the next."</p><p>Tom was silent for a beat as he stared at the watch.</p><p>Then, he turned to Hermione and took her chin between his fingers. "That's all very well and good, Hermione. But you have no magical blood, and yet, you're the most powerful witch I've ever met." He gazed at her intently before lowering his lips to hers. He kissed her softly for only a moment, before leaning back and whispering, "Thank you, little witch. I do love the gift."</p><p>Hermione's heart thumped erratically in her chest, and suddenly she felt her body heating. </p><p><em>This is not the moment to be horny</em>, she chastised herself. Somehow, he always found a way to make her completely lose herself.</p><p>He smirked and then his lips spread into a wide grin. "Now it's time for your gift."</p><p>He crossed the room to where his robes lay over an armchair and withdrew several envelopes and a small velvet drawstring bag. </p><p>He walked back to Hermione and stood before her, holding the envelopes and looking a bit nervous, which was rare for Tom.</p><p>"Do you recall showing me a few months ago the exhaustive spellbook you'd made? The one charmed to be searchable?"</p><p>She nodded, unsure of where this was going.</p><p>"I told you it would be a great idea to have it published and reproduced, but you said no publisher would ever want to publish it."</p><p>Her lips parted slightly and her eyes flicked to the envelopes. "Tom... what did you do?"</p><p>He smirked and held out the envelopes. She noticed the one on the top bore an elaborate seal.</p><p>"I have sent out queries to the top publishing houses in magical Britain. I have here the responses from Obscurus Books, Whizz Hard Books, and Winickus Press."</p><p>"Oh dear god, Tom! Did you really?" Her eyes were wide as saucers as she stared at the envelopes.</p><p>He merely nodded, and handed the envelopes to her. "Open them, Hermione."</p><p>"I think I shall faint of <em>embarrassment!</em> I simply <em>cannot</em> open those."</p><p>Tom heaved a deep breath. "Silly witch. Would you like me to open them?"</p><p>She swallowed and nodded, covering her eyes with her hands.</p><p>He grinned and began breaking the seal on the first. Hermione listened to the rattle of paper as he read the first, and then continued on to the second, then the third.</p><p>He sighed. "Hermione, unfortunately..."</p><p>"Oh, <em>god</em>, Tom," she moaned, dropping her face to her knees and covering her head with her arms.</p><p>"... you're going to have to choose between all three, because they all want to publish you."</p><p>Hermione snapped up, her hands automatically flying over her mouth. "No! You're lying!"</p><p>He chuckled and extended the papers to her. "See for yourself."</p><p>Her eyes flew back and forth across the papers, widening a fraction with every word. "I cannot <em>believe</em> you did this, you sneaky little <em>snake</em>, Riddle!"</p><p>"I am a Slytherin, after all."</p><p>She seemed to regain her composure a bit as she lowered the papers to her lap and adjusted herself, an expression of smugness barely concealed on her face.</p><p>Tom ran his tongue over his incisors. "From dying of embarrassment to preening like a peacock in mere seconds. That's got to be a record."</p><p>"Oh, <em>shut</em> up, will you?" she said with a grin. She bit her lip as she brought the papers back up and read them again.</p><p>After a moment, he cleared his throat, drawing her attention back to him.</p><p>"I have another gift."</p><p>Her eyes widened. "<em>Another?</em>"</p><p>He nodded, his black eyes glittering like faceted obsidian. Tom sat down beside her. “What I’m about to give you is a very rare, one of a kind magical artifact. I’m still astounded at my luck in coming across them.” He placed in her hand a small drawstring bag, sewn of old, faded blue velvet. “In this bag are <em> Urim </em> and <em> Thummim </em>. Do you know what they are?”</p><p>Hermione shook her head, her eyes wide. </p><p>Tom grinned, clearly excited by the gift and the chance to explain its properties. He opened the bag and turned it upside down. Two smooth stones fell out, one black and one white. “<em> Urim </em> and <em> Thummim </em>are seer stones… a very renowned set of oracle stones traced back to ancient jewish lore. The high priests would wear these stones in their breastplate. Some believe that God speaks through these stones, and reveals his will. Others believe that fate will show itself through them. They are connected to cleromancy, which is divination by casting lots.”</p><p>“I know what cleromancy is, Tom,” she said, cutting her eyes at him, but the excitement was obvious in her face.</p><p>“So,” he began as he dropped the stones into her open palm. “Theoretically, one would leave the stones in the bag. You would ask a question, and then draw a stone. The white stone, <em> Urim </em> , represents yes. The black, <em> Thummim </em> , represents no. They can even symbolize innocent or guilty. They are a type of oracle, a way of seeing which is the correct path to take.” He gazed at her face to gauge her reaction. “In any case, regardless of whether they work or not, these <em> are </em>the original stones. I had them checked out by the British Historical Society of Magic.”</p><p>“You mean the Historical Society which you <em> robbed </em>?” she asked innocently, casting him a side eye.</p><p>Tom grinned. “The very one.”</p><p>Hermione laughed. “You're reprehensible, sir.” She turned the stones in her hand, marveling at the rare gift he’d just given her. “But do you not wish to keep these for yourself?”</p><p>He shook his head. “No. You’re meant to have them. I knew it as soon as I laid eyes on them. As it stands, I’m quite a decisive individual, Hermione. Once I make up my mind, I do not hesitate to act and I do not regret a thing. I have a feeling these stones might help you, if they are, in fact, what they’re cracked up to be.”</p><p>“Did you just call me wishy-washy?”</p><p>Tom laughed. “<em>Never</em>, darling. I would never insinuate that you can’t make up your mind to save your life.”</p><p>“Really! <em> Thanks </em>, Tom, for your faith in me.” She rolled her eyes, but she fought back a smile as she rubbed the stones with her fingertips. “This is a marvelous present, Tom. It puts mine to shame, actually. You always get the most thoughtful gifts.” She lifted her eyes to meet his gaze. His black eyes bore into hers, and they seemed to caress her, communicating something between the windows of their souls that made Hermione’s heart beat faster. “Why are you looking at me like that?”</p><p>He didn’t look away. After a moment, he whispered, “Like what?”</p><p>Hermione swallowed and looked away, rubbing her lips together nervously. She slid the two stones back into the bag. “I should cast enchantments on these to protect them.” </p><p>She started to stand to put them away, but he caught her hand. Her lips parted, and she stared at their hands, hers held tightly in his. Why did she suddenly feel so anxious? How many nights had they spent together? And yet, she’d never been so nervous around him as she was now. She flicked her eyes up to his face, and she found him still gazing at her with that same heated, penetrating stare. </p><p>“Hermione,” he said softly.</p><p>She stood abruptly. “I need to put these away,” she muttered, her voice trembling. </p><p>She heard him exhale as she walked away, but she couldn’t stop. She had to do something with her hands; she had to get out of that room where the walls were closing in and his eyes were doing strange things to her stomach.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Later that night, after her hands had stopped shaking and her heart had ceased to pound, she’d busied herself with baking him gingerbread cookies. Against her own will, she’d thought in some sentimental part of her brain that she might make this a Christmas tradition. She always had traditions with her parents, and with the Weasleys, but now she would have to create new ones. She shoved aside the thought that she hoped Tom would be around next Christmas. </p><p>She knew it was highly unlikely. </p><p>And even if he was still in her life a year from now, what of the next? And the next? What would happen when their goals and ideals finally clashed and collided, creating an explosion the size of an atom bomb?</p><p>Hermione shook her head as a lump rose up into her throat, and proceeded to pop the cookies in the oven.</p><p>She’d asked him about his previous Christmases, which he said were typically spent at the orphanage. His last Christmas he had spent with the Malfoys, but he said that he rarely enjoyed the holiday. It was like any other day for Tom; he’d never had anyone to share it with. No family or loved ones. It wasn’t anything special for him. This saddened Hermione, so she once again threw herself into some busy-making task so she didn’t burst into tears. Tom let her flit about, as he seemed to intuit that her emotional state was fragile. It shook Hermione even more that he seemed to be able to read her like a book.</p><p>Later that night, they’d sat on her fur rug in front of her bedroom fireplace, listening to his favorite record. She’d been showing him the books she’d given him when he pulled her in and kissed her so hungrily that she completely forgot her frazzled nerves. She allowed him to press her into the fur rug and make love to her slowly, as he whispered things in her ear that were destructive to her peace of mind. Each promise, each claim of ownership, each word of praise and adoration felt like the piercing of another arrow into her heart.</p><p>He always knew just what to say to make her feel as if she were coming apart at the seams.</p><p>He braced himself above her afterward on trembling arms, his inky black curls falling over his forehead as he gazed at her. Their chests heaved in the aftermath; she didn’t speak and neither did he, but they didn’t have to. There was an unspoken truth hanging in the space between them, both hidden and obvious. If either of them spoke it, it would become visible, so they were each unwilling to name it, to say the words that rose up within them, words too terrifying to utter out loud.</p><p>Later, Hermione lay in bed attempting to sleep, but her heart wouldn’t stop racing. She laid on her side and he held her, his chest pressed against her back and his arms tightly wound around her middle. Hermione reveled in the heat of his body and the soft rising and falling of his chest as he slept. His breathing was gentle and even, and it tickled her ear.</p><p>As her eyes slowly drifted shut, and she was sure that he was sleeping soundly against her, she whispered softly, “I love you, Tom Riddle.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Hermione and Tom awoke on New Year’s Eve in Tom’s flat, their limbs entangled. Tom’s employer had attempted to make him work (said he’d taken off too much time recently) but Tom simply refused to go in, and since the sheisty Borgin couldn’t actually fire Tom (he made the shop too much gold), he acquiesced to letting him have the day off for his birthday. The Daily Prophet had already finished printing their issues for the next two days and so Tom and Hermione effectively had the next two days off.</p><p>Hermione lay with her head on Tom’s chest, still half asleep.</p><p>Tom stroked the bare skin of her back softly as he recalled what he’d dreamt of a few nights prior. </p><p>He had been barely lucid, in a sort of dreamlike state when he heard Hermione’s soft whisper.</p><p><em> I love you, Tom Riddle </em>.</p><p>Tom was sure that he had dreamt it, but the sound of those words uttered in her voice drove him insane; it had echoed throughout his consciousness for days. </p><p>Tom swallowed as his dark eyes rested on the witch in his arms. She was like a tight chain around his heart, slowly constricting, sucking the breath from his lungs.</p><p>She stirred, sighing as she lifted her head to look at him. </p><p>“Happy birthday,” she mumbled.</p><p>He smirked. “Good morning.”</p><p>She moaned sleepily in response.</p><p>Tom chuckled and began to extricate himself from her, much to her disapproval. “Don’t fight me, little witch, I’ll bring you some tea.”</p><p>He left and after a bit, came back with a cup of coffee and a cup of tea, which he handed to her as she sat up groggily, hugging the sheet to her bare chest as she propped herself up on the many pillows she’d brought to his flat. </p><p>Tom took a sip of coffee and sat it on the table beside his bed, then pulled his cigarettes out of the drawer, took out a cigarette, and began to light it.</p><p>After a few sips of tea, Hermione asked, “What do you want for your birthday, Tom?”</p><p>“Sex,” he breathed, expelling smoke from his mouth and nostrils. “And lots of it.”</p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes, thinking to herself that all men were the same, murderous dark lord or not. “You idiot. You have that every day.”</p><p>He laughed under his breath. “So I do.”</p><p>“So what do you want? Be serious.”</p><p>He flicked the ash into the ashtray beside his bed. “I don’t want presents. I want to go on a date. With you.”</p><p>Hermione’s eyebrows shot up. “In public?”</p><p>Tom took a drag. “We can keep to the muggle sector if you’re that embarrassed to be seen with me, little witch.”</p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes again. “It’s not <em> that </em>and you know it.”</p><p>“What is it then, darling?”</p><p>“I… Well, I don’t know. I suppose I’m just so high profile these days that I know the papers will have a field day with whomever I’m seen with and I don’t want the interference.”</p><p>Tom inhaled the smoke deep into his lungs in silence before releasing it and reaching for his coffee. “You had no qualms about being seen with Alphard Black or Gaspard Dufresne. Or any number of other idiotic wizards.”</p><p>“But I don’t care about any of them.”</p><p>Tom ran his tongue over his teeth. “And you care about me?”</p><p>Hermione huffed. “Well, obviously.”</p><p>Tom laughed under his breath. “Let’s go to Paris.”</p><p>“Paris? It’s New Year’s Eve.”</p><p>“Precisely.”</p><p>Hermione’s eyes lit up. “<em> Paris… </em>”</p><p>Tom nodded once. “Paris.”</p><p>Hermione smiled impishly. “What will we do in Paris?”</p><p>Tom inhaled through his cigarette, and on his exhale, he muttered, “The question is, what won’t we do in Paris?”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Later that morning, Hermione apparated to her flat to change her clothing and to pack for an overnight stay. She bit her lip as she gingerly tucked a box of lingerie in her beaded bag. Although he’d said no presents, she had gone to the trouble of being fitted for a daring new set of lingerie, which she’d tucked away on purpose, saving it for his birthday. Hermione grinned to herself as she imagined his reaction.</p><p>Once she’d packed everything, she donned a bold red sheath dress, pumps, and a fur-trimmed coat. She apparated back to Tom’s flat to find him waiting for her. Hermione looked him over to find him blacked out from head to toe in a brand new tailored suit and the shiniest shoes she’d ever seen. She bit her lip as she took in his appearance. His hair, which normally curled over his forehead, was slicked back dashingly and it made Hermione’s heart skip several beats. He gave the impression of a weapon, sharp and dangerous, with a threatening glint in his black eyes.</p><p>“Where are your things?” she asked.</p><p>He smiled and opened his suit coat, gesturing to his inner pocket. “I took a page from Hermione Dumbledore. Undetectable extension charm. It’s quite brilliant.”</p><p>“Copycat,” she muttered with a smirk.</p><p>He grinned. “Ready, darling?”</p><p>Her eyes widened. “Are we… <em> apparating </em>there?”</p><p>He reached out his hand. “I have one stop first.”</p><p>She gulped and took his hand, and the moment she did, he apparated them away.</p><p>A few seconds later, she looked around herself and found them standing on the sidewalk in front of Midas Bank. The great gold fans of the sign gleamed in the sunlight, like a cluster of art deco sunbeams.</p><p>“The bank?” she questioned.</p><p>“I need to exchange galleons.”</p><p>“Do you bank here, Tom?”</p><p>He smirked. “Of course. What kind of boyfriend would I be if I didn’t?”</p><p>Her cheeks turned blush pink at his use of the word ‘boyfriend.’ They’d never actually made it official, but she couldn’t bring herself to argue it, especially after she’d been wearing his ring for several weeks without taking it off even once.</p><p>“I already have muggle money, Tom. It’s your birthday, so shouldn’t I be the one to treat you?”</p><p>He took a deep breath. “See, that’s not how this works. It’s <em> my </em> birthday, so I get to pay for the entire trip if I decide.” He pressed his tongue against his cheek. “In fact, I get to decide what we do, where we do it, how we do it, <em> and </em>how many times we do it.”</p><p>Her eyebrows lifted. “Oh, is that so?”</p><p>He nodded, his eyes narrowing as he slipped an arm around her waist and leaned into her to whisper, “I think you should call me <em> Master </em>for the rest of the day.”</p><p>Her mouth fell open slightly. “I think your birthday is bringing out a different side of you.”</p><p>He shook his head. “Not at all. I’m always this way. You just see less of it than most people.” He lowered his voice to a low whisper. “But since it’s my birthday, I have the leverage I need to force you into the most <em> filthy </em>acts imaginable.”</p><p>Her breath caught. She turned to him and whispered softly, “Jokes on you. I would have done them anyway, birthday or not.”</p><p>He sucked in a sharp breath as a low groan issued from his throat, but he held his tongue as he approached the desk and proceeded to make a withdrawal. </p><p>Hermione took the moment to spin around, gazing up at the domed glass ceiling as her pumps clicked against the pale marble floors. Every inch of the bank was sleek and modern, showing off a midcentury style interior.</p><p>Once Tom was finished, they walked back outside. Hermione was somewhat relieved that no one in the bank had recognized her. It hadn’t been very busy, what with being New Year’s Eve. </p><p>Tom withdrew a potion from his jacket. “You’re going to want to take this, Hermione. Perhaps taking it <em> before </em>we apparate will better curb the effects.”</p><p>Hermione’s eyes widened. “We <em> are </em>apparating, then?”</p><p>“How else?”</p><p>“I thought perhaps… a portkey?”</p><p>“This is faster. You’ve got to get ministry approval to set up a portkey.”</p><p>Hermione looked at Tom nervously. “Have you ever apparated with another person that far before?”</p><p>“I apparated with Lestrange to France a couple months ago. He was fine, although he acted like a milksop about it.”</p><p>“Well,” she said anxiously. “I suppose as long as he wasn’t splinched.”</p><p>Tom smiled. “You don’t have to worry about that at all, Hermione. Just hold on to me and let me do the lifting.”</p><p>She bit her lip. “Alright.”</p><p>Tom gazed at her with a heated stare and stepped forward, slipping his hands beneath her coat and sliding them around her waist. Their breaths were visible, mingling together in the frigid air.</p><p>Hermione winced and her eyes closed tightly as he began to turn on his heel, lifting her and turning her along with him. </p><p>There was a loud cracking sound, and suddenly they were standing in an empty alleyway in the middle of Paris.</p><p>Hermione gripped tightly onto Tom’s suit jacket, breathing in and out deeply as she felt sudden nausea gripping her. </p><p>“Just breathe in and out, little witch. The potion should be helping.”</p><p>She nodded, then leaned into him a bit more as her equilibrium was thrown off. He caught her and held her against his chest until the dizziness subsided. “Do you think you’ll be sick?”</p><p>She shook her head. “No,” she breathed shakily. </p><p>After a few minutes of deep breathing exercises, she stood back, then blinked several times as she took in her surroundings. “Where are we?”</p><p>“You handled that better than Lestrange,” he muttered, shaking his head. “We should be close to 15 Place Vendome. The Ritz Paris.”</p><p>“The Ritz? Why here?”</p><p>“Because it’s where we’re staying tonight.”</p><p>“You mean you already had this planned out?”</p><p>“For weeks.”</p><p>Her brows furrowed. “The Ritz has got to be rather expensive.”</p><p>He held his hand out to her with a smile. “Come.”</p><p>As they turned down several streets, they came within sight of the building. Once they entered the historic hotel, with its intricate architecture and costly trappings, Tom approached the front desk and began conversing with the female clerk, who eyed him coyly, giving him a sparkling smile. Hermione would have been seriously irritated with the girl, if she wasn’t so distracted by the fact that Tom was speaking what appeared to be <em> perfect </em>French.</p><p>“Since when do you speak French?” she asked, aghast.</p><p>He turned to Hermione. “I learned French during my spare time at Hogwarts. Also during the summer, since there was very little to do at the orphanage but study. I also taught myself Latin, German, and some Greek. I practiced speaking with one of the German orphans.”</p><p>“What possessed you to learn languages?”</p><p>“There’s quite a few magical books written in other languages. Old books. Particularly Latin. It’s difficult to get the full understanding of some texts due to shoddy translations. So I just learned. I found the romance languages to be very easy to learn. Lots of overlap and cognates.”</p><p>“Merlin, Tom. You’re so very accomplished.”</p><p>“So are you, little witch.”</p><p>The desk clerk who’d walked away suddenly approached and handed Tom a pair of keys. Tom thanked her and she smiled widely, then fixed Hermione with a cool stare before walking away.</p><p>Hermione decided to ignore it because, as it happened, he <em> was </em> looking extremely fit. In fact, he was looking all <em> too </em>devilishly fit, and coupled with the beautiful French just rolling off his tongue, Hermione was starting to feel a bit flustered. As she followed him into the elevator, she said, “Say something else to me in French.”</p><p>He cocked an eyebrow. “Why?”</p><p>She shrugged, but she couldn’t keep her cheeks from reddening. “No reason.”</p><p>He stared at her with narrowed eyes roaming her face as realization began to dawn. He leaned into her and whispered out of earshot of the couple on the other side of the elevator, “Does it turn you on when I speak French?”</p><p>Hermione cut her eyes over at him nervously, and muttered, “Perhaps.”</p><p>He grinned and laughed lightly under his breath before muttering in her ear, “<em> Je t'aime, Hermione, et je vais t'épouser... crois moi</em>.”</p><p>Hermione’s eyes widened and she swallowed. “What does that mean?”</p><p>He shrugged nonchalantly. “It’s just a common French phrase.”</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>His obsidian eyes glittered. “I think I shall definitely weaponize this to my advantage.”</p><p>“Do so at your own risk, Riddle.”</p><p>He tipped his head back and laughed. “I do love it when you threaten me, little witch.”</p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes. “I’m trying to be on my best behavior since it’s your birthday but you make it very difficult.”</p><p>His voice was deep and husky as he muttered, “I don’t want you on your best behavior. I want you on your absolute <em> worst </em>behavior.”</p><p>Hermione’s stomach began to do strange things, and her heart skipped several beats. She turned to Riddle as they rode up the elevator and did something that Dumbledore had taught her in his occlumency training. She brushed up against Tom’s occlumency walls and he narrowed his eyes at her attempt to invade, but upon seeing the impish smirk on her face, he let them down slowly, allowing her to project an image into his mind. </p><p>She bit her lip as his eyebrows shot up. She tried not to laugh as she watched him react, tilting his head and pressing his tongue against his cheek.</p><p>He leaned in and his voice was barely a whisper. “If you don’t stop, I’m going to fuck you right here in this elevator, in front of this poor elderly couple.”</p><p>Hermione couldn’t help herself from bursting into laughter. She tried desperately to sober up, placing a hand over her mouth but her face was red from the need to giggle like a schoolgirl. The couple sharing the space with them scowled at her rudely, and could not make their departure quickly enough when the elevator doors opened. </p><p>“I hate you,” she whispered breathlessly.</p><p>“No, you don’t.” He snaked his arm around her waist and pushed her against the wall of the hallway. “I think you love me.” </p><p>Hermione’s lips parted and her chest heaved with a giddy sort of euphoria. “What makes you think that?”</p><p>His eyes fell to her mouth. “Intuition.”</p><p>The elevator suddenly dinged and another guest walked out. They gave Tom and Hermione a disgruntled look and hurried by.</p><p>Tom grinned at Hermione, who could not stop giggling. “You’re flustering all the muggles, Hermione.”</p><p>“Better than feeding them to giants, I suppose.”</p><p>At that, Hermione sobered. She took his hand when he offered it, and let him lead her to their suite. </p>

<h2 class="heading">Paris, Acte 2</h2>
</div>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Hermione sat across from Tom in a secluded corner of La Tour D’Argent, one of the oldest restaurants in Paris. </p><p>She gazed out through the glass walls of the sixth floor, marveling at the evening view of the Seine and the lights of the sprawling city below them. Hermione wore a golden dress of spun silk, adorned with tiny jewels sewn into the fabric; it hung over her body like tinsel. Elbow-length gloves covered her arms, though she wore his black and gold Gaunt ring over the satin. Around her neck hung the phoenix and serpent necklace, and diamond earrings dangled from her ears like drops of ice. </p><p>Tom’s eyes gleamed preternaturally as they roamed her appearance. Instead of using magic, he reached for the bottle of wine that sat between them and refilled her glass. </p><p>He sighed. “No smoking up here. How brutal.”</p><p>Hermione smirked. “I think <em> you </em>might be the one who needs an intervention now.”</p><p>He snorted. “Over my dead body.”</p><p>She lifted a brow. “Is that a challenge?”</p><p>His eyes narrowed slightly. “Do you want to kill me, Hermione?”</p><p>“It’s like you said to me once. I prefer you alive more than dead.”</p><p>He leaned forward with eyes narrowed. “If you kill me, who would you then enlist to keep your voracious sexual appetite satisfied?”</p><p>She pinned him with a sardonic glare. “You’re one to talk.”</p><p>He ran his tongue over his top teeth, fighting back a grin.</p><p>Hermione picked at her food. She’d not been hungry of late. Her inner person was too wrapped up in torturous turmoil to eat. Tom looked out through the glass, his eyes taking in the scenery of the city, and Hermione took the opportunity to observe him. </p><p><em> So devastatingly handsome, </em> she thought to herself. Like a perfectly crafted blade, one that could carve her heart out of her chest like a butcher.</p><p>Tom was so utterly different than she’d ever imagined him to be. She had to continue to remind herself that he’d only begun to rise to power around the 1970s, which was roughly twenty years in the future. She thought of the great strides he’d made in the realm of magic over the past year, of his immense power, which she often felt brimming from his person, as if it could barely be contained by his human frame.</p><p>She couldn’t imagine him becoming <em>more</em> powerful.</p><p>Twenty years was a lot of time for someone to change. It made her feel marginally better to know that the monster she and her friends had destroyed in 1998 was separated from the Tom she cared about now, by about fifty years. </p><p><em> But one day, </em> she told herself, <em> he will be that person. </em> </p><p>There was no changing fate, was there?</p><p>Unrest settled over Hermione, a dark cloud of gloom, a sense of inevitable punishment and bitter unfairness. Why was <em> this </em>her fate? To fight in a ghastly war, nearly losing everything dear to her, then to have her entire life severed by that same dark wizard, violently thrown back into time, only to fall in love with that very same person who’d caused her such immense suffering… a man she would eventually hate. Someone evil, mangled, and depraved. It was inevitable. Shakespeare himself couldn’t have written a more sorrowful tragedy.</p><p>Hermione turned her gaze to him, her keen eyesight tracing the contours of his perfect jawline, the gaunt, sculpted cheekbones and perfect lips. Hermione thought to herself that he was truly a work of art. She mused that perhaps she was a bit biased, and she was embarrassed to admit to herself that she loved <em>everything</em> about Tom. His obsessive habits, his devilish grins, his ingeniousness and forward way of thinking, his habit of teasing her… the way that he managed to be both predictable <em>and</em> shockingly spontaneous, all at once. She even loved the way he took control during sex, but even then, he managed to surprise her, by intermittently handing over the reins to her just as soon as she’d begun to grow comfortable, by pushing her to be bold and powerful and to step beyond her comfort zone. </p><p>Hermione’s lips parted involuntarily as she watched him. She realized with some devastation that her heart would break if he one day became that terrifying, wraithlike creature from the future, the one who’d torn himself apart through dark, ritualistic magic, descending into madness, a sadist given over to his blackest nature, a mental case more unhinged than the Marquis de Sade. </p><p>How had she found herself here? On a romantic getaway in Paris, the city of love, with her mortal enemy?</p><p>“Did you know,” Tom began, “that the Wright brothers dined here? Many famous writers as well. Muggles. In fact, F. Scott Fitzgerald stayed often at the Ritz, where we are staying.”</p><p>“Fitzgerald is one of my favorite authors,” she replied. “You know so much about Muggle culture, Tom. I'm still rather surprised by it.”</p><p>He inclined his head pensively. “We both were raised as muggles, Hermione. I suppose we have that in common.”</p><p>“Why do you want me, Tom?”</p><p>His brows furrowed sharply and his eyes flicked to her face. He was clearly caught off guard by the question. “What?”</p><p>Hermione swallowed. “What are we doing? Why… why <em>me</em>, Tom, of all people? It’s not as if you don’t have countless other witches lining up on your doorstep. Purebloods. I can’t understand how you could just casually throw out your beliefs for a… a <em> mudblood</em>. That’s what you would’ve called me, right? If you didn’t know me. If we weren’t fucking each other. Would we even be sleeping together at all if you'd known it from the start?”</p><p>Tom stared at her, his expression frozen. His eyes were narrowed and they roamed her face, as if he were attempting to understand her sudden shift in mood. “I suppose I could ask the same of you. Why are you here if you have some vendetta against the person I am in the future?” he asked quietly.</p><p>Hermione looked back out through the glass, sinking deeper into her thoughts.</p><p>"Why do I want you?" Tom continued to watch her solemnly. “You want me to tell you how I feel about you? Do you want poetry, Hermione? Do I strike you as a poet?” He cocked his jaw to the side. “How do I love thee? Let me count the ways…”</p><p>“Forget it,” she said bitterly.</p><p>He cocked his head, his eyebrows knitting in confusion. He rarely saw Hermione in these moods.</p><p>“Hermione.”</p><p>She refused to look at him.</p><p>Tom took a deep, measured breath. “Do you think me so incapable of growth?” he asked, an edge to his voice. “You’ve known some future version of me that you constantly pit me up against, quite unfairly I might add, since you refuse to tell me the truth of what I’ve done to injure you. You leave me in the dark to try to win your affection against all odds, although you somehow still find it permissable to <em> fuck </em> me, disregarding the grievances you hold against my future self. Yet, you do not <em> free </em> me from these offenses, despite the fact that I have no bloody idea what I’ve done to hurt you and I’ve not, to <em> my </em> knowledge, done anything to hurt you since I've met you. If you want to argue morals, then that, my dear, is woefully unfair. As is the fact that the witch that I want is a self-righteous cunt who thinks of me as her mortal enemy.” His eyes darkened. “I don't want <em> another </em>witch, and I do not care about blood purity, as I've already stated before. If I had my way, I’d have no witch at all. I’d rather be alone forever than suffer this torturous purgatory any longer.”</p><p>"You can be alone, Tom. Don't let me stand in the way of that."</p><p>Tom sat forward sharply, drawing the attention of the muggles at nearby tables. He lowered his voice and said angrily, "As long as you're alive, you fucking belong to me. Get that through your thick... <em>mudblood</em>... skull."</p><p>Hermione scoffed. "That's a fine way to speak to a witch, Tom."</p><p>"Yes, well, you're pissing me off, Dumbledore. Here I am attempting to treat you like a bloody princess and you're acting like a fucking brat."</p><p>Hermione scowled at him. “Think of your future goals, Tom. Think of what your little Slytherin friends want more than anything. Muggles… innocent people, <em> beneath </em> them, subservient to wizards. Mudbloods, annihilated, wiped from the face of the planet. Or better yet, put in chains.”</p><p>Tom cocked his head to the side, examining her. “I would never do those things to you, Hermione.”</p><p>“You already tried, Tom,” she muttered venomously. Then she stood. “Good thing you failed.”</p><p>Hermione walked away, making her way to the elevator.</p><p>Tom sat for several minutes, gazing out over the Seine river, his chest in knots. Then, he stood, reached into his suit coat, and withdrew an amount of money well past what the meal cost and dropped it onto the table. </p><p>
<em> What was this witch doing to him?  </em>
</p><p>Tom barely recognized himself anymore.</p><p>He took a deep breath, and went to find Hermione.<br/><br/></p><hr/><p> </p><p>Tom strode down the street just past the restaurant, his gaze set on Hermione’s petite form as she stood alone on the sidewalk, her arms wrapped around herself. </p><p>She didn’t turn away from him when he approached and pulled her closer, slipping his arms around her. He wandlessly cast a warming charm on both of them. </p><p>She buried her face in his jacket. Minutes went by. Muggles passed on either side of them, but neither paid them any mind.</p><p>Finally, Hermione spoke. “I’m sorry,” she mumbled into his coat. “It’s your birthday and I’ve ruined it.”</p><p>He chuckled under his breath. “My birthday isn’t over, little witch. You have time to make it up to me.”</p><p>Hermione leaned back and he caught a glimpse of her rolling her eyes, but her lips spread into a wry smile. </p><p>Tom threaded his fingers with hers, his eyes catching on his horcux, which was slid over her satin glove onto her finger. He ran his thumb over it absently. “You want to know why I want you?” He blinked several times, his jaw tensing and relaxing as he struggled to articulate his thoughts. “I’m not gifted with words, Hermione. I have none to describe what it is about you that makes me so weak. You are an enigma… a total mystery to me. Words don’t seem to do you any justice. They are powerless to describe the pedestal upon which I’ve placed you. In my eyes, you are the embodiment of divinity.” His cheek muscles rippled as he gazed down at her, almost seeming to be at war with himself. Their breaths were like puffs of vapor in the air. “This is... complex. I don’t pretend to know how to navigate it. I will probably do it wrong, because I’ve never felt this way about anyone in my entire life.”</p><p>Hermione’s warm brown eyes were wide as she watched him. Her normally tan skin had grown pale, as if she’d seen a ghost. Her eyes roamed his face until tears began to brim within them. She blinked, and the tears spilled over onto her cheeks, which were pink from the cold night air. “It seems impossible for us to feel this way about each other, Tom, given who we are. It feels wrong and right, all at once.” she said shakily. </p><p>Tom’s eyes narrowed, not comprehending her response. “Do you think me incapable of feeling? Have I not communicated it in so many ways to you?” He leaned in, placing his hand on her hip as he whispered in her ear, “Shall I take you back to our hotel room and show you just how deeply you move me, little witch? When words fail me, I can worship you in a thousand other ways.”</p><p>Hermione’s breathing was shaky from the cold as much as the anticipation. “You said to me once that you weren’t a romantic. What a liar you are.”</p><p>He shook his head, his expression serious as he took out his cigarettes. He withdrew one and lit it wandlessly, disregarding the muggles passing by. As the smoke spilled from his mouth, he muttered, “I’m not a romantic, Hermione. A romantic searches for romance in everything. I’m merely a realist. A realist simply accepts what happens, without trying to paint a more beautiful picture… without being <em> idealistic </em> about what the future holds.” He took her chin between his thumb and forefinger and tilted her face up. “I don’t need to paint you any more beautiful, Hermione. You are what I fucking want, and I want you <em>exactly</em> as you are, no matter what the future holds.” </p><p>He leaned down and kissed her, and despite the frigid cold, Hermione melted into a warm puddle as soon as his lips touched hers.</p><p>“Now,” he murmured as he broke the kiss. “Time for a unique Parisian experience.”<br/><br/></p><hr/><p><br/>Tom brought Hermione to a cabaret called Bal Tabarin, a successful show which rivaled Moulin Rouge, located at 36, rue Victor-Massé in the 9th arrondissement. It was rather lucky that he’d planned their little rendezvous in advance, because the New Year’s Eve show had been sold out for months.</p><p>As they took their seats, Tom said quietly, “You’d hardly even know the Germans occupied this city only a few years ago.”</p><p>Hermione’s eyes widened. She’d been so distracted with her career in the wizarding world that she’d hardly paid attention to the state of the muggle world. She shook her head, realizing that World War II had only ended three years prior to her arrival in the past. </p><p>“I suppose I’m so used to thinking of those events as ancient history. It’s strange to find myself living in a time when it’s all so fresh.”</p><p>The theater was dark and intimate, and before the show began, Hermione could feel Tom’s presence beside her, his unique dark magic like an energy crackling around her. It no longer alarmed her as it used to, but it awakened a deep excitement in the pit of her stomach. He leaned over to whisper something in her ear as he pointed to the VIP section. He’d spotted a very famous film star, Ingrid Bergman. Hermione’s eyes widened as she searched the theater, but she could hardly pay attention to the actress because she could smell Tom’s cologne, and he’d laid his hand on her knee, causing her heart to beat rapidly in her chest.</p><p>Tom cut his eyes over at Hermione, and she could feel the heat of his gaze. She took a tremulous breath, her senses heightened to an astonishing degree. Hermione felt her pulse thudding thickly in her throat, the imperceptible tightening of his fingers around her knee, the faded murmurs of the audience in her ears, the brush of his shoulder against hers. His scent engulfed her, more intoxicating than the Cabernet Franc she’d imbibed liberally at dinner.</p><p>The lights went down, and the spotlights came on, highlighting the dancers. Once the show began, Hermione was relieved to find that her attention was fully on the talented dancers, the intricate costumes, and the magnificent choreography.</p><p>When it was over, Hermione emerged from the show flushed and beaming. “Oh, I loved it! It was brilliant! To see a real cabaret in 1940s Paris? I think I’ve died and gone to Olympus.”</p><p>He slid his arm around her waist as they left the cabaret and walked down the sidewalk. “I’d prefer it if you didn’t die, little witch. Besides, you’d be in Asphodel Fields, not Olympus.”</p><p>“You know what I find hilarious, Tom? I was always called an <em> insufferable know-it-all  </em> during my school days at Hogwarts. But I think <em> you’re </em> the insufferable one between the two of us.”</p><p>He smirked. “Well, I do know practically <em> everything </em>, so you’re not far off base.”</p><p>“You’re so humble, too.” She grinned smugly. </p><p>“Don’t use my own words against me. It will end very badly for you.”</p><p>Hermione’s eyebrows shot up. “Oh really? What do you mean by that?”</p><p>Tom gripped her by the waist and yanked her against him in the middle of the busy street. Their lips were centimeters apart as he whispered, “You know precisely what I mean, little witch.”</p><p>Hermione bit her lip as her eyes fell to his mouth. “I may be in the mood to tempt fate.”</p><p>His bottomless eyes burned into her, appearing like portals to hades. “You and I tempted fate the moment we met.”</p><p>Hermione was breathless as she swallowed. “What shall we do now?”</p><p>“What do you want to do, little witch?”</p><p>She smoothed the collar of his suit coat. “Well, it’s <em> your </em> birthday.”</p><p>He reached up and laid his hand around her throat, flexing gently. “I say we go back to our suite, which happens to have a perfect view of the Arc Triomphe. We open a bottle of vintage elf-made wine, and we watch the fireworks and we admire the view of the Eiffel Tower at night.” He lowered his voice, and Hermione caught her breath at the way the deep timbre pierced her. “Then, at midnight, I will kiss you, and you’ll pretend that I never hurt you in your past life, and I’ll pretend that you don’t plan to hurt me in this one.”</p><p>Tom and Hermione locked eyes, and there was an inexplicable pull between their stares, a synergy between their bodies, and between the substance of their souls.</p><p>In the barest hint of a whisper, Hermione breathed,</p><p>“Deal.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>It was around eleven when Hermione and Tom returned to the Ritz and made their way up to the Suite Mansart. Tom had chosen it specifically for its private terrace which boasted a spectacular view of the city. </p><p>He withdrew a bottle of wine from the inner pocket of his suit and sat it out onto the terrace to chill.</p><p>Hermione suddenly became very nervous and told Tom that she needed a few minutes to freshen up. She escaped to the bathroom and gazed at herself in the mirror. Suddenly, she felt as anxious as the first time she’d stayed at his flat overnight.</p><p>Why did she feel so apprehensive? How many nights had they already spent together? They’d slept in the same bed countless times, and Hermione couldn’t even fathom how many times they’d had sex. </p><p>What made this night so different? Perhaps, because they were in another city, rather than her own flat? </p><p>Hermione’s heart raced. </p><p>She unhooked her beaded bag from the bracelet on her wrist and enlarged it with a flick of her wand. As she pulled the box of lingerie out of the bag, she was hit with a sudden realization. </p><p>It was his admission of feelings that had her in a state of panic.</p><p>She’d known for some time that he was attracted to her, and she’d been aware that Tom had an unusual obsession with her, similar to his obsession with his horcruxes.</p><p>But the unveiling of his true feelings had been gentle and hesitant, brimming with raw honesty.</p><p>Lord Voldemort had just admitted that she, Hermione Granger, had the power to <em> hurt </em> him.</p><p>
<em> … and I’ll pretend that you don’t plan to hurt me in this one. </em>
</p><p>Was he afraid that she would break his heart?</p><p>Hermione had been so fearful of being hurt herself that she hadn’t given any thought to how Tom might feel. In fact, she hadn’t thought him capable of feeling anything remotely resembling real love or affection.</p><p>That was it, wasn’t it?</p><p>Now that she knew his real feelings, Hermione was terrified that she would jump off the deep end with him and ignore his dangerous and destructive side. She was afraid of forgetting about the monster that he was destined to become.</p><p>Hermione knew that she had an unyieldingly loyal side that made her blind to character failings. It was that same trait that caused her to completely overlook the fact that Ron Weasley was utterly wrong for her.</p><p>She never wanted to be like one of those muggle cartel wives who played house while their husbands committed gruesome acts of violence.</p><p>She shoved the fear deep down. She wouldn’t think about it tonight. </p><p>Tonight, she was in the magical city of Paris. It was New Year’s Eve, and it was Tom’s birthday, and she had a scandalous new set of lingerie designed specifically for his eyes.</p><p>Hermione smiled impishly as she unzipped her gown and began to change.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Tom stood on the balcony in the chilly night air, gazing out at the city lights.</p><p dir="ltr">He was on his fourth glass of muggle whiskey.</p><p dir="ltr">He knocked it back while he waited for Hermione. Then, he lit a cigarette and poured another glass. </p><p dir="ltr">Tom didn’t want to think about what he’d admitted to Hermione. He didn’t want to think about his feelings, or what he’d done to her in the future.</p><p dir="ltr">He wanted to get drunk and fuck her senseless.</p><p dir="ltr">Sometimes it felt as if railing her was the only way to get through to her. Otherwise, she’d become lost in her thoughts and musings, drowning in the throes of her past life.</p><p dir="ltr">He’d simply have to fuck her until her memories faded away.</p><p dir="ltr">Tom was ready to go back to London and continue his search for the relic he needed for the soul bond ritual.</p><p dir="ltr">Tom pondered everything he’d read about the Morai. He had hoped that finding the Thread of Fate would be simple, but the more he searched, the more obscure the item became.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to that obstacle, the book on soul anatomy had referred to an incantation in the Galdrabok, which was a rare, Icelandic Book of Magic written in the 17th century by four witches and wizards of unknown identity. It contained instructions for performing forty-seven spells, as well as how to create magical staffs and rune stones. Tom would have loved to get his hands on it, regardless of the soul bond, but apparently, it contained a rather important incantation relating to the soul-stitching ceremony, much to Tom’s frustration. Now, he had to find two rare relics. Tom was beginning to see why the soul bond was considered to be a myth: because it was nearly impossible to complete the ritual.</p><p dir="ltr">However, Tom Riddle was no ordinary wizard. He had patience on his side, and his horcruxes gave him nothing but time. If he could somehow convince Hermione to make a horcrux, then she would have immortality as well. Then, he’d have plenty of time to search for the relics. If Hermione refused, then he could also devote a fair bit of time to the study of alchemy. Tom could, in all likelihood, discover another means of immortality for Hermione.</p><p dir="ltr">There were lights all throughout the city of Paris. Fireworks lit the brilliant night sky intermittently. Tom took another drag from his cigarette, then another drink of whiskey. </p><p dir="ltr">Magic. He couldn’t stop thinking about it. There was nothing Tom loved more than the pursuit of it, to study and dissect it, to give himself over to the intuitive creation of new forms of magic.</p><p dir="ltr">He imagined himself among the most powerful witches and wizards of all time. </p><p dir="ltr">Merlin. Salazar Slytherin. Herpo the Foul. Morgan Le Fay. Nicolas Flamel. Rasputin. John Dee. Albus Dumbledore. Gellert Grindelwald.</p><p dir="ltr">Lord Voldemort.</p><p dir="ltr">The door to the terrace suddenly opened, and Hermione emerged wearing a long black dress robe tied around her waist. Her hair was loose and fell in smooth waves around her shoulders. </p><p dir="ltr">Tom lifted his cigarette to his lips and inhaled as he let his eyes boldly trail over her form. </p><p dir="ltr">He wanted to know what kind of spell this witch had cast to make him crave her more with each passing day. </p><p dir="ltr">He could give up smoking in a heartbeat before he could give her up.</p><p dir="ltr">Her heels clicked softly on the stone as she approached. Tom’s eyes followed her until she stood beside him, leaning back against the heavy stone railing. </p><p dir="ltr">“Tom?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Hmm?”</p><p dir="ltr"> “Can you teach me to apparate long distances, like you do?”</p><p dir="ltr">He took a long drag from his cigarette. “Of course, if you like. But I warn you, it’s not easy.”</p><p dir="ltr">“I can’t imagine that it is,” she replied. “Otherwise, everyone would be able to do it.”</p><p dir="ltr">Tom knocked back the remainder of his whiskey, letting it burn his throat.</p><p dir="ltr">Hermione reached out and laid a hand on his chest. Tom flicked his eyes down to where her palm lay against his suit jacket, directly over the place where the new magical runes were etched into his pale flesh. His jaw tensed as he felt the blood rushing to his cock. He took a deep breath, then cut his eyes to Hermione.</p><p dir="ltr">“Thank you for bringing me here, Tom… to Paris. It’s been unforgettable.”</p><p dir="ltr">Tom was rooted to the spot, only aware of the touch of her hand against his chest. After a moment, his lips parted, and he spoke slowly. “You’re welcome, Hermione.”</p><p dir="ltr">He could feel her gaze on him, her eyes roaming his face searchingly, but he didn’t look at her. He stared out over the city, as if he could prolong his ravenous hunger if he merely kept his eyes off of her.</p><p dir="ltr">“Tom,” she whispered. “Please look at me.”</p><p dir="ltr">His jaw muscles flexed before he turned his head, his eyes finally piercing into hers. She stood looking up at him, and he read the uncertainty in her wide doe eyes, which were the same warm color as the whiskey he’d been drinking. </p><p dir="ltr">Tom stared back at her, his expression masked.</p><p dir="ltr">“I’m sorry about everything I said… before the cabaret,” she whispered, her breath a cloud of vapor in the cold night air. “It was bad timing to broach those subjects.”</p><p dir="ltr">Tom merely stared at her. The whiskey had made him stoic and pensive, and lustful. Each word that fell from her pretty lips was like a call to some beast deep within him. Her hesitancy, the careful way in which she apologized drove him mad. He stood very still.</p><p dir="ltr">He wanted to devour her.</p><p dir="ltr">Tom swallowed thickly and his adam’s apple bobbed with the effort. He shook his head very slightly. “It’s nothing, Hermione. There’s no perfect time to bring it up.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Yes, but to do so on your birthday was very, <em>very</em> stupid of me… and callous, and ungrateful. I-” She cut herself off as if thinking through her words carefully. “I want you to know that… I do care for you, too.” Hermione swallowed, her eyes darting around apprehensively, searching for anything to look at besides the penetrating black orbs of his eyes. “I mean that I feel… I have feelings for you, too, Tom.”</p><p dir="ltr">Tom watched her as he sucked the final drag from his cigarette before flicking it away. </p><p dir="ltr">She averted her eyes, as she crossed her arms over her chest nervously. He could sense that her heart was erratically beating against her ribcage. </p><p dir="ltr">Tom said nothing, but he reached out and hooked his fingers into the belt of her robe, pulling her toward him. He snaked his arms around her waist and let his hands slide down over her soft bum as he gripped it roughly, pressing her hips against him. Her mouth fell ajar as she felt his cock, hard against her stomach . Tom lowered his mouth to hers and kissed her, reveling in the lingering taste of wine on her tongue and the scent of lavender from her hair. Tom’s senses were on overdrive, making it impossible to focus on one sensation. He savored the sweet taste of her mouth, the feel of her softer body against his, her maddening scent, the quiet hesitancy in her demeanor… it all combined to form an intoxicating draught which Tom had no power to fight. </p><p dir="ltr">Tom reached up and gripped her hair, yanking her head back. He ran his mouth across her jawline and then followed the smooth column of her neck, not letting his lips touch her, only dragging his nose down her skin as his hot breath trailed along her chilled flesh. </p><p dir="ltr">“<em>Mon dieu</em>, Hermione,” he whispered, his voice hoarse with lust. “<em>J'ai besoin de toi</em>.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Fuck, Tom,” she moaned. “Don’t speak French, I’ll lose my mind.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Then lose it, little witch,” he muttered. “<em>Perds la tête pour moi</em>.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Shit,” she breathed shakily.</p><p dir="ltr">Tom claimed her mouth again, his tongue parting her lips forcefully as he untied the belt of her robe. His lips slanted against hers, his tongue slipping into her mouth quickly, before retreating again. He teased her, playing with her like a cat would a mouse. Hermione moaned against his lips and it sounded like a plea.</p><p dir="ltr">Tom would answer no pleas tonight.</p><p dir="ltr">He wanted to toy with her until she couldn’t take any more.</p><p dir="ltr">In that very instant, he noticed it. He had slipped his hands beneath her robe and touched silk.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite his ravenous hunger, he leaned back and pushed her robe apart and then he swallowed for a second time.</p><p dir="ltr">Beneath her robe, Hermione was garbed in Slytherin green lingerie. The veridian silk of the bustier gleamed in the low light, and pushed her full breasts upward, creating tantalizing swells which his eyes lingered on for far too long before dipping lower, devouring the slim curve of her hips, the lacy knickers, and the black, lace-trimmed stockings held up by a saucy garter belt. Tom bit his lip as he took a deep breath through his nose. The color was clearly chosen with him in mind.</p><p dir="ltr">Tom wanted to see it from behind.</p><p dir="ltr">His slow appraisal was obviously making Hermione antsy, because she rubbed her lips together and shifted her weight. </p><p dir="ltr">With some effort, he lifted his gaze to her face. When their eyes met, Hermione murmured, “Happy Birthday, Tom.”</p><p dir="ltr">Tom’s nostrils flared. </p><p dir="ltr">Within a split second, he had wandlessly vanished her knickers, eliciting a surprised gasp from her throat. He pressed her back into the railing as his hand wandered between her legs, searching out her warmth. He cupped the softness between her thighs and slid a finger inside her. He groaned when he felt her slick wet heat.</p><p dir="ltr">“Fuck,” he rasped. “You’re dripping.”</p><p dir="ltr">Tom lowered his mouth to the soft swells of her breasts and swiped his tongue over them, then bit down, aiming to leave marks. She gasped sharply.</p><p dir="ltr">“You’re mine, tonight, Hermione. I want you over and over again until you beg me to stop.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Gods, yes,” she whispered. </p><p dir="ltr">He stepped back. “Turn around.”</p><p dir="ltr">Her mouth fell open, but she did as he instructed.</p><p dir="ltr">He reached around her and yanked her robe closed, then tied the belt tight. Then he pulled her arms behind her and took the loose ends of the belt and criss crossed them, tying them securely around her wrists. </p><p dir="ltr">He bent her over the stone balustrade and then leaned over her, gripping her throat and lifting her chin back as he whispered in her ear, “Are you too cold, little witch?”</p><p dir="ltr">“No,” she whispered breathlessly.</p><p dir="ltr">“Are you sure?”</p><p dir="ltr">She nodded.</p><p dir="ltr">He released her throat and pressed her forward with his palm against the flat of her back. Then he began unbuckling his belt. He knew his witch reacted strongly to the sound, so he also ripped it from his belt loops for added effect. He smirked as she gasped. He wrapped the belt around her throat and held the ends, keeping her head lifted. He unzipped his trousers and then jerked her robe up, bunching it around her waist. </p><p dir="ltr">He ran his palm over her ass, enjoying the view of her soft curves in the daring lingerie. He leaned over and whispered in her ear, “Do you see those windows over there?” When she nodded, he muttered, “And those over there? They’re everywhere. If you scream, you’ll draw the attention of all of Paris within a five mile radius.” He leaned closer, his voice a lust-filled growl. “Behind us is a famous wizarding hotel, protected by concealment charms. If you scream, they’ll all come to see who it was, and they’ll find you, the famed Prophet writer, daughter of Albus Dumbledore, moaning like a whore for a dark wizard. So let’s see how quiet you can be, little witch.”</p><p dir="ltr">Her face was turned to the side, and Tom watched her bite her bottom lip. She shifted her weight and he grinned, knowing that the hunger was already building between her tantalizing thighs.</p><p dir="ltr">He plunged two fingers inside her soaked cunt and a groan issued forth from the back of his throat. “You’re so <em>fucking</em> tight, little witch. It makes me crazy.” </p><p dir="ltr">He was painfully hard and in need of release. He pressed his throbbing cock to her entrance with a muttered, “<em>Damn</em>.” The heat of her pussy was much more concentrated in contrast to the frigid night air. </p><p dir="ltr">He leaned over her, sliding his tip along her wet entrance as he whispered, “This is going to feel so good for you. I don’t think you’ll be able to keep quiet. I’d bet my galleons you’ll be screaming within five minutes.”</p><p dir="ltr">Then he kicked her legs apart and slid inside her, his patience finally snapping. He drove himself deep as his fingers dug into the flesh of her hips, eliciting delicious little sounds from her throat which she attempted to muffle. He could feel her tighten around him, her walls clenching with a pulsing rhythm that betrayed her need.</p><p dir="ltr">He pulled on the ends of the belt, lifting her back against him. He slid it from around her throat and and dropped it as he wrapped his arm around her neck instead. “Feel that?” he asked, drawing a whimper from her throat. “Do you feel how wet you are?”</p><p dir="ltr">He pulled out and pushed himself back in, seating himself fully within her. “I love that,” he growled against her ear as he slammed his hips into her, and he felt her tighten around him in response. “Good girl, Hermione. Soak my cock.” </p><p dir="ltr">He could hear her breathing pick up. She sucked in sharp breaths and issued soft whimpers, but she didn’t dare make any louder noises.</p><p dir="ltr">Tom smirked to himself as he vowed to change that. He would wring screams from her pretty throat before he was finished.</p><p dir="ltr">Tom looked down, his eyes drinking in the sight of his hips meeting her round ass, her tight cunt hugging his cock as he moved in and out of her. He bent his knees and reached up, gripping her shoulders as he drove himself upward, his length filling her to the hilt. She jumped forward with a gasp, but he yanked her back, holding her firmly in place.</p><p dir="ltr">“I don’t think so, baby,” he chuckled darkly. “Be still and take it like a good little witch.”</p><p dir="ltr">He thrust harder, and she whimpered. His hand moved from her shoulder to the back of her neck and his other gripped her hip, holding her in place as he fucked her with deep strokes, hitting her sweet spot over and over. </p><p dir="ltr">“Do you know how often I think about you, Hermione? I imagine a million different ways to fuck you. It’s like a bloody film playing over and over in the back of my mind every day while I’m at work. You’re a delicious torture for me.” His hand moved from the back of her neck to her mouth and he shoved the two fingers he’d plunged inside her between her lips. He felt her tongue slide around his fingertips, tasting herself. “You’re an outrageous slut, darling, but only for me, and I adore you for it.”</p><p dir="ltr">Tom reached around and toyed with her clit, the pads of his fingers rubbing slow circles around the area. Hermione moaned softly, her breathing jagged. He could see her breath like dense fog in the cold air.</p><p dir="ltr">“Tom,” she whispered breathlessly.</p><p dir="ltr">“What, baby?”</p><p dir="ltr">“I’m going to come.”</p><p dir="ltr">“No,” he growled. “Hold it.”</p><p dir="ltr">She released her breath in a half sob, half whimper. He felt her walls clamping down on him. He smacked her ass and then squeezed it roughly. “I said hold it.”</p><p dir="ltr">He reached into the inner pocket of his coat, pulling out the golden pocket watch that she’d given him, and he checked the time. Then he tucked it back into his pocket.</p><p dir="ltr">Tom pulled her back against his chest as he slowed his rhythm. He slid his hand into her robe and ran his fingertips over the swells of her breasts, tracing her cleavage. “I want to cum all over these.” Her mouth fell open, eyes fluttering shut in blissful lust. Tom swallowed as he took in her expression, thrusting slowly in and out of her tightness, her soft ass meeting his hips each time.</p><p dir="ltr"> “Hermione,” he breathed.</p><p dir="ltr">“Yes?” Her voice was shaky.</p><p dir="ltr">“I’ve claimed you. I hope you know that.” He gritted his teeth. “If you try to run from me, I will drag you back by your hair.”</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Fear</em>. Her pretty eyes shone with it for a moment.</p><p dir="ltr">Then she blinked, and it was gone, replaced by animal lust.</p><p dir="ltr">Tom ran the tip of his tongue over his incisors. He lowered his head and pressed his lips to her neck. Then he muttered in a deep, hoarse voice, “Scream for me, Hermione <em>Granger</em>.”</p><p dir="ltr">She gave a terrified gasp, but he didn’t allow her to turn or even speak. He shoved her down over the balustrade and jerked her hips against him. </p><p dir="ltr">He drilled into her, uttering a stream of praise and other things that could’ve been degrading, if Hermione had not been caught in the throes of shameless lust. </p><p dir="ltr">Fireworks lit the sky.</p><p dir="ltr">“Oh my gods,” she moaned, and it came out much louder than she’d intended, but the noise of the fireworks drowned out her cry.</p><p dir="ltr">“That’s it, baby.” He bent his knees, pulling her down onto him as he thrust upward, his cock hard as a rock and pulsing. “You feel incredible, Hermione.”</p><p dir="ltr">He felt her walls clench around him, steadily tightening as she came closer to release. “<em>Fuck</em>, Tom.” Her voice was a soft cry.</p><p dir="ltr">“There you are, little witch. Worship me as I worship you. I want to hear you scream for all of Paris to hear.”</p><p dir="ltr">Then, as if in answer to his commands, she came violently. Her scream was lost in the din, overshadowed by the brilliant explosions of the fireworks in the Parisian sky. </p><p dir="ltr">Tom felt his balls tightening and his length hardening, his own pleasure driven higher by the sensation of her soft walls pulsing around his cock as she rode out the waves of her orgasm.</p><p dir="ltr">His muscles tensed and he shoved himself deep within her one final time, hardening and throbbing inside her as he pumped her full of his cum. </p><p dir="ltr"><em>I love you</em>, he thought, his body bending at the waist as he leaned over her, bracing himself with one hand on the balustrade. </p><p dir="ltr">She turned her head and his hot breath fell against her cheek, which was flushed pink from the cold, as was the tip of her pert little nose.</p><p dir="ltr">Tom’s entire body was racked with pleasure, and he couldn’t speak. The orgasm lingered far longer than they typically did for him, so he didn’t withdraw from within her for several moments. </p><p dir="ltr">He slowly reached into his jacket and gripped his wand, flicking it as he cast a contraception charm. Then, he pulled himself out of her gently and let her robes fall to the stone floor. He tucked himself into his trousers and zipped them, then untied her wrists. </p><p dir="ltr">He turned her around and slid his arms around her waist. </p><p dir="ltr">They stood in the cold, night air for several minutes, their chests heaving in the aftermath. Finally, Tom muttered breathlessly, “Thank you for the birthday present, little witch. You know me quite well, it seems.”</p><p dir="ltr">Hermione’s lips curved upward, and it was a warm smile, one full of happiness and deep satisfaction.</p><p dir="ltr">Tom reached up and brushed his knuckles against her cheek. </p><p dir="ltr">She whispered, “You should know that your cum is currently dripping down my thigh.”</p><p dir="ltr">He grinned, flashing his brilliant white teeth. “Good. Leave it there.”</p><p dir="ltr">Hermione rolled her eyes, but nothing could wipe the smile from her face. “How do you know my name is Granger, Tom?”</p><p dir="ltr">He started to speak, but suddenly they were interrupted by a loud popping and cracking sounds. They turned their gazes back to the Arc Triomphe, where a dizzying amount of fireworks were shooting off, lighting the sky up with exploding, colorful spheres and sparkling streams of flickering ash. The sight was breathtaking. </p><p dir="ltr">“It’s midnight, Hermione.”</p><p dir="ltr">She turned to stare up at him, her whiskey brown eyes bright with excitement.

<p>At around nine in the morning the next day, Tom and Hermione still hadn’t gotten out of bed. In fact, they hadn’t rested much at all. They’d had sex twice more before finally calling it a night around four am, and they’d woken a mere few hours later, seeking out one another’s bodies beneath the sheets. </p><p>Tom had pulled Hermione’s legs around his hips and they’d kissed for the past hour. His hands explored every inch of her body, as if he were only just discovering it. </p><p>His teeth grazed her neck and he sucked on the skin over her jugular vein. </p><p>“Mmm,” she hummed. “Tom, I’m going to have to wear concealment charms on my neck, you’ve covered it in so many blasted purple marks.”</p><p>“Did I say you could conceal them?”</p><p>She rolled her eyes, but before she could respond, he kissed her again.</p><p>Hermione slid her fingers into his inky black hair. He tasted like cigarettes and whiskey, but she loved it, because it was the taste of Tom Riddle, and she loved Tom Riddle. </p><p>She’d never felt so giddy in her entire life. Not for Ron, nor Viktor, nor any boy she’d ever known.</p><p>Tom sucked on her lip, then tugged on it with his teeth before lowering his mouth to her chest, his tongue tracing the dip of her cleavage. He sucked on the skin there, determined to leave another mark.</p><p>Hermione bit her lip as she watched him. The muscles of his back and shoulders flexed, and in the bright morning sunlight, she realized that he looked more muscular than she’d seen him in months.</p><p>“Have you been working out, Tom?”</p><p>He slid his hand over her smooth stomach, and she admired the hard veins extending up his forearm, the long, sharp-jointed fingers ending in squarish tips, and his prominent wristbone, casually ghosting along her skin as if he were a cartographer mapping out the dips and planes of her body with a compass and a sextant.</p><p>“I have,” came his reply, his voice rough with tiredness.</p><p>“When?”</p><p>His eyes flicked up to hers very briefly, but she caught the look of hesitation. “I’ve been training my… death eaters in dueling. Among other things.”</p><p>“Oh.” She’d almost forgotten that he did, in fact, still have death eaters. He still had a plan to take over the wizarding world. Their sexual escapades wouldn’t change that. She felt his eyes on her, watching her carefully.”Well, you look… very fit.”</p><p>Tom hovered above her, his eyes raking her face and her naked form. He ran his knuckles softly along her jawline, then leaned down to kiss her once more. He hadn’t been able to stop all morning. “Don’t get weird on me, Hermione,” he whispered. “You’re mine. Stop thinking.”</p><p>Her lips parted as if she would say something, but really, what was there to say? She could tell him she loved him, but what would it change? He wanted her to ‘stop thinking.’ How could she? How could she ever stop thinking about the things he was capable of doing? How could she just pretend that he wasn’t even now searching for objects to make into horcruxes? How could she turn a blind eye to the fact that he would probably murder Hepzibah Smith in cold blood tomorrow if he knew she had the objects he desired?</p><p>She shivered, then flicked her eyes back to his. He gazed at her intensely, as if he knew she was retreating once more into herself. She knew he hated it when she did, but she couldn’t stop herself.</p><p>He ran his fingertips along her cheek. “Little witch...”</p><p>She lifted her eyebrows. “Hmm?”</p><p>“Stop thinking, or I’m going to ravish you again.”</p><p>Hermione laughed. His black eyes watched her with a blazing heat and he lowered his mouth to hers once more and kissed her. His tongue teased hers playfully, and Hermione felt peace. She felt his magic pacifying her, its energy caressing her, as if his very kisses were laced with dark magic. When he was inside her, she felt powerful, hungry, <em> on fire </em>.</p><p>When his body was against hers, she forgot about Lord Voldemort. </p><p>When he was inside her, she felt lifted onto some higher plane, as if she were a human who’d been taken away by a god. She felt invincible, permeated by the sense that she was exactly where she was supposed to be… in <em> his </em> arms.</p><p>But when his lips left hers, she grew cold and distant. Fear engulfed her. She couldn’t escape the visions of what she’d seen and experienced. She couldn’t escape the knowledge of Lord Voldemort. She heard his whispers coming from the locket as if it were still around her neck. </p><p>That locket hadn’t been made decades from now, in some year far away in the future.</p><p>It wasn’t made by that snake-like creature with the rasping voice and paper thin skin.</p><p><em> Tom </em> had made the locket… when he was only a few years older than he was now. That piece of his soul that spoke such <em> manipulative </em>, terrifying things to her… that very piece was within his body now, still unsevered from the entirety of his soul.</p><p>That reality frightened her. Was she blinded by his charm and his handsome face, just like everyone else was?  Just as Hepzibah Smith had been, just before he murdered her?</p><p>Was that <em> same </em> piece of soul manipulating her now, as it had when it was encased in Slytherin’s locket?</p><p>Fear. It crawled along her skin like a million tiny spiders.</p><p>“How do you know my last name, Tom?”</p><p>He took a deep breath. “The books you gave me… one of them had a note written on the inside cover. ‘Property of Hermione Granger.’ It also had an enchanted little doodle of a lion. Typical Gryffindor.”</p><p>“Oh, <em> Merlin </em>,” Hermione laughed, covering her face with her hand.</p><p>“I don’t know why you hide things from me, little witch. I’d hoped  we were moving beyond keeping secrets.”</p><p>Hermione smiled sadly and lowered her eyes. </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Hermione showered as they prepared to leave Paris.</p><p>Tom sat at a table on the terrace, smoking as his mind raced.</p><p>He felt as though he were losing her, before he’d even really won her over.</p><p>When he wasn’t kissing her or making love to her, she was distant and withdrawn. He couldn’t understand it. </p><p>She refused to tell him everything. She still continued to hide the truth from him, and he was beginning to wonder if his feelings for her were one-sided.</p><p>If she asked him, he would tell her anything she wanted to know. Incriminating or not, it did not matter. He was committed to telling her the truth in its completeness, even if she hated him for it. But clearly, she had no such conviction when it came to him.</p><p>She rarely asked him anything about his goals, his activities… it was as if she already knew. Not only that, but she seemed as if she didn’t <em> want </em>to know.</p><p>The mention of his death eaters seemed to have triggered something. </p><p>Perhaps it was even one of his death eaters who’d carved that scar into her arm. It would make sense.</p><p>He couldn’t shake the thought that she knew about his horcruxes. He’d given her his ring, but she’d seemingly done nothing with it… yet.</p><p>She’d also revealed something to him at dinner the previous night that obviously caused her some stress. The fact that he knew she was a mudblood and still wanted her. Truthfully, it surprised Tom as well.</p><p>Of course, deep down, Tom knew that there was nothing fundamentally different about muggleborns, just as there was nothing truly different about half-bloods. At one time in his life, he’d thought it noble to carry on Slytherin’s quest to rid Hogwarts of muggleborns. He’d bought into the ideology that muggleborns were dangerous, that they were less powerful than those with magical blood, or even that they were the parasites of the magical community.</p><p>But he’d adopted part of that stigma from his Slytherin comrades. He’d assimilated his beliefs to match their own; it was an easy way of manipulating them, which Tom was not above in the slightest, particularly if it got him what he wanted.</p><p>Additionally, Tom had never really <em> known </em> any muggleborns. There were very few, if <em> any </em>, sorted into Slytherin House. If there were, they kept quiet about it, which was wise on their part.</p><p>Truth be told, he’d been shocked when he saw the scar on her arm. But to his surprise, his reaction had not been one of disgust, nor hatred, but anger. Frustration that someone had carved up his witch and he couldn’t rip their intestines out through their mouth.</p><p>Because he didn’t know <em> who </em>had done it.</p><p>Because she wouldn’t fucking <em> tell him </em>.</p><p>And now Tom would have to get rid of her editor, forcing Hermione’s hand, and she’d be angry at him for it. </p><p>It would certainly test their relationship.</p><p>Hermione was wondering why he had so casually thrown out his ideals when he’d discovered she was muggleborn.</p><p>Well, his witch had that wrong. He’d never hated muggleborns on principle. He’d hated them by association, and he’d despised muggles because of his upbringing. He didn’t cleave to blood purity standards the way his followers did. He merely stood on their side of things, because they’d stood on his. They’d pledged their loyalty; the least Tom could do was give them a reason to stay loyal… by giving them what they wanted in return for their service.</p><p>It made sense, after all. Muggleborns almost always brought their entire muggle families into the mix, which weakened the statue of secrecy. The more muggles who knew, the more dangerous it was for wizardkind. Tom had no loyalties to muggles, nor muggleborns. He’d viewed it all quite clinically. Muggleborns were a problem. If they were put into a lower class, what did it matter to Tom? </p><p>He hadn’t really given it a second thought until he met Hermione. Now he had an emotional attachment to the witch, which was causing him to rethink his entire goal set. It was unsettling and infuriating all at once.</p><p>Tom took a drag from his cigarette. He was angry with her for shutting him out. He’d been patient, but it seemed like the longer he waited for her to tell him the truth, the further she drifted from him.</p><p>One thing was absolutely certain: he couldn’t put Hermione in danger. </p><p>Everything within Tom rose up against the idea of putting her in harm’s way. It made him viscerally sick to know that there were people who wanted her dead. Some of them were his own followers.</p><p>He grit his teeth in frustration.</p><p>Tom sometimes had to imagine her chained to him in order to curb his irrational paranoia. He had to imagine that there was some sort of spell he could cast that would protect her.</p><p>Mudblood or not, she was his.</p><p>She was <em> his </em>fucking mudblood.</p><p>Truth be told, he’d developed a sense of pride in Hermione, even a sort of attraction to the fact that she was muggleborn. </p><p>That shocked Tom most of all.</p><p>He would never tell her, but he’d fetishized it in his mind. It wasn’t exactly a fetish, per se, because he’d never been aroused by muggleborns in the past. He’d even been mildly repulsed by them. He’d only ever slept with pureblooded witches.</p><p>But when it came to Hermione…</p><p>He got hard thinking that his witch, as intelligent and magically skilled as she was… was a <em> muggleborn </em>. </p><p>He thought about the precision with which she dueled Walburga Black. Her perfect footwork and ability to think quickly under pressure. The way she’d cast three spells in one instant, even after having the killing curse thrown at her face.</p><p>Muggleborn or not, that was wildly impressive.</p><p>She was fucking special… His witch was <em> unique </em>. </p><p>She was a diamond in the rough, and she was <em> his… </em></p><p>Before he’d met her, he’d dreamed of nothing but war. </p><p>Now, nothing tasted quite the same.</p><p>Just like that, Tom’s loyalties shifted.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Tom took Hermione to breakfast in Paris and then apparated her directly back to the sidewalk of her building. He walked her up to the front door of her flat.</p><p>They lingered in the hallway of the penthouse entrance. Tom was reluctant to let her leave his sight. He knew that the next time they met, she would be angry.</p><p>He had to go. There were things he needed to take care of. Many things. </p><p>But he couldn’t take his eyes off of Hermione.</p><p>She stood on the tips of her toes and slipped her arms around his neck, burying her face in the collar of his suit coat. He turned his head involuntarily, the fragrance of her hair filling his nostrils. He ran his fingers softly along her lower back. “I have to go, Hermione,” he whispered.</p><p>She nodded against his chest. “I didn’t want last night to end,” she sighed.</p><p>He lifted his hand and brushed his knuckles against her cheek, then tucked a stray curl behind her ear. “I’ll write you on the parchment.”</p><p>She nodded, staring at the floor. “I still have to work on my article on Minister Tuft, anyway.”</p><p>Tom snorted, rolling his eyes.</p><p>Hermione’s eyebrows rose. “What? I thought you two were friends.”</p><p>Tom’s eyes cut over to her. “I’ve hated that woman from the moment I met her.”</p><p>“Oh.” She bit her lip. “I suppose I’m glad to hear that. I’m not a fan myself.”</p><p>Tom’s eyes narrowed. “Did she do something to you?”</p><p>Hermione took a deep breath. “No. She’s just rather rude. I don’t think she cares for me much.”</p><p>Tom’s jaw muscles flexed, but he said nothing. </p><p>“Go, Tom. I know you have things to do.”</p><p>He nodded, his expression thoughtful. “I can’t come tonight… but come to my flat tomorrow.”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>His gaze was intense as he watched her, then he leaned down and kissed her so ravenously that it left her dizzy when he suddenly broke away. He didn’t say goodbye; he only turned without a word and made his way to the elevator.</p><p>The thread that bound them together drew taut as he walked away. It created an ache in her chest that she knew she’d never be rid of.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>“Miss Hermione is back!” exclaimed Piksy, clapping her hands joyfully. “Here is your post, Miss. Piksy wants you to open it now! She’s been waiting all week.”</p><p>Hermione cocked a brow. “Why now?”</p><p>“Because it's from <em> Witch Weekly </em>!”</p><p>Hermione’s eyebrows furrowed. “Oh.” She took the stack of letters from Piksy’s tiny hands and looked at the one sitting on top. Sure enough, it was sent from the magazine, <em> Witch Weekly </em>.</p><p>She tore it open and her eyes slid back and forth as she read its contents.</p><p>Piksy hopped from one foot to the next, her golden eyes shining like bright moons. “What does it say?”</p><p>Hermione smiled. “I guess they’ve chosen me as <em> Witch of the Year </em>. They want to run an article about me for the January issue.”</p><p>Piksy’s high-pitched squeal nearly gave Hermione a heart attack. “Mistress is Witch of the Year! You’ll be on the very front cover!”</p><p>Hermione grinned as she got a brilliant idea. “Piksy, would you like to come and pose with me for the centerfold?”</p><p>She hadn’t thought it possible for Piksy’s eyes to get any bigger, but they grew as big as saucers. “Me? Piksy is not worthy to be photographed in a Witch’s magazine!”</p><p>“Of course you are, don’t be silly,” Hermione huffed. “I’ll write them back today.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Hermione woke bright and early on Tuesday morning. She read back over the letters from the publishers that Tom had given her, and she narrowed it down between Obscurus Books (which had published the popular <em> Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them </em> ) and Whizz Hard Books, (which had published <em> Quidditch Through the Ages) </em> . Both publishers had offices in Diagon Alley, so she set appointments with them. They were each purveyors of popular titles, but Hermione wanted to assure herself that whatever contract she signed would be on her own terms. Otherwise, she would keep her name <em> and </em>her spellbook to herself.</p><p>Hermione then got dressed and took up her interview notes, determined to go into work and finish her article, no matter how much she dreaded finishing it. She was honor bound to professionalism, although she wasn’t sure that she wouldn’t take the opportunity to cast a negative light on the Minister if she came across one. She wouldn’t do it on purpose, but she did have quite a few questions about the woman’s platform and stance on certain issues. Wilhelmina Tuft had an intriguing way of diverting attention away from important issues, even completely glossing over some topics, while leaving people charmed and dazed. Hermione thought it pointed to ulterior motives, but she wasn’t entirely sure yet.</p><p>Hermione apparated to Diagon Alley and grabbed her tea from the newsstand, as she always did. Then, she made her way to the Daily Prophet, to the second floor newsroom. Her heels clicked against the hardwood as she walked to her desk. She happened to notice clusters of writers, editors, copywriters, interns, and even the Prophet photographers, all whispering in various groupings around the room. </p><p>Hermione’s brows furrowed in confusion, but she continued on purposefully to her desk and sat her notes down. She took a deep drink of her tea and got to work. She looked through the window just in time to catch sight of Tom taking his usual route to Borgin &amp; Burkes. He crossed the street and stopped at the newsstand, grabbed his paper and coffee, then turned and looked directly at her window. She bit her lip as he lowered his head and began to enter Knockturn Alley.</p><p>“Hermione.”</p><p>She turned to find her closest friend, Eulessia Baron, standing by her desk and looking very grave indeed.</p><p>“Good morning,” Hermione said cheerily. “What is it? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”</p><p>“Um, well,” said Eulessia under her breath. “Baumgartner’s gone.”</p><p>Hermione’s brows furrowed. “<em> What </em>? What do you mean?”</p><p>Eulessia seemed nervous. “Well… he’s resigned… and he’s already been replaced.”</p><p>Hermione sat in complete shock. “Since when?”</p><p>“Since this morning I suppose.”</p><p>Hermione’s mouth dropped open. “But he was only <em>just</em> talking to me before I left for Paris! He said he would talk to me when I got back about another assignment he was going to give me. Didn’t he tell anybody he was leaving?”</p><p>Eulessia shook her head. She appeared entirely out of sorts. </p><p>Hermione sat for a moment, her eyes sliding back and forth as she contemplated the news. “Who’s replaced him?”</p><p>Eulessia gulped. “I think she wants to see you. It’s Diana Carrow.” </p><p>Hermione’s lips parted. She felt like she’d just been punched in the gut. “Carrow…”</p><p>Her friend nodded. </p><p>“Where… where’s Baumgartner gone to? Why did he resign?”</p><p>Eulessia took a deep breath. “Nobody knows. No one has heard from him. Only his family members still left in Britain say he’s gone abroad. To America.”</p><p>Hermione’s eyebrows furrowed. Something wasn’t right.</p><p>She lowered her voice to a whisper. “Wasn’t… er- wasn’t Diana Carrow’s sister an acolyte of Grindelwald?”</p><p>Eulessia looked around nervously and then nodded.</p><p>The entire newsroom was buzzing with the news, but it wasn’t a happy atmosphere. It was a dark cloud of dread.</p><p>Kogrod waddled up to Hermione’s desk with a smug smirk on his face. “The new editor-in-chief would like a word with you, Dumbledore.”</p><p>Eulessia and Hermione exchanged glances. Hermione stood up and walked to the back of the newsroom where the door to the editor-in-chief’s office was. The nameplate on the door had already been changed. It read “Diana M. Carrow, Editor-in-Chief.”</p><p>Hermione swallowed, and then knocked.</p><p>The door opened magically, and Hermione entered. </p><p>The office had changed dramatically, seemingly overnight. The photos of Baumgartner’s family, his awards and certificates, the photographs of him with various political figures and famous witches and wizards were all gone. </p><p>Even the chair had changed. The office was now dark and cold, decorated in green, silver, and black. There were Slytherin house banners, photographs of Diana with the Yaxleys and Flints, and a photo of her with a younger woman whom Hermione assumed was her sister. That sister was now imprisoned in Nurmengard. </p><p>“Welcome, Mrs. Dumbledore. Happy New Year. Please have a seat.”</p><p>Hermione sat. “Where is Baumgartner?”</p><p>The woman’s red lips curved into a smile. She was blonde, and her hair was cut short and styled in elegant fingerwaves, like a golden helmet on her head. Hermione thought to herself that they were dreadfully out of style, by about twenty years at least. Her teeth were also slightly yellowed, and Hermione cringed, thankful that her parents had been dentists. She always got compliments on her teeth, which was something she’d not been prepared for in 1948. Dental hygiene was woefully behind the times in the wizarding world. </p><p>“Your previous editor has chosen to retire. I was contacted by the owners of the <em> Prophet </em> and hired on the spot.” She grinned smugly. “New Year, new paper.”</p><p>“I see,” Hermione said, feeling disturbed. “Did he say why he was leaving?”</p><p>The witch shook her head. </p><p>“Forgive me, but… are you qualified for this job, Miss Carrow?”</p><p>The witch gave a haughty chuckle, and it sounded like a sucking noise coming from the back of her throat. “Why, I’ve worked for Whizz Hard Books for years! Just up the street, actually. I'm very familiar with the editing process, my dear.”</p><p>Hermione decided right then and there to publish through Obscurus Books, no matter what.</p><p>“Now, while you’re here, Hermione, I must inform you that there are to be some changes here at the <em> Prophet </em> . Some of your articles are, well… very politically forward. <em> Progressive, </em> I should say. I’ve spoken with the owners of the paper and they are in agreement that we should perhaps go in a more politically correct direction. More middle of the road. More <em> inclusive</em>.”</p><p>“<em>Inclusive</em>?” Hermione nearly shouted, the incredulity apparent in her voice. “How much more inclusive could I be?”</p><p>Diana’s chin lifted a notch and her brow smoothed. She stared at Hermione with hardened green eyes. “We must aim to be inclusive of <em> all </em> political views, whether or not they align with our own. That being said, I will have you run your ideas by me first… all of them. In this way, there will be accountability. I’ll make the final judgment on whether your proposals match the spirit which the <em> Prophet </em> hopes to progress to in the coming year. At times, I will choose your assignments for you… and I will be reading every article before it goes to print.”</p><p>Hermione blinked several times. </p><p>Something wasn’t right.</p><p>“So you’re going to… censor me? That’s what you’re saying.”</p><p>She gave Hermione a patient, somewhat condescending smile. “Don’t think of it as censorship, my dear. Consider it more of a <em> guiding hand</em>.”</p><p>Hermione’s heart began to beat very quickly. Her mind was beginning to catch up to the events that had occurred. </p><p>Baumgartner hadn’t retired. He’d not gone to America.</p><p>He hadn’t said a word about such things to anyone at the paper. </p><p>Hermione knew for certain that there was foul play, and she would set to work to prove it. Could Wilhelmina Tuft have been behind this? It was entirely possible. She’d certainly voiced her dislike for Hermione’s writings during the interview.</p><p>Someone didn’t want Hermione writing her articles. She just needed to find out who.</p><p>“Where did Baumgartner go in America?”</p><p>Diana Carrow blinked. “How would I know?”</p><p><em> Because he didn’t go to America</em>, Hermione thought.</p><p>She swallowed. She feared something terrible had happened to him. </p><p>Suddenly, her blood ran ice cold as a thought crossed her mind.</p><p><em> No</em>, she thought. <em> He wouldn’t do something like this to me. </em></p><p>But Tom’s words echoed in her mind. </p><p>
<em> If you won’t stop writing these articles, then I will find a way to stop you. And you will not like it. </em>
</p><p>Hermione’s lips parted. </p><p>She stood abruptly, her heart pounding violently in her chest. </p><p>“I quit,” she breathed softly. </p><p>Diana’s eyebrows shot up. “Excuse me?”</p><p>Hermione gritted her teeth, her breathing growing shallow. Then she lifted her chin, and said more loudly, “I said, I quit. Good day to you, Miss Carrow.”</p><p>And at that, she turned and left the office. She crossed to her desk and took up her notes, with the eyes of the entire newsroom upon her, and she quietly left the <em>Daily Prophet</em>. </p><p>Then, Hermione walked directly across the street and rounded the corner, making her way toward Knockturn Alley.</p>

<p> </p><p>
<span>Hermione stomped her way down Knockturn Alley, bypassing hags and vampires, brushing past werewolves, shoving aside shady wizards with no regard for her safety or her direction, because she was seeing red.</span>
</p><p>
<span>How </span>
<em>
<span>dare</span>
</em>
<span> he do this to her?</span>
</p><p>
<span>It couldn’t be true. Not after Paris…</span>
</p><p>
<span>She passed by Noggin &amp; Bonce (shrunken heads), Cobb &amp; Webb’s (a dark arts shop), The Coffin House (for necromancers), Postage’s Cauldrons, Trackleshank’s Locksmith, Shyverwretch’s Venoms and Poison, and the Spiny Serpent. She’d forgotten that Borgin and Burkes was located at the opposite end of Knockturn Alley. Tom’s flat was at the very front of the alleyway, so she never had to venture far into its depths.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The further she got, the creepier the place felt. She passed a shop that sold bones, and another that sold bats and skins. She passed by Mr. Mulpepper’s Apothecary, The Starry Prophesier (a rubbish, farcical medium’s practice), and then finally, The White Wyvern, a disreputable pub where even the aurors dared not to look too deeply. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Finally, she stood before the entrance to Borgin and Burkes. She hadn’t been here since she, Ron, and Harry had followed Draco there in sixth year. Its windows were filled with enchanted items and antiques, and the same skeleton that had appeared in its window in the future was there now. Not much had changed. She gazed up at the sign, which read “Borgin &amp; Burkes, Established 1803, Licensed Auctioneers.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She wasted no time in opening the door and stepping into the dimly lit shop. A raven which sat in the window crowed at her arrival. Hermione looked around and saw no one in the shop. It was still rather early, so Tom could be in the back doing inventory.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her hackles rose by simply being in the shop. It reminded her of Draco and Lucius, and the vanishing cabinet that had led Death Eaters into Hogwarts. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Tom’s</span>
</em>
<span> death eaters.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was Voldemort who’d sent Draco to kill Dumbledore; he’d sent a young boy on a suicide mission.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There were masks hung on the walls. Hermione could feel the dark magic leaching from them. In one section of the shop, there were crystal balls, ouija boards, scrying mirrors, and other divining paraphernalia. In a glass display, there were bones of all sorts. The kind that were only used in rituals of dark magic. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione swallowed as she imagined Tom arranging them in the case.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There were poisonous candles, ingredients for dangerous draughts and potions, cursed articles of clothing and jewelry, a hangman’s rope, and a strange glass eye that followed Hermione as she walked through the shop. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She’d just about seen enough and was about to call out for him when Tom walked through a back door behind the shop desk. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When he saw her, he froze. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Their eyes locked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione glared at Tom, her anger seething through the coldness of her gaze. </span>
</p><p>
<span>He blinked twice, but otherwise, his face was a blank mask. “I told you I would write to you on the parchment, Hermione.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The </span>
<em>
<span>nerve</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She took a step forward, her anger pulling her toward him. “What did you do, Tom?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He took a deep breath. “Hermione…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Where</span>
</em>
<span> is my editor?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He held out a hand as if to calm her. “Can we talk about this tonight? I’m at work right now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He exhaled. “Hermione…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You fucked with </span>
<em>
<span>my </span>
</em>
<span>work, so I’m going to fuck with yours.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He ran his tongue over his teeth. “I suppose that’s fair.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So you did do it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course.” He said it so casually, as if it were the most natural thing in the world for him to disappear her employer. It made her stomach turn.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He crossed the shop and locked the front door, then switched the sign from “open” to “closed.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, he turned to face her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione’s chest heaved as they stood watching one another, sizing one another up. “Did you kill him?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Where is he, Tom?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“On a long trip, love.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Don’t</span>
</em>
<span> call me that,” she snapped.</span>
</p><p>
<span>His eyes narrowed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She wanted to curse him. For the first time in her life, she wanted to use the </span>
<em>
<span>cruciatus</span>
</em>
<span>. “Why are you like this, Tom? Why do you think it’s okay to do this to me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>His head jerked to the side as he took a step forward, his composure snapping. “I’m </span>
<em>
<span>protecting </span>
</em>
<span>you, Hermione, because you won’t fucking protect yourself.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her eyes bugged out. “I don’t need your </span>
<em>
<span>shitty </span>
</em>
<span>brand of protection, or whatever the hell you’re calling it!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s what you think, little witch, because you’ve no idea how many enemies you’re making.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Who? Your death eaters?” She scoffed and gave him a venomous smirk. “Thought you had a better leash on them than that, but I guess not.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He glared at her. “I can’t control every blasted pureblood in Britain, Hermione. Not yet anyway. Besides, you were an inch away from having your entire reputation blown to fucking smithereens.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her brow furrowed. “What are you talking about?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“A photo of you, at my flat, was almost sent to </span>
<em>
<span>all </span>
</em>
<span>the papers. I made a deal. I’d stop you from writing your bloody articles, in exchange for not sending the photo. I suppose I could’ve killed them instead, but since </span>
<em>
<span>murder</span>
</em>
<span> is so </span>
<em>
<span>distasteful</span>
</em>
<span> to you, my dear, I chose to take the deal instead.” He jerked his cigarettes from his robes. As he shoved one between his lips, he muttered, “I probably will kill them, though.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione shook her head in disbelief. “So I’m supposed to believe that none of this has anything to do with you or your death eaters?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He lit his cigarette with a wave of his hand and then scowled. “It really doesn’t, but could you blame me if it did? Do you honestly think you can just fight me at every turn and I’d sit back and do nothing?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Bring him back,” she gritted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” he muttered firmly as he expelled smoke from his lungs. The room was dim as the sky outside darkened with an impending storm, diminishing the meager light that the windows provided.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She’d had enough. In a split second, she had her wand out and she yelled, “Crucio!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She had caught Tom off guard. The instant her curse went forth, he fell to his knees. He didn’t scream, but his mouth fell open, the cords of his throat bulging with the intensity of the pain. He tried to reach for his wand, but his hands instead rose involuntarily to his temples, clutching and clawing at his head as he doubled over in agony.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A moment later, she released him. </span>
</p><p>
<span>He fell to his hands, his chest heaving with his laborious breathing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s wrong, Tom? I thought that was your favorite curse.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He stood after a moment, straightening his jacket as he glared at her with narrowed eyes. He had his wand in his hand. “I told you at Riddle House, little witch, never to try and curse me again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione smirked. “Oh, I didn’t </span>
<em>
<span>try</span>
</em>
<span>, Tom. I succeeded.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He lifted his wand but Hermione was quick. They stood mere feet from one another, wands raised. The intensity of his gaze could have cut her open like a blade. His cigarette still lay on the floor, smoking where he’d dropped it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Bring him back, Tom.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not unless you leave the </span>
<em>
<span>Prophet</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her lips parted, her delicate features twisting into a look of disgust. “You just want to control me, like you control your death eaters… like you control </span>
<em>
<span>everything</span>
</em>
<span> in your life!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, Hermione,” he bit out. “I want to </span>
<em>
<span>protect</span>
</em>
<span> you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“By controlling me!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom dropped his wand and moved forward in powerful strides. He gripped Hermione by the arm and jerked her against him, but she tore away. He moved as if to take her in his arms, but she fought him, kicking and dragging her nails down his face and chest. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck, witch!” He wrestled with her, but she was completely feral with rage. “Stop this, Hermione.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She conjured a blade and brought it down, but he snatched her wrist aside in the same movement, his eyes widening as they met hers. “What the hell do you think you’re doing?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>He shook the knife from her hand and then slammed her against the wall, pinning her there beneath his weight as she fought him with all the wrath of an infuriated manticore. He held her there until she gave out, breathless, cheeks red, hair mussed, eyes snapping with hatred.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Fuck you, Tom!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You meant that torture curse, Hermione. I could </span>
<em>
<span>feel</span>
</em>
<span> it.” His black eyes glittered in the dim light. “I’ve long wondered if you had it in you, darling. The </span>
<em>
<span>darkness</span>
</em>
<span>. It’s in you like it’s in me. I want to bring it out of you. I want to make you </span>
<em>
<span>stronger</span>
</em>
<span>. Stop fighting me.” He ran his nose along her temple as she struggled against his hold. “We could be so powerful together, Hermione. You’re more valuable to me than any of my death eaters. I would <em>burn</em> <em>them all</em> in fiendfyre for you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let me go, Tom,” she spat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You did this, Hermione.  I never said I would fight fair. You’ve come after me, in your words and your papers and your articles. You seek to undermine me. You spread your poison against me in the ministry. And I’ve let you. You started this war, and you’re bloody daft if you thought I wouldn’t fight you back at some point. But here, Hermione… here, there is only this.” He gripped her thighs and spread them roughly to push his hips against hers. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“This is our truce. Our no man’s land. Here, there is only us, and our magic, and our bodies coming together. I lay it all aside for you, all of your betrayal and the </span>
<em>
<span>knife</span>
</em>
<span> you twist in my back. I occlude it to the most distant place in my mind. Here, you’re </span>
<em>
<span>mine</span>
</em>
<span>. All of you, every part. Here, I can show you how powerful you are, how you bring me to my knees. Here, I can worship you, I can bring you so much pleasure that you scream my name. This is all I can think about during my days. Every day, Hermione, I pray to a God I don’t believe in that we don’t </span>
<em>
<span>destroy</span>
</em>
<span> one another, so that I can have just one more night buried inside you. Every morning, I wake up to the reality that you want to rip me to pieces and everything I’ve worked so hard for… and every night I try to hold tight to the feel of you in my arms, as if I could cast </span>
<em>
<span>stasis</span>
</em>
<span> on us and keep us that way forever.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you even understand what you do to me, Hermione? My ambition has always been some cold thing, like a piece of marble that I could mold and manipulate. Something that was mine, but also separate from me. But </span>
<em>
<span>you </span>
</em>
<span>- you’re like a </span>
<em>
<span>fucking </span>
</em>
<span>itch somewhere that I can’t reach. You’re </span>
<em>
<span>inside</span>
</em>
<span> me and it’s maddening.  </span>
<em>
<span>I want you</span>
</em>
<span>. More than I’ve ever wanted anything in my life. You make me feel ill, witch. I want to own you, to </span>
<em>
<span>devour</span>
</em>
<span> you whole. I want to be your wizard, and your lover, and your teacher. I feel like I’m tearing my own flesh from my bones just to possess you, to </span>
<em>
<span>keep</span>
</em>
<span> you. In truth, Hermione… you’re driving me </span>
<em>
<span>fucking mad</span>
</em>
<span>." His voice rose to a near shout, his frustration spilling over in a way she'd never seen before. "I’ve never feared </span>
<em>
<span>anything</span>
</em>
<span> like I fear you. I fear </span>
<em>
<span>losing </span>
</em>
<span>this. But more than that, I fear losing </span>
<em>
<span>you </span>
</em>
<span>and being trapped here without you, permanently bound to this earth with no hope of retrieving you from whatever comes after this. So yes, I will control you, if it means I can protect you. I would fucking chain you up if I knew you wouldn’t despise me for it. I’ve wished I could slice open your fucking head and examine your brain to see what it is about you that makes me so fucking </span>
<em>
<span>weak</span>
</em>
<span>. I </span>
<em>
<span>love</span>
</em>
<span> you.” At this admission, his handsome face twisted into an expression that was many things all at once: fearful, wild, angry, and desperate. He was suddenly reduced to the orphan boy who had never been allowed to own anything, and who had suddenly discovered something he wanted to own more than anything in the world. “I love you, Hermione, and I don’t think… I don’t think I’m capable of doing it properly.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Despite this shocking speech, which Hermione hadn’t had time to process yet, she spoke, her voice laced with poison and anger. “It’s pretty simple, really, Tom. Don’t disappear my friends and co-workers. Don’t </span>
<em>
<span>murder </span>
</em>
<span>innocent people. That would be a bloody start.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Innocence is subjective, Hermione. Are we going to have a conversation about morals? Because I care more about your safety than I do any set of ethics.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What if the roles were reversed, Tom? What if I’d done this to you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Anger snapped in his black eyes. “You already have been! Do you not realize that this whole war you’ve started, fighting me with your articles, spouting your noble ideals and condemning my followers is just a way to show me how much better you are than me? To try to get me to change my ways?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione scoffed. “I know you would never do that for me. I’m not completely delusional.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom gritted his teeth. “You consistently underestimate how I feel about you, little witch, and it's become exhausting.” He glared at her, shaking his head. “There has to be a reason you’re doing this. You’re targeting me in </span>
<em>
<span>everything</span>
</em>
<span> you do. Why?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t believe in your cause, Tom. It’s wrong.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That isn’t it.” He pointed his finger at her, seething in anger. “You know there is legitimate truth in at least some of my beliefs. You’ve even said as much. Perhaps, you don’t like my methods, but I truthfully don’t see any other way to accomplish what needs to be done. I would be open to hearing you out, if you thought there was a better way. But I </span>
<em>
<span>know</span>
</em>
<span> there’s more to this, Hermione. Tell me what it is you’re keeping from me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione stood staring at him. His black eyes swallowed her whole, and she saw nothing but pain in them. She wished she trusted him, but she couldn’t. In his emotional state, his potent magic had begun to leak out of him, shifting them both into a dark atmosphere not unlike the terror imposed by dementors. It seemed to change the very colors in the room, casting the shop in grayscale. “I don’t have to tell you anything. You don’t deserve it after what you've done. You’ll have to take it from my mind.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom stared at her, his eyes roaming her face, but there was no anger in them, only desperation and longing. He swallowed, his adam’s apple bobbing as he muttered softly, “I won’t do that, Hermione. I just want you to trust me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She shook her head in disbelief. “I can’t trust you, Tom. You destroy everything you touch.” Her eyes darted back and forth, searching his face. “You </span>
<em>
<span>frighten </span>
</em>
<span>me, Tom. It’s like you give in to your intrusive thoughts.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He stared at her, his expression dark. “You’re right about that, little witch. Except that you’re my only intrusive thought. You intrude into my thoughts over and over, and I give in every time.” His jaw muscles flexed as he lifted his hand and brushed his knuckles against her cheek. He released his breath, then whispered, “Hermione…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t say it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He cocked his head in irritation. “Why? Because you think you won’t be able to leave me if I do? I know that’s what you plan to do. If not today, then eventually.” He leaned closer, until his breath fell against the shell of her ear. “But you’ll never escape me, Hermione Granger. I intend to haunt you, because you haunt me. You have since the moment I met you. You won’t be able to sleep without my arms around you. You’ll crave me between your thighs while you ache with loneliness, no matter who else you take into your bed.” He exhaled sharply, as if he’d been holding his breath. “Don’t say it? I don’t have to. I’ve shown you in a million ways. I’ve branded myself into you deeper than any rune. You couldn’t even cut me out with a knife… because I’m in your soul, darling.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione’s lips parted and she sucked in a jagged breath. One tear rolled down her cheek. Then, her mouth snapped shut. She reached between them and grabbed his hand, placing hers over it as she whispered, “I love you, too, Tom. It frightens me how much I love you." She released his hand. "But I won’t be controlled by you. That’s not love.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She extricated herself from his grasp and he let her go. His face melted back into a smooth, emotionless mask as he watched her walk away. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“By the way,” she added. “I’m going to put every single one of your death eaters in Azkaban. So you’d better train them well.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She unlocked the door of the shop and left.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom stood in shock, gazing after her. He felt something cold in his hand, and he looked down, uncurling his fingers to find his black and gold Gaunt ring in his palm. </span>
</p><p>
<span>He blinked several times as he stared at it. Then he closed his eyes, releasing his breath sharply through his nose. Then he jerked and threw it violently across the room.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>Gaspard entered his office and closed the door. He winced as he fell into his seat. He was nursing bruised ribs and a gruesome cut along his shoulder. The on-duty healer had tended to it, but there was no hurrying the slow healing process involved with enchanted blades.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He sighed as he leaned back in his chair, then he winced as even his breathing caused him pain. He ran his fingers through his hair as he stared up at the ceiling. Another successful raid. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It still didn’t make him feel any better about Hausler being out, roaming free in the world again. He had no leads. He doubted the dark wizard was even still in Britain. </span>
</p><p>
<span>He ran his hand over his face as he contemplated. How could this young boy, Tom Riddle, have been the one to break him out? The boy was only twenty-two years of age. Surely, he couldn’t be that powerful. Azkaban had never been breached. It was too ludicrous to believe.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He’d put tabs on every individual who came into contact with Riddle on a regular basis. Gaspard had spies in every area of the ministry, and received consistent reports on their activities and conversations.</span>
</p><p>
<span>If there was indeed a sleeper cell of dark wizards in London, Dufresne intended to uncover them. He’d given thought to a possible sting, or a trap he could lay. His instincts always served him well. He trusted that the idea would come to him in due time. Until then, he would observe carefully.</span>
</p><p>
<span>On his desk were two wands, belonging to the wizards they’d apprehended during the raid. He needed another auror as a witness before he could perform </span>
<em>
<span>priori incantatem.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Just as he was about to page Bones, there was a knock at his door. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What is it?” he called.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The door opened and Peoria Parkinson poked her head in. “Mr. Dufresne? You have a visitor.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>His brows furrowed. “I don’t have any appointments today, and I’m not receiving any visitors.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sir, I’m sorry, but… it’s Miss Dumbledore. Shall I tell her to make an appointment?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He cocked his head. “Hermione Dumbledore?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He sighed. “Send her in.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The door closed. His brows furrowed as he tried to decipher the reason for her visit. Perhaps she’d heard about the raid and wanted to write about it. She always had an infuriating way of finding out things that should’ve been kept secret. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The door opened, and Hermione entered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Gaspard stood involuntarily as she came in, then winced as he felt a sharp pain in his ribs and shoulder. He gestured to the seat in front of him. “Have a seat, Hermione.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’d rather stand.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He watched her, his curiosity peaked. She seemed a bit out of sorts.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Gaspard,” she began. “Is the auror position still available?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He gazed at her, but decided it was best for the time being not to ask questions. “Please,” he muttered as he extended his hand to the chair in front of him. “Have a seat, and we’ll talk.”</span>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>“Why do you want to be an auror?”</p><p>Hermione sighed. “Is this a trick question? Have I made a mistake in coming here?”</p><p>Gaspard stared at her blankly, only betraying a hint of annoyance in his otherwise unreadable eyes. “Answer the bloody question, Dumbledore.”</p><p>She took a deep breath. “I suppose, because I want to catch dark wizards, as you could probably tell by my writings of late. I have a bit of a vendetta against them. But also… I suppose I want to prove something to myself.”</p><p>Gaspard cocked his head, observing her. “I think you’ve proven yourself, Hermione. No need to go out and put yourself in danger for vanity’s sake.”</p><p>“It’s certainly not <em>vanity</em>.” She pursed her lips. “I’m going to stand and walk back out that door if you condescend to me again.”</p><p>Gaspard stared at her thoughtfully. “I’m not trying to condescend to you. I’m trying to tell you that you’re quite impressive enough without needing to add “auror” to your list of accomplishments. This job is quite involved, and it will require a hefty time commitment. I don't want to assume, but you do seem to have quite a bit on your plate.”</p><p>Hermione heaved an exasperated breath. “You did offer me a job, did you not? I must’ve been imagining that you almost seemed to want me here.”</p><p>“I do want you here. To train a witch such as yourself would be a dream come true for me and this department. I just want to be sure that your motivations are in the right place before I put a great deal of time and effort into you.”</p><p>Hermione’s eyebrows lifted sharply. “Believe it or not, I <em>have</em> thought this through at length since you mentioned it months ago. I don’t do things out of impulse, although my hand was somewhat forced, I will admit.”</p><p>Gaspard’s brows furrowed. “What do you mean?”</p><p>She bit her lip. “My editor-in-chief at the <em> Prophet </em> was replaced. By someone who doesn’t like my articles in the slightest. So… rather than be censored, I quit.”</p><p>Gaspard blinked several times. “I see. So you showed up on my doorstep?”</p><p>“I’d already been thinking about it, Gaspard, I assure you." She heaved another deep sigh. "Do I have a job or not?”</p><p>He stared at Hermione, watching her carefully. </p><p>Of all the wizards she had met, he possessed the most immaculate poker face she’d ever seen. </p><p>Tom was different. He put on faces like he put on ties. He could be charming, suspicious, arrogant, pensive, even playful. He had a million faces and they all arrested her.</p><p>But Gaspard was a blank canvas. His eyes were piercing but windowless, and his expression betrayed nothing of his thoughts or emotions. To be honest, he unnerved her in an entirely different manner than Riddle did. </p><p>Hermione overcompensated for that by being difficult.</p><p>“I’m going to warn you, Hermione. There will be no special treatment, no matter what our relationship is or has been, and no matter what my friendship with your father might be.”</p><p>She looked taken aback. “Why would I expect anything different?”</p><p>“You’ll have to be tested. Then, you’ll go through the same training program as all of my aurors, and it is quite rigorous, be forewarned. It typically takes years for my aurors to be sent out into the really dangerous work, and you are <em> quite </em> young, so I’ll have to observe you closely. If I deem that you are not ready to be sent out, you’ll have to abide by that.” His jaw muscles tensed. “I will treat you like everyone else in this department. I expect every rule to be followed.”</p><p>She nodded. “Of course.”</p><p>“When you’re working, you’ll refer to me as Mr. Dufresne. I will refer to you as Miss Dumbledore.”</p><p>Hermione fought a smirk. “Of course, Mr. Dufresne.”</p><p>He took a deep breath. “You’ve been rather difficult with me in the past. I hope that trend won’t follow you into your position as an auror.”</p><p>Hermione shook her head incredulously. “I was doing my <em> job</em>, sir. As a reporter, my <em> job </em> is to be difficult and get answers. Or rather, it <em> was</em>. I hope you won’t hold it against me.”</p><p>He looked taken aback by her words. “Of course not, Hermione. I think your tenacity will serve you well as an auror. I just have to establish the rules of professionalism up front. I do this with every auror that I train.”</p><p>She nodded. “Then I’m excited to get started.”</p><p>“Not every recruit makes it through training. I’d say maybe… fifteen percent of my hires make it through to earn their badge.”</p><p>“Lovely,” she said wryly.</p><p>“Once you pass the character and aptitude tests, there’s a series of courses you’ll be required to take and pass. Typically this training takes three years. However… <em>hypothetically</em>, if you were able to pass the testing required, we may be able to expedite your training.”</p><p>“How quickly?”</p><p>“That all depends on you. Could be a year, possibly a few months if you do extremely well, but that would be rather remarkable.”</p><p>Hermione smiled to herself, her eyes darting back and forth as she lost herself in thought.</p><p>Gaspard’s eyes narrowed. “You’re taking that as a challenge, aren’t you?”</p><p>Hermione sobered and her smile faded. “No,” she muttered, lifting her chin. “Though I <em> would </em> like to bypass a three-year training program, if possible.”</p><p>He rubbed his chin. “Is this a long-term commitment for you, Dumbledore? Or is it just a passing fancy?”</p><p>“<em>Of course not</em>. What else am I going to do? I think I'm auror material, as you've already stated yourself. Why are you giving me a hard time?”</p><p>He looked at her with crystalline blue eyes, but they were emotionless. “You’ve seemed to have kept quite busy since you dropped into Britain last year.”</p><p>“I like to keep busy.”</p><p>“When would you like to start?”</p><p>Hermione swallowed. She desperately wanted to keep herself occupied. The busier she was, the less she would have to think about Riddle. She wanted to be so exhausted come nightfall that she wouldn’t miss his absence. </p><p>“As soon as possible.”</p><p>Gaspard gave a curt nod. “Come in tomorrow then. You’ll begin your testing with Mr. Bones. He’s just been promoted to Head of the Auror department as our previous head has retired. You’ll be working with him for the majority of your testing and training.”</p><p>“Oh,” she murmured. “I hoped I’d be training with you.”</p><p>Gaspard met her gaze, his expression almost betraying shock, then cleared his throat. “I’m Head of the entire DMLE, Hermione. That’s not typically my duty. This is the largest department of the Ministry. Not only that, but all other Ministry departments answer to me, with the exception of the Department of Mysteries. I have a lot of moving parts to oversee.”</p><p>Hermione was aware of this. She also knew that many of the DMLE Heads went on to be elected Minister, as it was considered to be the highest position next to Minister for Magic.  During her time, both Bartemius Crouch, Sr. and Pius Thicknesse had been Head of the DMLE, and Thicknesse did go on to become Minister, whereas Crouch would have also been elected, had he not been murdered by his son.</p><p>She nodded. “I understand.”</p><p>He watched her with penetrating blue eyes. “I will try to be as involved as I possibly can be.”</p><p>“What does the testing entail?”</p><p>He sat forward, running his tongue over his top teeth as he contemplated. “I’m not allowed to give you forewarning about the details and intricacies of the testing. However, I can tell you that there will be a written portion, a psychological analysis by a mind healer, a basic dueling assessment, a physical examination, and a truth test.”</p><p>Hermione’s eyebrows shot up. “A truth test?”</p><p>He nodded. “We employ the use of veritaserum, as we do with interrogations.”</p><p>Hermione froze. Her lips parted, and she blinked several times before she said slowly, “What kinds of questions are going to be asked?”</p><p>He cocked his head. “I can’t tell you that, Dumbledore. Is there a problem with that?” His eyes were suspicious.</p><p>She swallowed. “Erm… no. It’s just… well, there’s some things that my father would rather not have known.”</p><p>He gazed at her for several moments. “The results of the testing are confidential.”</p><p>She bit her lip. “Still… I think I should talk with Dumbledore, first.”</p><p>His eyes narrowed as he observed her curiously. His jaw tensed, and he inclined his head. “Do what you need to do, but otherwise, I’ll assume you’re starting tomorrow.”</p><p>She swallowed, then nodded. “Tomorrow.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Dumbledore sat in his office, pouring over memories in his pensieve. He was examining his memories of Tom Riddle, attempting to piece together a puzzle which was somehow just beyond his grasp. What was he missing?</p><p>He'd been so preoccupied with the threat that Grindelwald presented to the magical world, that he hadn't paid much thought nor attention to Tom.</p><p>Threats seemed to be multiplying like Doxies of late.</p><p>Just as he was emerging from a memory of Riddle in his classroom in the boy’s fifth year, he heard a knock on his office door.</p><p>He lifted his wand and flicked it. The heavy wooden door opened with a creak. </p><p>“Albus?” He recognized Hermione’s voice, and it brought warmth to his chest.</p><p>He turned with a smile. “Good evening, Miss Granger.” He took the top off of a tin of candies and held it out. “Bertie Bott’s?”</p><p>Hermione smiled and walked into the office, then retrieved one from the tin. “Here goes nothing.” She winced as she popped a bean in her mouth. Then, she grinned, pleasantly surprised. “Licorice.”</p><p>He chuckled as he drew one out of the tin and threw it into his mouth. A second later, he shook his head and shivered in repulsion. “I suspect toejam or manticore’s breath.”</p><p>Hermione giggled and crossed the room to where Fawkes and Seraphina sat, side by side, upon a perch. They slept peacefully, but upon being approached by Hermione, Seraphina opened one eye and cooed happily. Hermione stroked the bird’s golden feathers. </p><p>“To what do I owe this visit, Miss Granger?”</p><p>Hermione sighed. “No need to call me by my surname anymore, Albus. I feel that life is leagues behind me now.”</p><p>Dumbledore turned his keen gaze on her, his interest piqued by her somber tone.</p><p>She looked up and their eyes met. </p><p>“Well, I might as well come out with it all, Albus. I’m no longer seeing Tom Riddle. I don’t feel like talking about it either. I’ve also quit my job at the<em> Daily Prophet</em>. There’s a new editor-in-chief and we don’t see eye to eye. It seems to have run its course, in any case.” She sighed as his eyebrows rose. “Gaspard Dufresne has offered me a position as an auror, provided that I pass the initial testing. I… I would like to accept, but… there’s a truth test using veritaserum. I have no idea what questions will be asked.” She chewed her inner lip. “What should I do?”</p><p>Dumbledore eyed her thoughtfully. “Are you quite sure you want to be an auror, Hermione?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>He nodded, then took a deep breath. “I suppose I should come down to the Ministry with you, then, and have a talk with Gaspard. We are good friends, and I may be able to help you keep your cover intact. When are these tests taking place?”</p><p>“Tomorrow.”</p><p>“Very well, Hermione,” he replied. “I will go with you to the DMLE tomorrow and speak with Gaspard. We can work something out, I’m sure. Although, I may need to inform him of the nature of your arrival here. I would rather not, but it may be unavoidable. Still, Gaspard is one of the few people that I would trust with my life.” His eyes sparkled with mirth. “He is a stickler for following the rules. Always has been, even as a student of mine. Very rigid and militant… rather like a soldier. A trait that makes him very good at his job. However, in some instances, it is necessary, even for the most <em>unyielding</em> among us… to fudge the rules.” Dumbledore winked.</p><p>“You’ve a criminal mind, Albus.”</p><p>He chuckled. “I think what most people fail to realize about me, daughter, is that I’ve always been a <em>dark</em> wizard. I simply chose the light, when it was all said and done. But you can never take the darkness permanently out of a dark wizard. It likes to rear its ugly head at the most inopportune times... That is why I've always made a point to surround myself with people who remind me to always choose the light, and to choose to do good, even when it appears to be wrong.” His expression grew sober. “I do hope your Riddle will one day choose light, as well.”</p><p>Hermione’s eyes fell. “He’s not my Riddle… not anymore.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Tom laid on his bed, staring at the ceiling. He felt entirely gutted.</p><p>He’d written Hermione on the parchment, but she hadn’t written back. He’d astral projected his soul into her flat to check on her, but she hadn’t been home all evening.</p><p>His heart pounded with a grief and a loss that he’d never experienced before.</p><p>He chose to give her space. He knew that he’d crossed a line. </p><p>But what else could he have done?</p><p>He supposed he should’ve just killed Tuft. Taking matters into his own hands had always served his purposes best. </p><p>After all, he’d been itching to cast the killing curse for some time now.</p><p>He wanted to kill her more than ever.</p><p>His mind raced, analyzing every detail of their confrontation. Everything seemed to blur in his mind save one thing.</p><p><em> I love you, too, Tom. It scares me how much I love you </em>.</p><p>He closed his eyes, letting the pain swallow him whole.</p><p><em> You can run, little witch, </em> he thought <em> , but you can’t escape me</em>.</p><p>Hermione would be his. She belonged to him, and that would never change.</p><p>He gazed at the vial of blue potion on his dresser... proof of that Hermione was half of his very soul.</p><p>Tom would let her run, but he would not allow her to leave him.</p><p>Not forever.</p><p>He grit his teeth, attempting to stem the ache in his chest.</p><p>He would give her space. He would allow her time, if that’s what she needed. </p><p>He had things to do meanwhile… things to sort out.</p><p>He had a bitch to murder.</p><p>Plans to rearrange.</p><p>An artifact to find.</p><p>Horcruxes to make.</p><p>Tom realized he had to decide which direction to take. His course of action had begun to shift, primarily because of Hermione.</p><p>He decided he would prove to her that he could be a wizard worthy of her. </p><p>What was it that the soul-bond book had mentioned? There were eight stages in a twin flame connection...</p><p>Tom had glossed over that passage in his search for the spell, assuming it was rubbish. Perhaps he had been a bit hasty in that consideration, and should read it again.</p><p>His body ached with hunger. He’d become used to being with her night after night.</p><p>She’d cursed him. It was a powerful curse, and he would have been angry if it hadn’t turned him on.</p><p>He wanted to see her do it again.</p><p>He adjusted himself in his boxers.</p><p>He’d told her he loved her… </p><p>… and she’d given him back his horcrux.</p><p>He looked down at the Gaunt family ring on his left hand. He’d always worn it on the finger where a wedding band should go. </p><p>His jaw muscles flexed as he ripped the ring from his finger and sat it on his nightstand.</p><p>He didn’t want to wear it anymore. She’d tainted it.</p><p>He wouldn’t wear anything on that finger until he wore a wedding band.</p><p>He vowed it with all the cold-bloodedness of a serpent.</p><p>She <em> would </em> be his wife.</p><p>He swore silently that he would marry Hermione Granger.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>The next morning, Dumbledore and Hermione flooed into the ministry and rode up the lift to Level 2, the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. Hermione's footsteps echoed on the black tiled floors as they strode out of the elevator and walked together down a long corridor lined with doors. They passed the offices for the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts and the Improper Use of Magic, and many others as they approached the set of heavy wooden doors of the Auror Headquarters.  Dumbledore and Hermione passed through the aisle, surrounded by cubicles which each housed a different auror, seated at their desks. Several aurors eyed them curiously as they passed. </p><p>When they approached the the door to Dufresne's office, Dumbledore laid a hand on Hermione's shoulder, instructing her to wait. Then, he entered the office and closed the door behind him.</p><p>Hermione stood outside, wringing her hands. The entire room full of aurors was watching her. She felt like she was back in school, being sent to McGonagall's office for detention.</p><p>After a few minutes, a tall, sandy-haired auror with dashing blue robes and warm brown eyes approached her with a brilliant smile. "So, you're Hermione Dumbledore! Seen a lot about you in the papers and whatnot. Is it true that you've quit writing for the <em>Prophet</em>?"</p><p>Hermione looked him up and down before nodding. "Yes, it's true."</p><p>He held out his hand. "Jack McClaggen."</p><p>Hermione took his hand hesitantly, but as soon as he said his name, she realized what it was about the wizard that seemed familiar. </p><p>He <em>had</em> to be related to Cormac McClaggen. Great.</p><p>Before the young man had a chance to say anything further, he was called away by another wizard who needed help in the contraband office.</p><p>Hermione took a deep breath and thanked her lucky stars. Hopefully she wouldn't have to work too closely with him, if he was anything at all like his future relative.</p><p>Quite a bit of time went by as Hermione waited. She was able to observe some of the hustle and bustle of the auror department, of which it seemed there was a definite boy's club that had formed. She was definitely the youngest witch in the room, although one of the interns, a young witch with pitch black hair, seemed about Hermione's age.</p><p>Suddenly, the door opened and Gaspard waved Hermione in.</p><p>Once seated, Gaspard pinned her with an assessing look. </p><p>"Hermione," he began slowly. "Your... <em>father</em>, has informed me of the circumstances surrounding your arrival here in Britain... in this time."</p><p>Her mouth fell open. She was surprised that Dumbledore would trust anyone besides Aberforth with the information, but since Dumbledore trusted Gaspard, she decided that she would as well. It was both unnerving and somewhat of a relief to have someone else know the truth.</p><p>"Given the information, which is rather shocking to me, I'll admit... it's going to take me some time to adjust and <em>process</em> it. However, I have assured him that this information will be kept confidential, and I will not turn you over to the Ministry. I will do my best to ensure that your secret is kept safe." His expression was sober as he ran his hand over his face. "I would not bend the rules for anyone save Dumbledore, Hermione. He has informed me that you are a war hero... and that you have fought many dark wizards."</p><p>"She has defeated a very, very powerful Dark Lord, Dufresne," said Dumbledore quietly. "For what she has been through, and for what she has done, she deserves to be awarded an Order of Merlin, First Class."</p><p>Gaspard's eyes flicked from Dumbledore to Hermione. Though his expression was blank, as usual, she thought she detected a hint of admiration.</p><p>"Well," she muttered, "It's not as glamorous as all that. I did have help, and it was quite a bit of muddling through without much guidance. Could have used a bit more, <em>actually</em>," she whispered, giving Dumbledore a pointed look.</p><p>Dumbledore didn't seem to notice. He was staring at Gaspard.</p><p>"I don't usually do this, but under the circumstances, I will be conducting your testing, Hermione. In particular, I'll be administering your veritaserum. Dumbledore has informed me that I will likely have to change some of your answers, which I <em>do not like to do</em>."</p><p>Hermione swallowed.</p><p>"However, it can't be helped. Knowing what I do now, I need you in my department even more so. I'm willing to bend the rules... this time. But once you are trained, you will follow every rule and guideline which I set forth without question, or you will be dismissed and your badge revoked."</p><p>Hermione rubbed her lips together, her heart beating quickly. "I understand." She glanced at Dumbledore. "Thank you, Albus."</p><p>Gaspard turned his gaze to Dumbledore. "Your... <em>father</em> will be sitting in on your truth test. You'll take it first, and we will get it behind us."</p><p>Dumbledore looked through his spectacles at Gaspard, their blue eyes mirroring one another. "Dufresne, make no mistake. She may not be my blood... but she <em>is</em> my daughter. She is a Dumbledore."</p><p>The auror looked from Dumbledore to Hermione. Hermione met his stare and her lips parted at what she saw in his eyes. She felt confusion set in, because she almost thought she sensed a heat in his gaze. </p><p>Gaspard cleared his throat and stood. "Follow me."</p><p>He brought them down the hallway and into one of the department's interrogation rooms. He left and returned with a vial of a crystal-clear draught: veritaserum. </p><p>"Open your mouth," he instructed curtly as he uncorked the vial and rounded the table to stand before her.</p><p>Hermione's lips parted and she did as he said, opening her mouth. </p><p>He exhaled. "Tongue out, Dumbledore."</p><p>She gazed up at him as she stuck her tongue out. She'd forgotten how bloody tall the man was, but as he stood in front of her, she realized he positively dwarfed her. He held her chin steady with his thumb and index finger as he let three drops fall onto her tongue. Then, he released her and corked the vial. </p><p>"Have a seat," he commanded as he took the seat across from her.</p><p>Within moments, Hermione felt the serum washing over her. Her body felt cold and tingly.</p><p>"Now, I will ask you a series of questions, which the potion will compel you to answer truthfully and in detail. Do not try to fight the effects of the potion. You will not win, and it will greatly tax your mental faculties and if you do that, we won't get much else done today, because you'll be too drained. I don't have time to do this over again, so answer as quickly as possible, Dumbledore."</p><p>Hermione nodded numbly. The potion had almost the same effect on her as the laughing gas her parents used at their dentistry office.</p><p>Gaspard proceeded to ask her a series of simple questions, which were designed to acclimate her and calm her nerves, as well as to give the potion time to work.</p><p>Then, he began asking more invasive questions. He proceeded to record her answers on a scroll of parchment in front of him. Dumbledore stood by in somber silence.</p><p>”Did you ever cheat in school?”</p><p>”Absolutely not.”</p><p>"Have you ever broken the law?"</p><p>"Yes," she answered.</p><p>He paused, and made a note.</p><p>"Do you consider yourself mentally and physically capable of performing the duties required of you by the auror department?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Would you lie to those in authority over you?"</p><p>"If I didn't trust them."</p><p>He looked up from the parchment. "Would you lie to me?"</p><p>"That depends."</p><p>Gaspard narrowed his eyes and chewed the inside of his cheek. "Depends on what?"</p><p>Her voice was strangely monotone as she answered under the influence of the potion. "You already know about my past, so I highly doubt I would lie about anything related to my work. Only, perhaps, if you asked something about my personal life that I did not want to divulge."</p><p>Gaspard nodded thoughtfully. "Well, it's a good thing your personal life is irrelevant to your work here. In most cases, that is." He gazed at her searchingly for a few more moments before reading the next question. "Have you ever cast an unforgivable curse?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>He cocked an eyebrow. "When did you last cast an unforgivable?"</p><p>"Yesterday."</p><p>His brows shot up. He turned and looked at Dumbledore, who also looked surprised.</p><p>Hermione's heart would have been racing, if her body wasn't numb and under the effects of the serum. Anxiety spiked, but it was distant, seeming to be in the far reaches of her consciousness.</p><p>Gaspard ran his hand over his face. "Which unforgivable did you cast?"</p><p>"The cruciatus curse."</p><p>He froze, eyes wide. "Who the hell did you cast the cruciatus curse on, Hermione?"</p><p>"Tom Riddle."</p><p>Gaspard blinked several times. Then, she could have sworn she saw the corners of his lips turn up, but he quickly cleared his throat.</p><p>Dumbledore placed his hand over his mouth.</p><p>”Why did you cast it?” <br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“He was being an arse.”</p><p>He blinked several times as he rubbed his lips together, and then he squeezed his eyes shut, very obviously attempting to hold back his amusement.</p><p>Dumbledore turned to face the wall, chuckling under his breath.</p><p>Gaspard cleared his throat, then took a deep breath.</p><p>"Is that the only time you've cast an unforgivable?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>He released his breath, almost in relief.</p><p>Rubbing his chin, he asked, "Do you plan to abide by all of the rules set forth by this department, even if it goes against your own personal convictions, political views, or relational loyalties?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>His blue eyes flicked back up to her face. “Do you think you could kill someone if you had to?”</p><p>She met his stare. “Yes.”</p><p>Gaspard nodded thoughtfully. He looked back at the parchment, then back at Hermione. “Have you ever been wounded in a duel or a violent altercation, and if so, do you have any scars?”</p><p>”Yes.”</p><p>He froze, his eyes still on the parchment  “What wounds have you sustained?”</p><p>”I was hit by a curse in a duel in fifth year by a dark wizard. I almost died. I have a long scar on my chest. Then… there’s another on my right thigh. Tom Riddle hit me with a slicing hex while we were dueling.”</p><p>Gaspard’s jaw muscles tensed as he paused his writing and stared at the parchment. “Did he now?”</p><p>”Yes. But I sliced open his shoulder with a goblin-forged blade. He still has a scar there now.”</p><p>Gaspard’s jaw cocked to the side and he ejected a violent stream of air. “Is that all?”</p><p>Hermione looked down at her arm, which was covered by the sleeve of her robes. She rolled back her sleeve. “No. There’s this one.”</p><p>Gaspard’s eyes fell to the word carved into her arm. They rested there for several moments before he looked back at Hermione. “Where did you get that?”</p><p>She gave a wry smile. “A dark witch… with a very rigid set of blood purity standards.”</p><p>His expression was unreadable. “You’re muggleborn.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>He nodded pensively. “We will have to record these scars, for your identification profile, along with your physical exam. This one…” He gestured to her arm. “Do you keep it hidden by concealment charms?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>He nodded. “All enchantments are stripped during your physical exam. It appears I will be conducting that as well, because we will have to withhold from recording this one.” His eyes fell back to the scar.</p><p>Dumbledore’s eyes paused on it as well. She had never shown it to him.</p><p>Gaspard’s eyes rose to meet hers, and lingered for many moments. Then, he made another note on the parchment, and continued the interview.</p><p>He continued to ask a series of probing questions about her goals, her motivations, her moral and political beliefs, her dreams, and her skillset, and then, the interview concluded.</p><p>Gaspard stood and cleared his throat. “I see no cause for concern. Except your use of the cruciatus, which I will not be including in my notes. However, the use of an unforgivable curse from here forward without the express permission of the auror department, will result in not only the revoking of your badge, but a trial as well. This is a warning, Miss Dumbledore.”</p><p>Hermione nodded. “I understand.”</p><p>”Come. I’ll conduct your physical while Dumbledore is here to act as a witness. Then you’ll come back tomorrow for the written portion and your psychological examination with our mind healer.”</p><p>”Thank you, Gaspard.”</p><p>He paused as he reached for the door. He gave a curt nod, and then said softly, “It’s Mr. Dufresne now. Welcome to the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.”</p>

</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Edward Rosier was sound asleep, dreaming deeply behind heavily lidded eyes. There was a beautiful redheaded witch in his bed, naked, with long limbs wrapped around his body. There had been a stream of witches coming and going of late, a different one every week since his breakup with Winnie Haywood.</p><p>He’d been secretly courting Winifred for some months and had found himself becoming quite smitten with her. During his time at Hogwarts, he’d always admired the Ravenclaw’s pale flaxen hair, her eyes like sea glass, and the freckles that dotted her milky skin. He’d run into her again back in July at a potion shop, and they’d been seeing one another ever since.</p><p>However, when his father Edwin discovered their relationship, he subjected his son to a series of speeches regarding bloodlines, familial duties, and magical loyalties, and it brought him back to his senses.</p><p>He’d <em> never </em>marry a half-blood. He’d gone and let himself be swindled by her pretty face and sharp mind. She’d cried a river when he broke it off. His face had been cold and unemotional when gave her the news. “You can find yourself another pureblood cock to choke on.”</p><p>She’d stared at him in utter shock, as if he’d suddenly transformed into an entirely different person. Well, he hadn’t. He’d always been Edward Rosier, heir to the Rosier legacy. His pureblood ancestry dated back to medieval France. She should have known better than to attach herself to him, unless her purpose was to use him and his wealth. Whatever the case, his father assured him that she would only sully his immaculate bloodline and bring him sorrow.</p><p>“Yes, father, I ended it. Yes, she cried. Quite manipulative of her, if you ask me.” </p><p>His father had assured him that the witch merely lusted after the power that ran in his magical blood, and the wealth his family could provide. “Witches only want one thing,” said his father stoically. “Choose a pureblooded witch to marry. Sire your heirs…” He laid a hand on his son’s shoulder and whispered conspiratorially, “Then you can have all the half-blood pussy you like.”</p><p>Edward grew to hate Winifred, the poisonous witch. </p><p>He hated her because he wasn’t allowed to love her.</p><p>He convinced himself of her flaws, shortcomings, and her artifice. It was the only way his mind could cope.</p><p>Since then, he’d been abusing firewhisky, dreamless sleep potion, and a chain of witches that came and went like a revolving door.</p><p>At precisely seven am, Tom Riddle entered the Rosier mansion and unlocked the door to Edward’s bedroom. </p><p>“Get up, Rosier.”</p><p>The redheaded witch lifted her head sleepily, only to find Tom standing there at the foot of the bed.</p><p>She screamed, which woke Edward violently from his sleep.</p><p>“Fuck!” he exclaimed as he looked up to see Tom. The witch scrambled up, gripping the sheets to her chest.</p><p>“W-what the hell,” she murmured.</p><p>“My Lord,” muttered Rosier as he reached over the side of the bed to locate his trousers.</p><p>“Get dressed,” said Tom curtly. “We are meeting for dueling practice.”</p><p>“Give me a minute,” he mumbled.</p><p>Tom glanced at the witch with a smirk. “Brittania, is it? Hufflepuff, I believe?”</p><p>The witch gazed at him with wide eyes and swallowed, nodding.</p><p>“Charmed.” He picked up an empty bottle that was sitting on the chest at the foot of the bed, then sniffed it. He raised his eyebrows at Rosier, who was jerking on his pants and boots.</p><p>“You never said I couldn’t drink,” he muttered.</p><p>Tom sat the bottle down and turned to leave. “Round up the rest and meet me at Malfoy Manor.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Hermione walked into the Ministry the next morning, feeling much better about life in general. She thought she would feel anxious about the fact that someone else knew that she was a time traveler, but to her surprise, she felt relieved. It was a heavy burden to bear, and she was thankful that she wouldn’t have to take drastic measures to try to hide the truth from her employer. Gaspard was, after all, a highly trained and skilled investigator, and it was a definite possibility that he would have uncovered the truth at some point.</p><p>When Hermione approached the door to the DMLE, she found it locked, as usual. She knocked, and was admitted by one of the department’s interns, a young black-haired witch with green eyes.</p><p>She was greeted by a young wizard with eyes as black as Tom’s, and waving, auburn hair. He was pale-skinned but attractive in a youthful, boyish way. He extended his hand. “Eustace Bones, Head of the Auror Department.”</p><p>“Youngest head since 1793!” shouted a witch from across the room.</p><p>Eustace smiled shyly and saluted the witch, his cheeks reddening slightly. Hermione could already tell that he was well-liked by his peers. She couldn’t help but like him already. He had a warm demeanor, quite the opposite from Gaspard’s icy disposition.</p><p>She took his hand and shook it. “Hermione Dumbledore.”</p><p>“I know who you are,” he smiled. “You’ve made quite a bit of waves for our department, but I won’t hold it against you.”</p><p>“Oh, right,” she said wryly. “The Azkaban article.”</p><p>He winced. “Right. Well, if Mr. Dufresne thinks you’d make a great auror, then I very much look forward to seeing you in action. After your training, of course. You’re already good at digging up information, I see.” He winked and then gestured to the room at large. “Let me introduce you to some of our force.”</p><p>He introduced her to their interns, one of which was Peoria Parkinson. Hermione took a wild guess that she was probably related to Pansy, perhaps a great-aunt or distant cousin.</p><p>Then she became acquainted with the aurors as Eustace pointed them out one by one.</p><p>“This is Effie Diggory, overseer of the Witch Watchers, Dara Bletchley, Zyrus Broadmoor, Myra Grimblehawk, Andrew Rabnott, and Jack Mcclaggen, whom I believe you’ve already met.” He gestured to the other side of the room, to a group of aurors seated in cubicles. “This charming witch is Constance Pickering, and of course, a department veteran, Frederick Sykes… then, a new trainee like yourself, Helena Wolpert. And lastly, we have Cash Zabini, and Zeus Vane, our resident warlock - an expert in dueling and martial magic.”</p><p>Another wizard came walking through at that moment, and Eustace gestured toward him. “That’s Elphinstone Urquart, one of our Hit Wizards and a new officer in the Magical Law Enforcement Squad. Of course, we do have a larger force than this, but some are off duty.”</p><p>Hermione recognized Urquart as Minerva McGonagall’s future husband. She’d nearly forgotten that in her younger years, Minerva had worked for the DMLE. Perhaps, she would even meet her after she graduated from Hogwarts. How strange it felt, to now be older than her former Gryffindor Head of House. </p><p>Hermione cleared her throat, somewhat overwhelmed by the onslaught of new names and faces. </p><p>Eustace brought her on a tour of the entire floor, allowing her to familiarize herself with the various departments of the DMLE. </p><p>By the end of the day, she had a feel for the facilities and had passed the screening test and the written portion with flying colors.</p><p>As she wrapped up her preliminaries, Eustace handed her an identification card.</p><p>

</p><p>“You’ll get your badge once we determine what level you’ll start at in your training. You’ll be given some study materials and a week from today, you’ll be tested in each subject of the curriculum.”</p><p>Hermione’s eyebrows rose. “What subjects are those?”</p><p>“Well, let me see if I can get you a copy of the course list.” He exited a door to the left and then returned a few minutes later with a paper, which he cast a duplication charm on.</p><p>He handed her the duplicate, and she examined the list.</p><p>
<b>Auror Training Courses &amp; Magical Combat Curriculum</b>
</p><ul>
<li>Concealment and Disguise</li>
<li>Stealth and Tracking</li>
<li>Battle Instinct</li>
<li>Best-Laid Plans</li>
<li>Duelling in the Dark</li>

<li>History of the Dark Arts</li>

<li>Poisons and Antidotes</li>
</ul><p>Hermione’s eyebrows rose. “Who teaches all of these?"</p><p>He looked over her shoulder at the list, and then replied, “Each senior auror is required to teach at least one course. I’ll be teaching Stealth and Tracking. Let’s see… Dufresne teaches Battle Instinct and Duelling in the Dark.” He looked at her appraisingly. “Perhaps you’ll be able to bypass some of these… or at least jump in in the middle, rather than wait for the courses to start again next quarter. Some of them can be taken as you go, which is preferable. That way you can get started on the field immediately, which is what Dufresne expressed hope for.”</p><p>“Oh, did he?”</p><p>The auror nodded. He pulled out his pocket watch and checked the time. “Now, you might as well take off early for today. Be sure to check in with Dufresne before you go, in case there’s anything still left on the agenda. Oh, and by the way…” He reached into his robes and retrieved her wand, which he’d confiscated earlier that day. “Your wand has been registered and spelled into the wards now, which will allow you to enter the Department on your own.”</p><p>She took her wand. “Thank you, Mr. Bones.”</p><p>With a nod and a bow, he left.</p><p>Hermione took a deep breath and approached the door to her boss’ office. She bit her lip, then lifted her hand and knocked. She hasn’t been nervous when approaching him for a quote for her article. She hadn’t even been nervous when he escorted her to the inaugural ball at Tuft Manor. But for some reason, being his subordinate and trainee caused her a bit of apprehension. </p><p><em> You’ve fought for your life against death eaters and you’ve crucio’d Voldemort, </em> she told herself. <em> There’s nothing to be anxious about. </em></p><p>She heaved a sigh. The perfectionist within her wanted to succeed in her new position, and it caused her some mild anxiety.</p><p>The door opened and she was admitted. </p><p>“Mr. Bones told me to check in with you before I left.”</p><p>Gaspard glanced up from the file on his desk. “Right. Dumbledore. Have a seat.”</p><p>Hermione took the chair in front of his desk. </p><p>“Do you feel acclimated yet?”</p><p>“Getting there.”</p><p>He nodded. “You’ll see Mrs. Diggory before you go. She will get you your textbooks so that you can brush up before your assessments.”</p><p>Hermione nodded, then broached the topic. “I know it’s in bad form to ask for a day off since I’ve only just started… but I did have this scheduled before I was hired.”</p><p>Gaspard stared at her blankly. “Go on.”</p><p>She swallowed. “Well, it’s just that… I have an interview scheduled tomorrow. With <em> Witch Weekly </em>. They’ve… chosen me as Witch of the Year.”</p><p>Gaspard blinked several times, then sat back in his chair and rubbed his hand along his jawline. He took a deep breath, then muttered, “A socialite for an auror. It’s definitely a first.”</p><p>The corner of Hermione’s lips twitched as she fought back a smirk.</p><p>She thought she detected a hint of humor in his expression as well, but as usual, he was difficult to read. “Very well. You may have the day, since you’ve only just started. Do try to schedule your social obligations on your days off from now on.”</p><p>“Of course,” she murmured. </p><p>“Study your materials well. I’m hoping you can bypass a good bit of the training. It would be good to get you onto the field to start with.”</p><p>“Yes, Mr. Dufresne.”</p><p>His eyes met hers, and he pressed his tongue against his cheek before muttering, “You may go.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Tom hit Rosier with the impediment hex, followed by a stinging hex. </p><p>“Fuck!” yelled Rosier, gripping his bicep. “How many times are you going to hex me today?”</p><p>“Perhaps I should curse you instead. Then you might try harder.”</p><p>Rosier cast a few spells Tom’s way, their bright colors flying by as Riddle sidestepped nimbly. He hit Rosier with a tripping jinx, and the latter fell flat on his face.</p><p>Rosier’s heavy exhale could be heard through the hall, eliciting snickers from his colleagues.</p><p>“Get up,” Riddle spat.</p><p>He stood, and then each paused for a moment, wands raised. Then, a volley of spells began to fly across the room, with Edward primarily shielding and Tom casting, his right wand hand whipping back and forth in sharp flicks and snappy movements as spells shot rapidly from his pale yew wand.</p><p>Anytime Tom drew his wand, it instilled fear in his followers. The long, sinister-looking instrument seemed to be capable of casting spells at lightning speed, and was particularly well-suited to curses and dark magic, as yew wands were often reputed for. </p><p>Despite the terror induced by the wand itself, it was the wielder which unsettled them most. They often discussed Riddle’s dueling amongst themselves, likening him to a serpent poised to strike. There was Tom, the man, and then there was Voldemort, Tom’s spine-chilling alter ego, a force hidden just behind the wall of his countenance, a sentient being who seemed to always be listening and observing them in secrecy behind Tom's carefully crafted charm. They often caught a glimpse of the shadow of Voldemort when his eyes occasionally shifted to crimson, or perhaps when something was said to spark his cold rage. Then, Lord Voldemort would rise to the surface, like a demon being called forth by a priest.</p><p>Tom hit Rosier with a burning hands hex.</p><p>“Fuck, fuck, <b>fuck</b>!” shouted his opponent, dropping his wand as his trembling hands turned bright red, emitting smoke and steam. “If you keep hexing me, and I’m not going to be able to duel for weeks. What’s your <em>problem </em>today?”</p><p>Tom casually adjusted the leather dueling glove on his wand hand. “The problem is not mine. It’s yours. You’re being hexed because you’re weak and slow. You spend all your time shagging and drinking, so your reflexes are dull.”</p><p>Rosier’s jaw clenched as he glared down at his burning hands.</p><p>“Just be glad I used hexes and not curses this time.” Tom waved his wand with a swish and Rosier’s hands returned to their normal state. “Avery… Nott… you two spar next.”</p><p>As he walked past Rosier, he said, “Come with me.”</p><p>Tom led him to the other side of the hall, away from the others. He pulled out two chairs and they sat in them as they watched the two death eaters duel. </p><p>Tom observed them closely, his keen eyes taking in every move, each mistake and misstep. “You’re casting a bit to the left, Avery. That’s why you’re missing him every time. You need to adjust your aim. Cast a bit to the right to overcompensate.”</p><p>Rosier glanced at Tom, then back at the duel. </p><p>The sparring continued, until Tom interrupted, “Acacius, you’ve got to stop hesitating. There’s a split second delay on every spell you cast, and it’s making you slow. Don’t think, just cast. The more you practice, the more you’ll sharpen your reflexes. Let your instincts guide you, not your empty head. It’s not doing you any favors.”</p><p>Nott nodded in acknowledgement, and the pair continued to spar. </p><p>After another bout, Tom interjected, “Don’t step <em> before </em> you cast. Step <em> when </em> you cast!”</p><p>Tom sat stoically, his black eyes darting back and forth in incisive observation. Finally, after a few more minutes, he stood and approached Avery. “Let me see your wand.”</p><p>Avery handed the wand to Tom. </p><p>His eyebrows furrowed. “This is Silver Lime wood, is it not?”</p><p>Avery nodded. </p><p>“These wands aid those skilled in Legilimency. You are a trained legilimens, William. You can utilize that in dueling. Use your skills to predict what he will cast next. He’s slow anyway, so you have a window of time before each spell to practice it. There’s a plane in the mental realm.” Tom put his fingertip to his temple. “Here. A skilled legilimens can tap into that realm and stay there during a duel. It’s like a frequency. Tune into it, and read his thoughts before he casts. Then, you can block or counter, and choose your next spell accordingly. Work on it.”</p><p>Tom handed Avery his wand and turned away.</p><p>As the two began to spar again, Tom turned his attention to Rosier, who sat silently by his side. </p><p>“What’s with the redhead?”</p><p>Rosier looked at Tom in surprise. “Er- I don’t know what you mean.”</p><p>“I thought you were seeing another bird… was it Winnie? Something like that.”</p><p>Rosier shifted uncomfortably. He’d never had a conversation with Riddle that didn’t center around magic or politics.</p><p>“Um… I <em>was</em>, but I got rid of her.”</p><p>Tom cocked a brow.</p><p>Rosier met his gaze. “Well, she’s a bloody <em> half-blood</em>.”</p><p>Tom blinked several times.</p><p>Rosier cleared his throat. “I mean, there’s nothing <em> wrong </em> with being a half-blood, of course. I didn’t mean it like that. I just…” He looked down at his wand, which he toyed with in his hands. “You know… Gotta keep the blood pure… and all that.”</p><p>Tom nodded placidly. “Of course.”</p><p>He stood and called out, “Enough. William and Acacius, have a seat. Dolohov and Lestrange, you’re next.”</p><p>He sat back down and watched as his two death eaters took to the center of the dueling hall of Malfoy Manor. </p><p>Tom withdrew his cigarettes and lit one. </p><p>Rosier shifted in his seat, then threw a glance Tom’s way. “Why do you ask about Winnie?”</p><p>Tom held the cigarette between his thumb and forefinger, inhaling sharply. “Curiosity.”</p><p>Rosier’s brows furrowed. After a few minutes, he leaned over to Tom and muttered, “I heard Hermione Dumbledore’s left the <em> Prophet </em>.”</p><p>Tom said nothing, his eyes following Dolohov’s footwork.</p><p>“Carrow’s the new editor-in-chief, right? Was that your doing?”</p><p>Tom blinked, then his eyes slowly cut to Rosier. “What do you think?”</p><p>Rosier looked away, nodding.</p><p>“So,” Tom muttered. “Who are you going to marry then, to pump out your heirs?”</p><p>Rosier’s head snapped to the side. “Um… I don’t know. Maybe Cora. The bloody Bulstrodes are letting the half-bloods in now, so that's out of the question." He flicked his eyes at Tom, realizing once again, his mistake. </p><p>Tom merely smirked. "The pool is, indeed, becoming rather sparse. One would almost think blood purity is on its way out."</p><p>Rosier furrowed his brows in contemplation.</p><p>"Some of the older pureblood families still believe in the gods," Tom continued. "I do wonder if the birth of magical blood into muggle families is a message for us from the gods."</p><p>Rosier's face twisted in confusion at this cryptic talk, his nose wrinkling as he looked at Tom. "What do you mean by that, Voldemort?"</p><p>"How are muggleborns getting their magic if they've no magical blood? Have you ever wondered?"</p><p>He looked at Tom out of the corner of his eye. Despite their being on the other side of the hall, the others' ears had pricked up, listening in on their discussion. Even Dolohov threw a glance their way, earning him a hit from a jelly legs jinx. He cast the counter and continued to spar.</p><p>"I mean... Some say they <em>stole</em> their magic," replied Rosier. "Makes no sense for muggles to give birth to magical people."</p><p>Tom fixed him with a penetrating stare. "And do you believe that?"</p><p>Rosier glanced at him and then looked away, swallowing. "I don't know. Even if it is possible, it can't be the <em>same</em> magic. It can't be as strong as the magic of <em>real</em> wizards."</p><p>Tom chuckled. "And is a half-blood a <em>real</em> wizard?"</p><p>Rosier swallowed. "Well, it can't... it can't always be helped." He cut his eyes at Tom. "I mean... you've got <em>Gaunt</em> blood, my Lord. That is some of the strongest magical blood there is."</p><p>"I don't need your flattery, Rosier." Tom narrowed his eyes as he became lost in thought. "Blood matters very little if you can't even block a bloody stinging hex."</p><p>His eyes followed each movement of the two wizards sparring as he sucked smoke into his lungs from his cigarette.</p><p>"Dolohov," he called out as he stood and approached them. "Why do you stand like that, as if you've got no bloody balls between your legs? Are you a wizard or are you a witch?"</p><p>He proceeded to demonstrate proper stance, indicating where Dolohov's form was falling short. "Constrict your abdominal muscles. All of your force should come from your core, not your legs. Let the energy flow from your center, as it is your magic which flows from there. Your physical and magical energy should flow in unison. Besides, if you rely on your leg muscles to do the work, you'll wind up off balance and it will slow you in the long run. Dueling is very precise and speed is everything. Even a fraction of a second can mean your death."</p><p>Tom turned and looked at his death eaters. "We are making a move against the statute of secrecy soon, and I'm going to inform you right now... the aurors mean business. You've got to be quicker, smarter, and stealthier. Not only that, but you've got to be more ruthless and bloodthirsty. Where they may hesitate, you must be resolute. You must be willing to cast the dark curses without restraint... and you <em>cannot</em> be caught. If any of you get your hides thrown into Azkaban by Gaspard <em>fucking</em> Dufresne... I swear to Salazar, I'm leaving you there."</p><p>Dolohov scoffed.</p><p>Tom cocked his head, his irises shifting to blazing crimson. "Have you got something to say, <em>Miss</em>?"</p><p>There were snickers from the others.</p><p>Dolohov's face fell. "No. But... Mulciber, he heard something at the ministry yesterday."</p><p>Tom's hand snapped up, bringing his cigarette to his lips. "Alright. What is this information that's supposed to interest me?"</p><p>Dolohov glanced at Mulciber, who cleared his throat. "It's being whispered in Foreign Affairs that Gaspard Dufresne hired Dumbledore's daughter... as an auror. I was going to bring it up... at Saturday's meeting."</p><p>Tom's eyes narrowed. </p><p>Dolohov snorted. "She's an attention-seeking little cunt, if you ask me."</p><p>Tom's nostrils flared, and that was the only sign given before he snapped.</p><p>Suddenly, Dolohov was thrown back against the wall, some ten or twelve feet away. Tom's death eaters stood in unison, murmuring in alarm as they noticed the shift in Tom's face. They couldn't discern exactly <em>what</em> had shifted, only they noticed that he no longer looked like himself, but something or someone... else.</p><p>Tom moved in quick, powerful strides and he was suddenly upon Dolohov like a rabid beast. He used no magic, but his fists were enough. His sharp knuckles met Dolohov's chin and then his other fist sunk into the wizard's gut once, then hauled back again and connected with his ribcage. <br/>
<br/>
Then, Dolohov let out a guttural scream as Tom put out his cigarette on the wizard’s neck. The sizzle and scent of burning flesh filled the air.</p><p>Dolohov tried to fend him off, bending at the waist and crossing his forearms over his face, but he could hardly defend against the ferocity of Tom's assault. </p><p>Dolohov managed to strike Tom in the side, but Tom gripped the back of his neck and forced him down, aiming a blow to his ribs with his right knee. He instantly felt his rib crack.</p><p>Fear pierced Dolohov, because though he attempted to break free of Tom's hold, he realized that Tom's strength was almost inhuman. Dolohov was the same height as Riddle, but was a great deal bulkier size-wise. That, however, didn't seem to matter, as Tom was clearly pulling from some other source beyond his own physical capacity.</p><p>"What-" he rasped, trying to mumble through the pain in his ribs. "What did I say?"</p><p>But Tom was seeing red. His hold on the death eater's neck shifted and Tom gripped his throat, slamming him back against the wall. In the same instant, he hauled back and his fist connected powerfully with Dolohov's nose. </p><p>The crack was audible, causing Avery and Mulciber to flinch. The others cringed and recoiled, sucking in air through their teeth.</p><p>Tom didn't stop. He threw several more jabs in quick succession, then threw an uppercut which caused Dolohov's teeth to clack. He pummeled the wizard with rapid fire strikes until his face streamed with blood.</p><p>Then, in a movement so quick it was almost discarnate, he conjured a blade and spun it before driving it ruthlessly into Dolohov's thigh.</p><p>With a jarring scream, the death eater sunk to his knees on the floor, eyes rolling back as he slumped over. </p><p>Malfoy grimaced and started forward as the blood smeared like a fan on the marble floor.</p><p>Tom reared back and kicked him again in his wounded ribcage, then spit on him for good measure.</p><p>Everyone stood frozen, watching Riddle's savagery with wide eyes. </p><p>Tom cocked his head in a preternatural movement, scowling at Dolohov as his jaw muscles clenched, eyes glowing red as the blood on the floor. His chest heaved as he muttered, "Practice is over."</p><p>Then he jerked his robes out of his chair and turned to walk out of the double doors.</p><p> </p>

</p><p> </p><p>Tom stared at the parchment. </p><p>The last message he’d written to her was still scrawled upon it.</p><p>
<em> Hermione, answer me, so I know you’re alright. </em>
</p><p>No response. It had been a week.</p><p>Tom sighed. His eyes flicked to the vial filled with blue potion.</p><p>It was a constant reminder that Hermione was his soulmate. </p><p>She belonged to him.</p><p>A digression. That’s what this was. </p><p>He would go and see the seer this week. He hadn't been to her in two years. Perhaps she had some useful information. </p><p>Tom felt uneasy. He was somewhat assured that the soul connection they shared would alert him if something was seriously wrong on her end, as it had with her potion overdose.</p><p>He hoped she didn’t start taking them again.</p><p>He sighed. He just needed to know that she was alright.</p><p>Visions of the night she overdosed played like a film reel in his mind.</p><p>He wouldn’t visit her flat. Somehow he knew that would only make her angrier.</p><p>He’d forced her out of a job that she loved. He could understand her fury. But it frustrated him that she couldn’t see <em> why </em> he’d done it.</p><p>Everything he’d done of late had been for her.</p><p>Now, she’d gone and signed on for a job that was far more dangerous than her previous job, one that could make her even more enemies, and one that could potentially be even more damaging to his organization.</p><p>“Fucking witch,” he muttered poisonously. She'd probably done it just to spite him.</p><p>His thoughts were interrupted by a rapping on the window of his flat. He crossed the room and opened the jamb, immediately recognizing Wilhelmina Tuft’s owl. His jaw tensed as he opened the letter bearing her seal.</p><p>
<em> Can we meet this week? </em>
</p><p>He exhaled sharply. Tom wanted nothing better than to strangle this woman with his bare hands. But now wasn’t the right time.</p><p>Tom had plans, and he needed her alive until the proper moment.</p><p>Then he would dispose of her tactfully, and Hermione would take her place.</p><p>Tom penned a reply and sent it off with her owl.</p><p>Then he rolled up the parchment and set it aside.</p><p>He hadn’t been able to sleep for several nights, so he’d turned to Dreamless Sleep potion. He’d have to stop taking it eventually, as he knew it could be highly addictive.</p><p>But tonight, he needed a full night's sleep without being tortured by thoughts of Hermione.</p><p>He’d become too used to having her in bed next to him; her scent was already beginning to fade. Her pillows were still in his bed, and her toothbrush, and a few of her nightgowns.</p><p>He’d check on her soon. He reminded himself that he could always project into her flat without alerting her.</p><p>Tom knocked back a potion, and within minutes, he passed out.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>The next morning, Tom made his way down Diagon Alley, as he did every morning. He stopped at the newsstand, checking the shelves as he waited for his coffee.</p><p>He stopped short as his eyes focused on the morning's publications. Hermione was the topic of almost every headline.</p><p>The front page of <em>The Daily Prophet</em> read, <strong><em>Dufresne &amp; Dumbledore: Dynamic Duo?</em></strong></p><p>There were copies of <em>Witch Weekly</em> lining the shelves, and Hermione stared at him from the front cover, featured as <strong>Witch of the Year</strong> beside the headline, “<em>From Author to Auror: Hermione Dumbledore.</em>” The sight of her made Tom’s chest tighten uncomfortably. </p><p>He scooped up a copy of the magazine and took his coffee from the stand owner.</p><p>Rather than walk the length of Knockturn Alley, as he typically did most mornings, he apparated to the front door and withdrew his wand, unlocking the shop. He entered and flipped the sign to “Open,” then made his way to the front desk, where he opened the magazine to page twelve.</p><p>There were several pages of photographs. Hermione was pictured in several trendy sets of robes, showcasing Madam Malkin’s latest designs. In two of the photos, she sat with her elf, Piksy, and the two were smiling and laughing. The sight of her smiling and happy made Tom nauseous. </p><p>He flipped the pages and stared down at a photograph of Hermione in a little black dress, seated casually on a Chesterfield sofa. Tom’s lips parted, his eyes roving every inch of her form. </p><p>He knew her body. He'd memorized the feel of her velvety smooth skin beneath his fingertips. </p><p>If he were an artist, he could draw her from memory, down to the tiniest details.</p><p>His eyes scanned her face, her red lips. It brought back a memory of those lips wrapped around his cock. </p><p>He recalled the taste of her, the way each kiss made him hungry for more, never fully sating him.</p><p>“You’ll be mine again, little witch,” he breathed. </p><p>He flipped the magazine to the next page and began to read the article.</p><p> </p><p>

<br/>
<em>She walks into our Witch Weekly offices with a smile on her face and a cup of tea in hand. I ask what she’s drinking.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Earl grey and vanilla,” she beams, her brilliant teeth gleaming behind ruby red lips. “Always.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>She appears in our offices like a ray of sunshine, despite her sleek, black pencil dress, over which she wears a trendy set of robes, one of the many custom-tailored by Madam Malkin, whom she now exclusively wears. Her hair is thick and styled into her signature curls, which have sparked quite a trend in London.</em>
</p><p>
<em>I’m rather surprised by her petite stature, as the reputation of this brilliant witch seems to have cast her as seven feet tall, but in reality, she stands at a mere five feet &amp; five inches. </em>
</p><p>
<em>“I cheat a bit,” she says with a secretive smile, pointing to her Chanel pumps. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Hermione Dumbledore is the epitome of the “it witch ,” as she seamlessly blends a unique panache of muggle fashions and witchly style, always appearing effortlessly en vogue, no matter how busy she might be.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Let me tell you, she is one busy witch! </em>
</p><p>
<em>She is much more than a pretty face in a stylish dress. Bursting on the scene in February of last year, Hermione Dagworth-Granger was introduced to wizarding London by a new name, one with fame already attached.</em>
</p><p>
<em> Dumbledore .</em>
</p><p>
<em>I ask her the question that we’ve all been burning to have answered since February.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“How did it feel to discover your father was the famous Dumbledore after all these years?”</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Hmm.” She takes her time answering me, wrinkling her brows as she contemplates. “The only way I can describe the feeling is that it felt as if I were being reacquainted with someone I’d known in a past life.” She smiles mysteriously. “I didn’t care so much about his fame. I was just happy to have someone in my corner.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>We are all understandably swooning over Hermione, and the wizards of London are no exception.</em>
</p><p>
<em>This sensational witch has been seen on the arm of nearly every eligible bachelor in magical Britain at the attendance of various events throughout the city, with a brief romantic link to Alphard Black, prestigious heir to the Most Noble House of Black.</em>
</p><p>
<em>We have chosen Hermione as Witch Weekly’s Witch of the Year, projecting her to be the most groundbreaking and talked about female figure in Britain for the year 1949. The timing of this feature is impeccable, to say the least, because it seems as if Hermione has stepped up to the pitch so to speak, elevating her career goals in such a shocking way that all of Britain will certainly turn their heads, if they haven’t already.</em>
</p><p>
<em>In February of last year, Miss Dumbledore was hired as a columnist at London’s premier magical news publication, The Daily Prophet . She quickly rose to distinction among her peers, her shockingly progressive themes and emotionally stirring discourse skyrocketing her to popularity with the public. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Hermione Dumbledore couldn’t stay out of the spotlight if she tried. From Minister Moon to Harpies' Seeker Agabus Friar, Hermione’s standing within key social and political spheres is second-to-none.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Not only is Hermione collecting allies and making waves, but she’s become an outspoken advocate for those who have little to no voice in our society, namely muggles, muggleborns, house elves, and magical creatures. Her philanthropic efforts have earned her an appointment as the Ministry of Magic’s Muggle Relations Liaison and a seat on the council of the International Confederation of Wizards.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“You’ve been so bold in your pursuits, Miss Dumbledore,” I state honestly, intending no flattery. “You’ve challenged social stigmas, political traditions, and wizarding institutions that have been in place for hundreds of years. In the span of one year, you’ve initiated the building of an innovative new wizarding bank, asked revolutionary and thought-provoking questions, and triggered a radical insurrection toward Britain’s current wizarding prison. All this, while looking incredibly stylish and managing your work and social engagements. How do you maintain such a spotless image at such a young age, and with so much responsibility weighing on your shoulders?”</em>
</p><p>
<em>“I just do what I’ve always done,” she laughs, lighting up the room. “I work! I put my heart and soul into everything that I do, and most importantly, I follow my passions. I was always a bit of a brainiac in my younger years, but what I’ve learned now, in adulthood, is that my head and my heart were meant to work together. My heart guides me, and my head backs me up! I couldn’t accomplish anything without my books and my brains.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>A year ago, one could have argued that the fame and renown of Albus Dumbledore could not be matched. However, today, with his ambitious and passionate daughter seated before me, I can say with confidence that Hermione Dumbledore is undoubtedly following in her father’s footsteps and admirably magnifying the Dumbledore legacy.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Which leads me, a feature writer at Witch Weekly, to reveal a shocking and outrageous twist of fate for Miss Hermione: the ousting of this fabulous witch from her job at The Daily Prophet.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Can you tell our readers why you quit your job writing for The Daily Prophet?”</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Well, if I’m being perfectly honest, I think someone at the Ministry doesn’t like my political views. My editor-in-chief retired, though he’d never expressed a desire to do so before. It was all quite sudden. He was replaced, and I was essentially told that my writings would be censored for the foreseeable future. As you can probably imagine, that didn’t sit too well with me.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>I laugh at the tenacious look on her face. Hermione Dumbledore is a witch that will not be trifled with! Knowing her trailblazing personality, we can almost predict that she will one day branch out into the publishing world and start her own paper. Magical London could only hope! On the heels of this occupational metamorphosis, Hermione has recently signed a book deal with the publishing house Obscurus Books, distributor of Newt Scamander’s best-selling book, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. </em>
</p><p>
<em>“What can you tell us about the book deal?”</em>
</p><p>
<em>“I’m keeping it under wraps at the moment, but I can say that it is slated to be published around early spring,” she says with a dazzling grin, clearly proud of her latest accomplishment, and rightly so. </em>
</p><p>
<em>I’m no seer, but I predict a best-seller.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Instead of letting this minor setback with the Prophet ruin her year, Miss Dumbledore has pivoted in a way that can only be described as audacious and inspirational. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Following her groundbreaking article which uncovered the now highly publicized Azkaban prison breach this past August, the Department of Magical Law Enforcement has been under fire. The department wrongly imprisoned an innocent man and concealed the breach from the public, angering the wizarding populace and bringing the entire DMLE under immense heat. </em>
</p><p>
<em>“I never intended to blame the DMLE, nor Mr. Dufresne,” Hermione says, hoping to clear up the misunderstanding. “My father has long been an outspoken advocate for a new wizarding prison, and he’s close friends with Mr. Dufresne. I think the department is doing all that it can, and I greatly admire Mr. Dufresne and the way he has completely revolutionized the DMLE. He’s truly one of the best we have employed by the Ministry of Magic.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Is it safe to say that he’s a hero of yours?”</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Oh, of course,” she smiles enchantingly. “He’s a great inspiration to me in my career.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>Gaspard Dufresne and Hermione Dumbledore were seen together attending the inaugural banquet of Minister Tuft last year. Was this perhaps a bit of foreshadowing, or is there something else astir? Perhaps we’ll leave that to the gossip columns. </em>
</p><p>
<em>They do love Hermione, after all.</em>
</p><p>
<em>But what better way to reinvent herself than to pursue her investigatory skillset and innate Dumbledore duelling abilities than by joining the Auror Department?</em>
</p><p>
<em>When asked what possessed her to pursue a career as an auror, her response was reminiscent of her father’s whimsical charm.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Well, Mr. Dufresne and I were at a bit of an impasse. I think he admired my ability to uncover a story, but understandably, didn’t care for being the subject of my articles too much,” Hermione laughs. “He joked that my skills would be put to better use as an auror. He might be right. We’ll have to see.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>While Great Britain will certainly miss her compelling writings, we will be watching with bated breath to see the emergence of Auror Hermione Dumbledore. </em>
</p><p>
<em>“Now for the million galleon question, Hermione. I’m sure you know what’s coming! At your young age, you’ve already built quite a network of influential friends, you’ve cultivated an unmatched reputation and won the hearts of Great Britain, all while demonstrating that you are both a magical and a political force. You have a book coming out, and your new career with the auror department will certainly equip you with a strategic understanding of the inner workings of the Ministry, as well as magical combat. So the question that everyone will surely ask: Have you considered a run for Minister in your lifetime?”</em>
</p><p>
<em>Hermione chuckles and primly sips her tea. “I honestly haven’t thought about it. I’ve been far too busy trying to make the wizarding world a better place from where I’m at currently. It’s hard work! There’s just so much that needs to change. I couldn’t possibly add another thing to my plate, or even contemplate a change right now. I’m fully committed to the Auror Department for the foreseeable future.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>At Hermione’s side is her trusted house elf, Piksy, whom she insisted on bringing along for the photoshoot. The dainty elf sits quietly by her side, but gazes at her adoringly, and it’s clear that she views Miss Dumbledore as more of a friend than an employer. That in itself speaks volumes, since the little elf probably knows her mistress better than anyone, save Albus Dumbledore himself.</em>
</p><p>
<em>When asked her thoughts on her mistress being chosen as Witch of the Year, Piksy ecstatically beams, “Miss Hermione is the greatest witch who will ever live!”</em>
</p><p>
<em>It certainly seems to be the consensus from those who’ve had the pleasure of meeting Miss Dumbledore that she is truly a bright witch with unlimited potential. </em>
</p><p>
<em>What I can tell you from my brief interaction with this sensational witch, is that one thing is absolutely certain: Hermione Dumbledore is <strong>unforgettable</strong>.</em>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Gaspard tossed the magazine onto his desk. He appreciated her attempt to smooth over the damage done to the PR of his department, but it was a little too late for that now. </p><p>It was a moving article and it certainly brought positive attention to the DMLE. He wasn’t really concerned with that though. </p><p>
<em> A hero. </em>
</p><p>She’d said she <em> admired </em> him.</p><p>Gaspard knew he shouldn’t take it to mean anything. He tamped down on his emotions with an iron fist.</p><p>
<em> Stop thinking about her.</em>
</p><p>The witch was still seeing Riddle, as far as he knew, although her answers during the truth assessment had shocked him.</p><p>She had a scar on her thigh from Riddle’s curse. She’d stabbed him and crucio’d him. </p><p>What a strange relationship they must have.</p><p>He couldn’t help admiring the witch for her audacity. She was certainly a fiery one, and it served to only fascinate him more.</p><p>Gaspard sighed. The witch was young, and young witches loved toxic wizards. Well, that wasn’t Gaspard, so he needed to stop <em> fucking </em> thinking about her. </p><p>He pinched the bridge of his nose, willing himself to think about something else. It was rather difficult to do now that she was right under his nose at all hours of the day, not to mention that her face was plastered all over the papers and magazines that came across his desk every morning. He’d locked himself away in his office more of late, just to avoid seeing her tagging along behind Eustace, or biting her quill with her tiny teeth while taking her assessments.</p><p>He was glad to have her in the auror department. She would make a powerful addition to the force. But it was also torturous, seeing her near constantly.</p><p>Unprofessional. That’s what it was. Gaspard was nothing if not committed to professionalism.</p><p>He ran a hand over his face, gazing down at the article. Something told him that Wilhelmina Tuft would not appreciate the fame and adoration Hermione was garnering. Tuft had only just been elected Minister.</p><p>Gaspard looked at his watch. It was getting late. He’d been working late, to no avail. The Azkaban breach and the robbery were still unsolved, and Hausler was nowhere to be found.</p><p>If only he had a wand warrant to search Riddle’s wand. </p><p>Gaspard took a deep breath and opened the file on his desk. A witch in Bristol had been caught brewing illegal, highly combustible potions. She’d set one off, killing three muggles. Gaspard examined the report from the Department of Intoxicating Substances. He wrote up a directive, which would send a squad to examine the scene and conduct the necessary memory charms. </p><p>When he’d finished his work for the day, he leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes. Her face bloomed in his mind, and he swallowed thickly.</p><p>His blue eyes opened and they cut to the article on his desk. There was a photograph of Hermione in a little black dress and kitten heels, her bare legs folded on a velvet sofa. Against his will, his eyes slid along her slim calves, eyeing the bit of thigh bare to his gaze. His jaw muscles clenched as he felt his blood pumping violently in his veins.</p><p>He closed his eyes again. His cock was hard, throbbing against his gray tweed trousers. He swallowed again, shaking his head.</p><p>Absolutely not.</p><p>He’d never be able to look the witch in the eye as her boss if he’d rubbed one off thinking about her.</p><p>He stood and threw on his robes. He’d walk it off. Then, he’d go home and have a glass of Ogden’s, and call it a night.</p><p> </p><hr/><p><br/>Walburga Black walked into Maximillian’s bedroom. It was decorated expensively, as the rest of the house was. It reflected very little of Dolohov’s personality, and more of his mother’s refined taste.</p><p>The Dolohovs lived a few streets over from the Blacks, making it rather convenient for Walburga to see Max. He rarely came to her house. Her parents would’ve blanched at the sight of him, given that the only people she was allowed to see since the duel were Druella Rosier and Orion Black. Druella was away at Hogwarts now, so her life had been rather boring of late. She was allowed to go out for short trips or outings alone, always on some pretext of fetching fresh cut flowers or visiting Carkitt for potions ingredients. They were errands the house elves could do, but Irma knew that Walburga would surely snap if she didn’t get out of Grimmauld for a space every day.</p><p>She used her daily outing as an excuse to see Dolohov.</p><p>His parents spent most of their days abroad. They’d leave for months at a time, visiting their French and Italian relatives, wintering on the riviera, summering in the vineyards of Sicily and Sardinia, and then rounding off the year with a tour of several Slavic countries, in which many of their relatives also dwelled. His mother was a very proper, sharp-witted pureblood witch, with ties to the ancient Roman and Sicilian bloodlines. She hoped he would marry a pureblooded Italian witch, and never failed to be disappointed when he rejected her invitation to travel with them. She found the British families distasteful, particularly the “brazen London witches”, but she faithfully stayed in Great Britain for his father. </p><p>She would have lashed Dolohov with a fiery whip if she knew he was fucking Walburga Black. It made Walburga want him even more.</p><p>Did she love Max? She wasn’t sure if she felt that way about him, but she did care about him. Their relationship was forbidden, and something about that excited Walburga and made her adrenaline rush.</p><p>He was home alone. She saw him lying in bed on his side with his back turned to her. She grinned and slipped out of her dress, then dipped onto the mattress and slid her arms around his sides. </p><p>He groaned. “<em>Fuck</em>, Walburga. Don’t touch me.”</p><p>He rolled over, and Walburga gasped. “What the hell happened to you, Max?”</p><p>“Riddle happened.”</p><p>Her eyes wandered his face, taking in the dark bruises that turned from black to blue to greenish around his eyes.  His lip was busted and his nose swollen. </p><p>“What in Salazar’s name <em> happened </em>?”</p><p>“Oh, I’m just Riddle’s punching bag, as usual.”</p><p>Walburga stared at him. He rolled over and sat up, and she moved quickly to place an extra pillow behind his shoulders as he leaned back with a wince. She eyed the bruises spanning his bare ribcage. He wore only his boxers and when he shifted, the sheet fell away from his legs and she took in the sight of the gruesome puckered scar on his thigh. “<em> Merlin </em>, Max.”</p><p>He gave her a grim look. “Say one bloody thing about Hermione Dumbledore and the sod turns into a raging beast.”</p><p>Her mouth fell open. “What did you say?”</p><p>“Hell if I remember. Something about her being an attention seeking cunt.”</p><p>Walburga laughed loudly before covering her mouth with her hand. She rubbed her lips together, fighting back a smirk. “Max, you’re insane.”</p><p>He groaned and shifted his weight. “It’s not like it isn’t true though.”</p><p>She tilted her head in agreement. “You’re not wrong. I can’t believe he did this.”</p><p>He shook his head incredulously, then winced. “I don’t know, Burgs. I think he’s lost the plot these days.”</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>“He’s distracted by that cunt. He did what he said he’d do, and she’s gone from the Prophet… but… she’s gone and got hired as an auror.”</p><p>Her eyes widened. “An <em> auror </em>?” Her mouth fell open. “She really is starving for attention, isn’t she?”</p><p>He nodded wryly. “So now Riddle’s got us dueling day in and day out, like a fucking madman. He’s nitpicking over every damned move we make. It’s almost like he thinks she’s coming after us.”</p><p>“Well, look at her articles.”</p><p>“Exactly. So what does he want with the cunt, then? I don’t understand it.”</p><p>She shook her head pensively, her eyebrows furrowing. “Neither do I.”</p><p>“Do you know what he said to Rosier?”</p><p>She lifted her eyebrows questioningly. </p><p>“I overheard them talking about blood purity. Said he thinks it’s on its way out.”</p><p>She cocked her head, her expression confused. “He said what’s on its way out?”</p><p>He met her gaze. “Blood purity.”</p><p>Her eyes widened. “<em> What </em>?”</p><p>“He said the ‘pool’s getting smaller.’”</p><p>She swallowed, her blue eyes narrowing with disgust. “He’s sounding like a blood traitor.”</p><p>He flicked his eyes at her. “Rosier got caught up with a half-blood witch and it’s almost as if Riddle’s trying to pacify him.”</p><p>Walburga’s eyes lowered. “Winnie Haywood, you mean?”</p><p>He nodded. </p><p>She was quiet for several moments. “I mean… Winnie’s a nice witch. She saved my arse in potions sixth year.”</p><p>He rolled his head on his shoulders and gazed at her with a sneer on his face. “So you think Rosier should sully his <em> immaculate </em> bloodline for a “nice” witch?”</p><p>“Well, no, of course not.” She looked at her hands. “I mean, we’ve all had moments of stupidity, I suppose. I would’ve married Riddle, and he’s a half-blood.”</p><p>Dolohov glared at her darkly. “So you’d break your engagement for Riddle, but not for me?”</p><p>She sighed and looked away.</p><p>His eyes roamed her side profile, examining her pouty lips and perfect bone structure. He’d imagined what their offspring would look like more times than he could count. He’d even considered faking the contraception charm. He wanted Walburga Black more than he wanted air in his lungs.</p><p>“I want you, Burgs.”</p><p>“I know,” she said coldly.</p><p>“Why are you here?”</p><p>“Because you’re the only person I can see without arousing my mother’s suspicion.”</p><p>“That’s not why.”</p><p>She turned back to him, staring at the awful bruising on his face. He was right. Tom had beat him like an animal. Walburga’s heart had iced over where Tom was concerned. That was one thing about Walburga Black: when she felt betrayed, there was no turning back. Once her loyalty was lost, it was gone for good. Although Tom Riddle had stepped on her heart, she would’ve stayed loyal if only for the sake of her family and social standing. She was fiercely loyal to the Black name, and if Tom’s cause would somehow elevate and solidify their legacy, she would have supported it. </p><p>But to hear him talking like a blood traitor? That was another story. The last line of connection between them would be severed if he turned his back on wizarding tradition, betraying his own bloodline and the old families. </p><p>“You’re deep in thought,” muttered Dolohov.</p><p>She nodded. “Mhmm.”</p><p>“What are you thinking about?”</p><p>Her lips parted. “Tom has always been on our side. He’s always believed magic is might. He even promised you once that he would eliminate muggleborns. Weren’t you talking once about a class system, when the statute came down?”</p><p>He tilted his head. “Well, yes… but that was long ago, back at Hogwarts.  Those were just late night ramblings in the common room.”</p><p>Her eyes slid back and forth behind narrowed eyelids. “But he still believed it. He was always on your side. So what has changed?”</p><p>His eyes narrowed. “I don’t know that it has, necessarily. It just seems as if he’s talking differently of late. Perhaps it’s merely musings. He’s the intellectual sort. Too philosophical for his own good, if you ask me.”</p><p>She stared into the fireplace, her blue eyes faraway. </p><p>“Why, Burgs? What’s on your mind?”</p><p>“I’ll tell you what’s changed, Max. It’s Hermione Dumbledore.”</p><p>He blinked three times, then replied, “I’m not following.”</p><p>“What if she’s muggleborn?”</p><p>His face twisted with confusion, then he winced and touched his sore jaw. “But Dumbledore’s a half-blood.”</p><p>“What about her mother?”</p><p>“Dagworth-Grangers. I thought they were mostly purebloods.”</p><p>Walburga’s brown knit and she hummed thoughtfully. “Don’t you think it’s rather odd that she just appeared out of nowhere?”</p><p>He gazed at her, his eyes narrowing. “A bit, yes.”</p><p>“What if there’s more to Hermione Dumbledore than meets the eye? I can’t see a reason why Tom would be changing his mind about these things. It doesn’t make any sense, Max.”</p><p>“Right,” he mumbled grimly. “I suppose I could look into it. Clearly the witch has her talons in him. You should have seen him. He was… well, I don’t know exactly what I saw. It’s like he wasn’t human.”</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>“It’s like he shifted into something else… he was too strong. I couldn’t even fight him off.” He gestured to his bulky muscular frame. “I’m twice his size, weight-wise.”</p><p>Walburga gazed at him, then lifted her hand and brushed her well-manicured fingertips over the stubble on his chin, tracing the bruises on his cheeks. He sucked in a sharp breath. “I’m sorry he did this.”</p><p>He matched her gaze with a heated stare of his own. “You could nurse me, be my healer.”</p><p>Her eyebrows shot up. “Could I?”</p><p>He nodded, his lips turning up to form a smirk. “You could sit on my cock and put those magnificent tits in my face. Then I think I’ll be cured.”</p><p>She laughed softly and whispered, “I can’t. I have to get back. Orion’s coming over.”</p><p>Dolohov’s smirk disappeared. “Are you seeing him now?”</p><p>She rolled her eyes. “He <em> is </em> my fiancée, Max.”</p><p>He scowled. “He’s your cousin.”</p><p>“So?”</p><p>“So…You have to admit, I’d give you more attractive children than that blasted git.”</p><p>She giggled. “Are you dreaming of having children with me now?”</p><p>“I’ll give you as many as you want.”</p><p>She rolled her eyes and started to roll away. “Lucky me.”</p><p>He caught her wrist. “Stay.”</p><p>“I can’t. I’m still on probation.”</p><p>He exhaled, then let her go. “Riddle hasn’t done anything, has he? To Cygnus?”</p><p>She swallowed, then stood. “No. I’m hoping he’s forgotten.”</p><p>“I’m sorry, Walburga. He tortured the memories out of me. The cruciatus.”</p><p>“It’s alright.” She slipped her dress back on and looked back at him. “Did he say anything? When he saw… when he saw us together?”</p><p>He shook his head. “No, Walburga. He really only cared about our conversations about his little whore.”</p><p>Her eyes fell. “Right.”</p><p>“If he does anything to Ciggy, I don’t know what I’ll do, Burgs.” Dolohov swallowed thickly, struggling to speak with the swelling in his face. “I could handle his curses, his demands and his threats. But if he turns blood traitor… I suppose that would be it for me.”</p><p>She stared into the fireplace. “What would you do, though? He’s too powerful, Max.”</p><p>He shook his head. “I suppose the others would have to be on board. I’m not quite there yet. I think if we could eliminate his distraction, he’d get his head screwed back on. But that’s the issue, innit? He’s fucking obsessed with her. He’d probably burn me alive if I lifted a single bloody finger to her.” He sighed. “One alternatve, if he goes blood traitor… is to turn over the evidence to the Ministry. Chuck his arse in Azkaban and be done with it.”</p><p>“Do you think Azkaban could even hold him?”</p><p>Dolohov blinked. “I don't know, to be honest. When the Knights formed back at Hogwarts, I never imagined he’d ever become as powerful as he is. Sometimes it feels like I’ve chained myself to something that I can never come out of alive.”</p><p>“You don’t think he’d let you go?”</p><p>Dolohov shook his head. “He’d kill me.”</p><p>She was quiet for a few minutes, then she spoke gravely. “Something needs to be done about Hermione Dumbledore.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“Either she’s not who she says she is, or she’s filling his head with nonsense.”</p><p>“I don’t suppose there’s a way to find out.”</p><p>Walburga was deep in thought, then replied, “Maybe you could speak with the others?”</p><p>He shook his head. “I don’t think so. After that last meeting, I think they’re all pissed with me. They’re too afraid of Riddle to entertain any other mutinies.” He heaved a deep breath, then grimaced, running his hand over his ribs. “He’s quite a skilled manipulator, Burgs. He’s either got them all twisted up with fear or convinced he’s going to hand them the muggle world on a silver platter.”</p><p>“Do you need me to obliviate you?”</p><p>He flicked his eyes to her and then nodded.</p><p>“Can’t he retrieve them again?”</p><p>“I don’t think he will. He probably thinks I’d be daft to do anything else. Besides, if he uses the cruciatus on me again, he’s going to cause some permanent damage. I think he’s going to give it a break for a while.” He gestured to the bruises with a bitter smile. “Thus the muggle arse-beating.”</p><p>She rolled her eyes and raised her wand to his temple.</p><p>“When will I see you again, Burgs?”</p><p>Her stomach fluttered at the intensity with which his chocolate brown eyes rested on her. </p><p>“In a few days, Max. Obliviate.”</p>

<p> </p><p>Gaspard arrived at the Ministry early, as he had a meeting scheduled with the Minister and her advisors. She had questioned him about his department’s agenda for the week, and then checked up on his progress toward hiring more purebloods in his office. He was already irritated when he made his way to courtroom ten, where the Wizengamot was gearing up for the day. He presented key evidence which would be used in the day’s hearings, and then made his way up the elevator, back to Level 2. </p><p>When he arrived at the DMLE, he was greeted by a flood of post, all regarding his hiring of Hermione Dumbledore as an auror, courtesy of the latest article in <em> Witch Weekly</em>.</p><p>Gaspard took a deep breath, attempting to curb his annoyance as he poured himself a coffee and got to work. Eustace began to brief him on new cases of improper magic usage. </p><p>“Oh, and sir, we’ve made a bit of headway in the British Historical Society robbery.”</p><p>Gaspard cocked an eyebrow. “Go on.”</p><p>“As you suggested,” Bones began, “The Historical Society brought in a team from the Bureau of Enchanted Artifacts in Germany to examine the wards. They found something rather interesting in one of the offices.” Bones handed him a photograph of an antique, three-sided cabinet.</p><p>His eyes narrowed. “What’s this?”</p><p>“This cabinet was a gift given to the Historical Society only a few days prior to the robbery by a local antique dealer with a shop located on Knockturn Alley, Caractacus Burke.”</p><p>Gaspard’s eyebrows instantly shot up. Burke was the owner of a shop called Borgin and Burkes. Incidentally, Dufresne recalled from his file that Tom Riddle worked at that particular shop. “Go on, Bones.”</p><p>“One of the Bureau’s team recognized the cabinet as an antique Vanishing cabinet made by a Dutch craftsman by the name of Joost Schrijin. They were rather popular during the goblin rebellion in 1890, but when Joost passed away, the cabinets became rarities. In the 20s, a muggle stumbled upon a pair of the cabinets and began using them for magic shows where he’d vanish his assistant, therefore the Ministry placed a regulation on Vanishing cabinets. It was revoked in 1932. The Bureau says the cabinets are beginning to regain popularity as another craftsman in Germany is studying the enchantments woven into the woodwork in order to build new ones. They come in pairs, and they create a sort of passage between them which can override any protective enchantments. The timing of the cabinet’s arrival and the robbery are rather uncanny.”</p><p>Gaspard blinked, his eyes narrowing. “Indeed.” He examined the photo of the cabinet. “Where is its mate?”</p><p>Eustace shook his head. “That we do not know. The issue is, the cabinet on the other side must be opened in order for us to discover its location. Also, the Bureau worker said that it appears that this cabinet may be broken.”</p><p>“Broken?”</p><p>Eustace nodded. </p><p>Gaspard’s eyes narrowed. “Weren’t the wards at the museum dismantled?”</p><p>“It appears so.”</p><p>Gaspard stood and straightened his tie, then strapped on his leather shoulder harness on which he kept his wand holster and badge. He took up his robes, then muttered, “Give Dumbledore something to do until I get back. I’m going down there.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>An hour later, Gaspard took the elevator back up to Level 2. He had examined the wards at the museum again, as well as the cabinet, and now needed to talk to Bones. He decided they would go to Borgin &amp; Burkes and question the owner later.</p><p>“Mr. Bones,” he called sharply as he re-entered the auror department. “In my office.”</p><p>His pulse jumped sharply as he passed by Hermione Dumbledore, seated at a cubicle of her own and reading a training manual. He caught a faint whiff of her lavender fragrance as he walked by, but he didn’t spare a glance her way.</p><p>He entered the office with Eustace and shut the door.</p><p>“The wards were tampered with on purpose,” he muttered.</p><p>“Sir?”</p><p>“The Historical Society was assumed to have been broken into through its side doors. The best wards and protective enchantments in Britain, and they were all dismantled - but from the <em> inside</em>. There was one mechanism which was undetectable by detection charms - a muggle lock, on the outside of the doors. It had not been tampered with. We had initially assumed that it had been unlocked by someone who had access to the Historical Society, perhaps one of their workers or a relative, someone who had access to the key, or that maybe it had been left unlocked, but apparently those doors are never used and the lock is rarely unlocked except for special events. I even thought it possible that the lock could’ve been picked by muggle methods. But it would’ve taken extra time to lock it back, and once the wards were dismantled with, it set off an alarm charm which summoned the security wizards. According to them, they apparated to the scene in less than a minute after the alarms were activated. The thief was gone by then. Whoever did this, they knew about the alarms, and they tampered with the wards on purpose to draw attention away from the cabinet, and then immediately left. But they didn’t know about the lock on the outside of the doors, because they’d entered from inside the building. They never broke in through the doors.” He pressed his tongue against his cheek, his eyes narrowing as if in deep thought. “The cabinet was put in an office near the side doors, which is why they tampered with the wards there instead of the back or front. It was quicker for them to get back to the cabinet that way.”</p><p>Eustace looked confused. “But if the thief was capable of dismantling the wards in the first place, and with that kind of speed, why would they use the cabinet to begin with? Couldn't they just break in?”</p><p>Gaspard sat down at his desk and leaned forward on his elbows. “There’s an anti-apparation zone around the entire building. I imagine they knew that. Besides, they probably wanted assurance that they could get out quickly if they ran into trouble.”</p><p>“Seems strange that they would dismantle the wards just to throw attention away from the cabinet. The robbery may not have been discovered for weeks if they hadn’t even touched them.”</p><p>Gaspard leaned back in his chair, turning his cedar wand over and over in his hands. “They did it in hopes we wouldn’t notice the cabinet. They clearly didn’t want the cabinet traced back to them.” He ran a hand over his chin thoughtfully. </p><p>“But… what of the cabinet being broken?”</p><p>He seemed deep in thought. “That I don’t know. Unless someone broke it after the robbery.” He narrowed his eyes. “Get me a list of every employee at the Historical Society.”</p><p>“Do you want to question Burke?” asked Eustace.</p><p>Gaspard gave a curt nod. “Soon. I don’t want to alert him yet; I may be able to get a wand warrant. I’m going to have to draft some paperwork first. Can you send Dumbledore in?”</p><p>“Certainly, sir.” The auror backed out of the room.</p><p>Gaspard contemplated whether to question Hermione about the cabinet and Tom Riddle. After deliberating, he decided against it, considering it a potential conflict of interest. Gaspard was good enough at his job without putting her in a difficult position almost as soon as she’d joined the force.</p><p>He also didn’t put it past her yet not to warn him.</p><p>A moment later, the door opened.</p><p>“You wanted to see me, Mr. Dufresne?”</p><p>Gaspard didn’t look up, but gestured to the chair in front of him. “Yes, Dumbledore, come in and have a seat.”</p><p>Hermione’s heels clicked on the sleek black floor and she ran her hand over her skirt before sitting.</p><p>Gaspard looked up, but he was never quite prepared to see her wide doe eyes looking back at him. He schooled his features into a blank mask and began, “You finished all of your assessments and I’m impressed. You did even better than I thought you would do, particularly at your age, and I mean no offense by that. It is rather rare to exceed my expectations.”</p><p>“None taken.”</p><p>“You can bypass a great deal of our auror training. It looks as if you’ll still need to take the Auror Advantage. It’s an introductory course, it only takes a week to complete. You’ll have to do some field training with Mr. Bones and Constance Pickering. You’ve bypassed Poisons and Antidotes and Concealment and Disguise, and you’ve partially bypassed Stealth and Tracking, although you will still need to complete the hands-on training portion.”</p><p>He examined her results. “All in all, you’ve passed nearly every written test with flying colors. You’ve got an impressive understanding of concealment charms and protective enchantments, and I’m rather taken aback by your knowledge of tracking spells and the Fidelius charm. When presented with hypothetical scenarios, you nearly always had a resourceful solution. I looked over your essay answers personally.” He leaned forward, folding his hands on his desk. His blue eyes pierced her. “How did you learn this stuff, Hermione? This is extremely advanced, and not only that… but judging by your answers, it seems as if this is not just theoretical knowledge for you. You’ve lived it, haven’t you?”</p><p>Hermione blinked several times, her heart rate speeding. “Well, yes. I know Dumbledore told you that I… fought, in a war.”</p><p>He sat staring at her for a few moments. “What sort of things did you experience, Miss Dumbledore?”</p><p>Her lips parted. “I don’t know whether I should reveal too much. I was… sort of on a secret mission. For Dumbledore, with two of my friends. We were on the run, searching for some… objects. Magical artifacts, you could say. We had to stay hidden for a long time. We found ourselves in some very sticky situations a few times, since we were being hunted. We were captured once. I was tortured. We had to break into Gringotts once. Er… we had to ride a <em>dragon</em> just to get out alive. Then… we fought in a battle… at Hogwarts. Many people died.” </p><p>Her gaze was distant, fixed on a corner of the ceiling. Somehow, saying it all out loud made it all feel less real, as if she were retelling an ancient, bygone fairytale.</p><p>Here, in the year 1949, the life she’d come from seemed so far removed. Now she’d somehow fallen for the very man who caused so much death and destruction. The thought made her inwardly cringe. No matter how she felt about Tom, that was one reality she couldn’t escape, and nothing would ever make her feel better about it.</p><p>What had Ron and Harry thought when they discovered she was gone? Had they spent months looking for her? </p><p>Gaspard cleared his throat. “How soon after the battle did you travel back in time?”</p><p>Her lips parted. “Two months.”</p><p>He froze, his eyes locked on her face. “You went to Dumbledore immediately, I presume?”</p><p>She nodded. </p><p>He stroked his chin thoughtfully. “Then you began working at the Prophet straightaway?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>He took a deep breath. “Two months is not enough time to process something like that.”</p><p>She looked at her hands. “With all due respect, Gaspard, I’ve never known anything different.” She lifted her gaze to his. “The past seven years of my life have been one big build up to war.” She bit her lip. “I’m sorry, I forgot. I should address you as Mr. Dufresne.”</p><p>“Don’t worry about it, Hermione. I think we’re past it.” His expression was unreadable. “Just, try to remember it in work settings.” When her eyes met his questioningly, he gestured to the paper on his desk. “The papers are already having a field day. Don’t want to add anymore fuel to the fire, if you know what I mean.”</p><p>She smiled. “I’m afraid the papers won’t let up anytime soon. They simply love to create elaborate romantic entanglements out of any wizard I’m seen with for longer than five minutes.”</p><p>He didn’t smile. He was indeed very stoic, but she felt comfortable around him. She didn’t feel that she needed to put up a front or be someone that she wasn’t. He was authentically himself, and she felt that she could also be herself.</p><p>“Dumbledore informed me that it would be in all of our best interests if I didn’t ask too many questions about your previous life and its events. So if I ask you something that you don’t feel comfortable answering, you need only say so.”</p><p>Hermione nodded gratefully. “Thank you, sir.”</p><p>Gaspard nodded, his eyes flicking over her briefly. “You’ll continue to study your materials, and you’ll be taking Battle Instinct with me three days a week. You’ll take the introductory course with Jack McClaggen, and you’ll start some of your field training next week. I’ll keep you on a rotation so you can familiarize yourself with the other aurors.” He glanced at her again. </p><p>Hermione noticed. “Is there something else?”</p><p>He cleared his throat. “You took an oath to this department. To do everything in your power to protect the citizens of magical Britain and to uphold the laws set forth by the ministry.”</p><p>She nodded slowly. “Yes.”</p><p>He gazed at her searchingly. “Good. I’m just reminding you of that. Because you may one day find your personal loyalties challenged by that oath.” </p><p>Hermione blinked, turning her head slightly, her eyes still locked on his. “What personal loyalties are you referring to?”</p><p>“Any of them.”</p><p>She swallowed. “Mr. Dufresne… I’ll be quite honest with you. When I found myself here, in the past… which of course, is <em>your</em> <em>present</em>… I was quite disillusioned with the Ministry. You see, in the future, the Ministry was easily corrupted, and the minds of the public were easily swayed. I told myself I’d do whatever I had to do to mold the present in order to make a better tomorrow. I didn’t include working for the ministry in that plan. I don’t particularly hold the Ministry, nor politicians, in a high regard. I took this position because I trust you, and Dumbledore trusts you, and because I believe you have the wizarding world’s best interest at heart."</p><p>"But what I found during my own time is that sometimes doing the right thing meant going against the Ministry. We never would’ve won the war if we hadn’t. When you make the top of the list of the Ministry's Undesirables, you learn that you have to sometimes take things into your own hands.” She took a deep breath. “What I’m saying is that I’m loyal to you, and to Dumbledore, and as long as you’re over this department, I’ll follow orders to the best of my ability. But if you want to know what I’m <em> really </em> doing here, I suppose you can view me as an operative. But <em>not</em> one assigned by the ministry.”</p><p>He leaned forward, eyeing her closely. “Miss Dumbledore, are you committed to putting this dark wizard gang in Azkaban?”</p><p>She nodded eagerly. “Absolutely, sir. I’ll do whatever I can.”</p><p>His expression was cool and aloof. “And what if I have to imprison Tom Riddle?”</p><p>Hermione felt her heart stop. Her eyes wandered his face, but there was no window into his mind. For the first time since she’d been in the past, she attempted legilimency. She locked eyes with him, and brushed up against his mental walls with her magic, but they were cold steel, the walls of his mind impenetrable and endless.</p><p>He ran his tongue over his top teeth, then muttered, “What are you hoping to find, Dumbledore?”</p><p>She said nothing. She merely gazed at him, frozen.</p><p>He leaned forward. “Answer my question, trainee.”</p><p>She swallowed. "Which question?"</p><p>His jaw tensed. "What will you say if I have to imprison Tom Riddle?"</p><p>"Why would I care about Tom Riddle?"</p><p>Gaspard took a deep breath, exhaling through his nose. He seemed uncomfortable. "Hermione... The minister knows about your private relationship."</p><p>Hermione froze. </p><p>Gaspard stared at her, his expression masked. "I don't like to bring up personal matters, Dumbledore, but where there could potentially be a conflict of interest, I <em>have</em> to broach the topic."</p><p>"I understand." She looked down at her hands. "Well... we aren't in a relationship anymore."</p><p>His face was stone, unchangeable and cold, gazing at her with glacial blue eyes.</p><p>She swallowed. “As for Riddle... I suppose I’d say that if you're going to attempt it, then you’d better have a damn good cell to put him in, because he’ll be harder to hold onto than Gellert Grindelwald himself.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Tom walked into Wilhelmina Tuft’s office, resembling a vampire with his sharply tailored black suit, a dark red tie (the only red he owned), and a black cloak which swept about his person theatrically. His skin was paler than normal, and his eyes shone scarlet red.</p><p>“Hello, Wilhelmina.”</p><p>She looked up and almost smiled before she caught sight of him. Her smile faded. </p><p>He grinned slowly, his lips pulling back over bright white teeth, creasing his chiseled cheeks handsomely. </p><p>Her breathing was deep and heavy as she took in his appearance. Then, she offered the slight tilt of her head. “Hello, Tom.” She swallowed, then added a little breathlessly, “Thank you for coming.”</p><p>He nodded once. Their eyes locked, and her gaze lingered on his red eyes.</p><p>“I wanted to apologize, Mr. Riddle. My behavior at our last meeting left something to be desired, I’m afraid. I was not at my best that day. I hope you will forgive me for my ill-timed threats.”</p><p>His lips twitched slightly. “No need to sweat it, Minister,” he said, crossing his ankle over his knee. “I’ve had a few bad days myself lately.”</p><p>“Oh,” she mewled, her eyes warming a fraction. “I’m sorry to hear that.”</p><p>His eyes narrowed. “Yes. It’s unfortunate, really. I tend to get edgy when I’m having a bad day. I have a tendency to get… violent.”</p><p>Her lips came together sharply. "Then, for your followers' sakes, I hope your days improve." She gave him a tight smile. “I intended to invite you to Tuft Manor this Saturday, for a dinner I’m hosting.”</p><p>“You could’ve owled me about that.”</p><p>She cleared her throat. “Well, I… I wanted to apologize in person… and I wanted to see you. To wish you well with Miss Dumbledore.”</p><p>His expression was as calm and placid as the arctic ocean. “We aren’t together anymore.”</p><p>Her eyebrows rose. “<em>Oh</em>.”</p><p>He sat gazing at her with narrowed eyes, their ruby irises unnervingly sinister. </p><p>Wilhelmina’s heart sped up considerably. “I didn’t know that.” She looked down at her hands. “I did notice she quit<em> The Prophet </em>.”</p><p>He nodded silently. </p><p>“Well,” she murmured, looking away. “I do hope you can attend. The dinner, that is.”</p><p>“We’ll see.” </p><p>He stood without a word, and turned to leave.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>When Tom got back to his flat, he swung his cloak from his shoulders and ripped his tie off. He unbuttoned the top button of his shirt and began to spread several scrolls out on his rickety dining room table. It was his day off, and he’d just visited the Nott Manse in south London to retrieve the genealogy scrolls of the Pure-Blood Directory, written by Acacius’ father, Cantankerus Nott. </p><p>He had read and re-read the article Hermione had written whose headline read, “<em>Blood Purity Stifles Genetic Code” say Muggle Scientists.</em></p><p>When it had first been published a year ago, Tom had read the headline with no small amount of irritation, and his prejudice against her Dumbledore blood had prevented him from reading it. He had hated Hermione then, and the irony wasn't lost on him how dramatically things had changed in one year.</p><p>He chuckled at the voracity with which he'd wanted to murder her.</p><p>Now, the articles which he found so distasteful and even dangerous at the time, were pricking his curiosity. </p><p>Since Hermione was from the future, Tom assumed that both science and magical theory had progressed quite a bit since 1949. Presumably, Hermione was well-studied on the subject, as she was on every subject, just like Tom. He viewed her as somewhat of an intellectual equal, a peer of similar acumen and academic achievement. She had raised some brilliant questions in the article, leading Tom to speculate.</p><p>Tom was nothing if not a realist. His intellectual side was brimming with questions.</p><p>Was magical blood being stifled by blood purity standards? Was keeping their blood pure actually destroying their genetic lines?</p><p>Hermione’s article had prompted Tom to study muggle science. He was particularly fascinated with chemistry, physics, and anatomy, all of which mirrored some magical principles. He latched onto the discovery of three muggle scientists, Julius Robert von Mayer, James Prescott Joule, and Hermann von Helmholtz, a team which had formulated a basic principle stating that energy could be neither created nor destroyed.</p><p>Magic, Tom hypothesized, was a form of energy. Where had it come from? He wasn’t sure, but his theory was that a particular amount of magic existed in the universe and when a wizard perished, as Hausler had suspected, it had to go somewhere. The wizarding world was naught but a swapping, sharing, and channeling of magical energy. Tom had learned to conduct it, to <em> wield </em> this energy, whereas many wizards only learned spells from spellbooks. Formulas, but not the ability to create new methods of using magic.</p><p>Tom had long wondered where muggleborns got their magical powers. If not from blood, then where?</p><p>His theory was that if magical bloodlines were somehow becoming sterile, and their numbers dwindling, then the magic typically housed within those bloodlines which had been passed down for centuries… it had to <em> go </em> somewhere.</p><p>Hausler had said that some of it became encased in the bones of the deceased witch or wizard, but that the rest of it… the rest of it returned to the earth. Was it somehow being recycled through death and rebirth? When magic couldn’t be passed down through blood, was it then creating new magical bloodlines… through muggles?</p><p>He unfurled the scrolls, and began to study them. He examined them deep into the night, making notes as he went.</p><p>Just before bed, Tom decided it was time to check on Hermione. He set aside the scrolls and texts and retreated into his bedroom.</p><p>One of Hermione’s nightgowns still lay across his chair. He hadn’t moved it, and he didn’t intend to. He would leave it there, exactly as she left it, as if it were a symbol of their relationship… waiting to be picked back up and resumed as usual.</p><p>There was a pair of her knickers still laying on the floor by her side of the bed, casually tossed aside after he’d slid them from her thighs. He’d stared at them for a week, but he couldn’t bring himself to move them. </p><p>Her items had become a part of the integrity of the room.</p><p>Tom stood at the foot of his bed, gazing at the spot where she’d always lain. He needed to know where she was and what she was doing. It was a compulsive itch that he could no longer fight. What state would he find her in?</p><p>He had to know that she was alright.</p><p>There was a force inexplicably drawing him to her. It was overwhelming his body, his mind, his nerves. He could hardly breathe beneath its forceful insistence.</p><p>He desperately needed to see her... if only just to ensure that she still existed in his world, that she wasn't just some figment of his imagination. He sometimes dreamed that she was pulled back into her own world and permanently separated from him, never to return. He dreaded those dreams. He always woke in a panic, bathed in sweat.</p><p>He marked the runes in a circle on the wood floor, then fell back upon the bed, casting his soul out of his body.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Hermione had wrapped up her studying for the night and had finished the final edits on her spellbook. She’d been combing through old texts and Miranda Goshawk’s entire series, looking for spells she might have missed. The spellbook was rather comprehensive and she’d even added some spells of her own. </p><p>Everything was progressing perfectly, but she found herself rather tense of late and unable to focus. </p><p>She hadn’t realized how much she’d come to rely on Tom’s presence.</p><p>He’d always joked with her about her “voracious sexual appetite” and he likely did it to tease her, but of late she’d begun to realize that perhaps he was right. Going so suddenly from daily orgasms to none at all had her body so tense and tight that she could hardly focus on work. It was almost as if their sex life had allowed her to work all the more vigorously.</p><p>The reality was that she missed him and it was killing her.</p><p>She had been angry at him. She was angry at him… and she did plan to go after him and his death eaters. </p><p>But the things that Gaspard had said today… They  made her nervous. When it came down to it, did she really want Riddle in Azkaban?</p><p>She felt the weight of the world on her shoulders. No matter what she did, she never felt that she was making the right choices. Every path seemed rife with error and turmoil. Hermione was torn between what her heart wanted and what she knew was right.</p><p>She sighed and undressed. She had a long day ahead of her tomorrow, and she needed to get some sleep. She slipped her nightgown over her head and then slid into bed. </p><p>She lay there for several minutes, her eyes shut tight, trying to sleep. The opalescent moon was full and bright and filtered into her bedroom through the floor-to-ceiling windows. She opened her eyes again, staring at the ornate crown molding. </p><p>She saw Riddle’s face, the pale skin and sharp cheekbones. She imagined the charming, mysterious smirk that often turned up his lips, and his glittering black eyes beneath dark lashes and curly black hair.</p><p>Hermione threw her arm over her eyes and took a deep breath. She’d purposely kept herself busy for the past week with her studies, but it seemed that tonight, thoughts of Tom were unavoidable.</p><p>If he were here, he would’ve smoked a cigarette on the terrace, then come back inside and sat before the fire, deeply engrossed in a book, reading in his own little bubble while she worked at her desk. Then, at precisely ten o’ clock, he would’ve stood and taken off his tie, then his shirt, then his shoes, then his belt and trousers, and he would have folded them in that signature style of his on one of the armchairs in her bedroom. He would’ve walked to the bathroom in his boxers and brushed his teeth. He would’ve gotten into bed and pulled her into his arms. She’d have laid on his chest while his fingertips stroked her arms and the space between her shoulder blades. She would’ve traced the runes etched into his shoulder until her eyes began to droop with sleep. He would’ve still been staring at the ceiling. He was always the last to fall asleep, and the first to wake. She suspected that he spent the time after she fell asleep thinking and plotting. It was perhaps another of his compulsions, that he had to recount the day, examining the events of the day and editing his plans before he could allow himself to rest. </p><p>She let her rage subside for the moment, because she desperately wanted to think about him. After all, the past week he’d sat in the very back of her mind, ever present as she went about her day. It’s like he never went away no matter what she did, no matter what she focused on.</p><p>Some evenings she and Tom wouldn’t have gone to sleep straight away. Sometimes his eyes would wander her body, as if taking stock of her. He seemed to want to reacquaint himself with her body on a daily basis. He’d trace the curves of her breasts with his fingertips, taking them in his hands, reveling in the simple pleasure of touching her. Most of the time he was rushed and violent, but on occasion, he was slow and gentle, savoring each sensation with an almost worshipful reverence. Every glance was an ascension… every touch, a prayer. </p><p>He’d bury his face in her hair and breathe in her scent, his long fingers stroking her thighs with painstaking slowness. Hermione replayed their nights in her mind, finding that she could remember each one independently. They all stood out as unique. </p><p>She thought of one such night. He’d whispered in her ear, “You’re my witch, Hermione. Mine. Do you even realize how perfectly matched we are? I think you were made for me.”</p><p>He’d kissed his way down her inner thigh, muttering a steady stream of praise.</p><p>“Your body is beautiful, Hermione.”</p><p>“I love the way you tremble when I touch you there.”</p><p>“You’re perfect for me, little witch… so fucking <em>perfect</em>.”</p><p>Was she wrong in thinking that he could never change? He had seemed to change his stance on blood purity… but was it real? Or was it simply for her sake? Did he actually understand <em>why</em> it was wrong?</p><p>She thought of one of the last nights they’d spent together. He’d woken her in the middle of the night with his lips on her throat, snaking his hand between her thighs and sliding his fingers inside her. It hadn’t taken long for her wetness to coat his fingers.</p><p>“Open your mouth,” he’d instructed before slipping his fingers in her mouth. “I want you to taste how wet you are for me.”</p><p>She missed his voice. It was dark and commanding, and nothing like the raspy voice of Lord Voldemort. It sent shivers down her spine every time he whispered in her ear.</p><p>Hermione’s hands wandered between her legs. She touched herself, biting her lip as she felt her warm liquid coating her fingertips. Just the thought of him reignited a fire in her body, as if the coals were still burning for him, waiting to be fanned. </p><p>She parted her lips and sucked in a deep breath as she pushed her fingers inside herself, imagining they were his. His hands were her favorite thing about Tom, but there really wasn’t much she disliked. If she were to make a pros and cons list, the list of pros would be a mile long, with the cons list only reading “<em>Voldemort</em>.”</p><p>She sighed and let her eyes drift shut. She could allow herself this. Riddle was like an addiction, after all. She would have to let go of him slowly.</p><p>She thought of his long, pale fingers, always so cool and slightly calloused from writing. She imagined them inside her, curling slightly and pumping in and out of her, and his distinctive voice in her ear, whispering,<em> Say it, Hermione. Say my name.</em></p><p>“Tom,” she breathed shallowly.</p><p>
<em> Say it all, little witch. </em>
</p><p>“I’m yours,” she whispered as she slid her fingers up and over her clit, circling it slowly. “Forever.”</p><p>
<em> Good girl. </em>
</p><p>She had a million whispers in her heart, every phrase he’d ever uttered to her filed away in her mind. </p><p>She brought her other hand up and let it encircle her throat, resting there as his always did, like a necklace. </p><p>“Tom,” she whispered as she moved her fingers faster. </p><p>
<em> What, baby? </em>
</p><p>“Fuck,” she whimpered, lost in her fantasy. “I love you.”</p><p>She let herself say it, here, alone in the dark.</p><p>The whispers in her mind paused, and she could imagine him stopping, gazing at her with those bottomless obsidian eyes.</p><p>
<em> You have me, little witch. You could have me, even now... Stop running.  </em>
</p><p>She shook her head, swallowing. “Not like this…”</p><p>She imagined his face the last time they had spoken, twisted with raw emotion. “I love you… and I don’t think… I don’t think I’m capable of doing it properly.”</p><p>Her imagination ran wild, flashes of their nights together playing in her mind like a film reel. </p><p>
<em> She was straddling his face, his tongue buried inside her, his hands gripping her thighs roughly, pressing her down onto his lips as she gripped the headboard tightly… </em>
</p><p>
<em> Tom was seated in an armchair before the fireplace. Hermione was changing, but the look in Tom’s eyes made her stop. “On your knees, Dumbledore,” he’d said, his deep voice hoarse with lust. “Crawl to me…” </em>
</p><p>Her fingers moved faster. She tightened her grip on her throat, imagining his hand flexing around her windpipe.</p><p>She gently canted her hips against her fingers, feeling her inner walls tightening.</p><p>“Tom,” she moaned. “Tom, please…”</p><p>
<em> Please, what, darling? </em>
</p><p>She shook her head. She didn’t know what she was pleading for.</p><p>“I love you,” she rasped hoarsely, “so much I can’t breathe…”</p><p>Her entire body tensed, her muscles tightening and her breath catching as she approached the precipice. Her pleasure heightened and crested, her skin flushing with heat. She moaned, sucking in a deep breath only to release it all in one jagged exhale, her body thrumming with a wave of euphoria. </p><p>Her walls pulsed around her fingers as she released a broken cry.</p><p>
<em> You’ll always be mine, little witch. I will have you again. When you’re ready... I’ll come for you. </em>
</p><p>His voice was so familiar that she could hardly believe she was imagining it. She shook her head, out of breath. “No,” she breathed, her chest heaving as she drifted down from the cosmos of release.</p><p>But the voice had gone silent.</p><p>One tear escaped from the corner of her eye, and a silent sob caught in the back of her throat.</p><p>She was alone with the crackling fire and the pale moonlight, but the satisfaction and relief she thought she would feel was nowhere to be found.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Tom awoke, back in his body once more, and sat straight up. He immediately dropped his head into his hands. </p><p>It was dark in his bedroom save for the glowing red circle of runes around his bed.</p><p>He exhaled sharply, feeling an uncomfortable tightness in his chest.</p><p>Seeing Hermione in that state caused a strange mixture of arousal and deep abandonment in Tom.</p><p>How could his witch lay there in the darkness of her bedroom, moaning his name as she touched herself… but still refuse to come to him?</p><p>He gritted his teeth at her stubbornness, and ran his fingers through his hair in frustration.</p><p>“Fuck her,” he whispered angrily. He stood and made his way across the room in measured strides. The room was lit with an eerie, scarlet glow. </p><p>He leaned against the chest of drawers. On its surface sat his Gaunt ring. He glared at it. He was reminded that if he wasn’t going to wear it, he should probably hide it away somewhere, protected by enchantments. Perhaps in the cave. He intended to make another trip to Albania, to learn the creation of Inferi from Zephyris. Then, he would be able to use them to protect his horcruxes.</p><p>He gazed at the ring. He would put an enchantment on it, one that would curse anyone who tried to wear it. It was a new curse, and Tom had created it himself; he’d molded it from the dark magic he housed in his body, instilling it intuitively into a chant until he had felt the curse take formation.</p><p>He liked to think he was a pioneer in the realm of intuitive magic, but he knew there were other witches and wizards from his bloodline who were notorious for the creation of unique dark curses.</p><p>Herpo… Slytherin.. Gormlaith Gaunt.</p><p>He’d gotten the idea from Hermione’s ring… the one given to her by Dumbledore. Tom had a strong suspicion about that ring and its enchantments. He couldn’t be sure, but he’d learned about legendary enchanted objects, particularly pieces of jewelry… items that could protect the wearer against any spells. One such artifact was called the Ring of Dispel. It had been given to Lancelot by the Lady of the Lake. Tom had done research on enchanted rings after feeling a rare and ancient type of magic upon the ring Hermione wore. Tom suspected that she may even bear the Ring of Dispel itself.</p><p>Tom didn’t want to wear his Gaunt ring now. </p><p>He didn’t want Hermione wearing Dumbledore’s ring either. He wanted her to wear his ring.</p><p>A wedding ring.</p><p>But if Dumbledore’s ring had a certain protective enchantment woven into it… then Tom would not be outdone.</p><p>He would simply have to find a ring of similar power for Hermione, or he would have one crafted and enchant it himself… provided she didn’t still have her lacy little knickers in a twist.</p><p>He took up his horcrux and placed it in the top drawer, which was warded and spelled to make objects seemingly disappear, causing the drawer to appear empty to any but the one who knew its contents. He would move it soon to a more permanent hiding place.</p><p>He was still unsure whether Hermione knew about his horcruxes or not. He’d asked her many things about the future which she’d conceded the answers to, but there really hadn’t been a good way to ask her about the horcruxes without alerting her to their existence.</p><p>The creation of a horcrux was debatably the darkest piece of magic one could engage in.</p><p>Tom wasn’t sure he was ready for her to know, considering how she’d reacted over the ritual at Riddle House.</p><p>He took a deep breath, then grabbed his cigarettes. He walked back to the bed and sat, lighting one, letting the cherry spark and flicker in the deep red ambience of the room.</p><p>He bent one knee and draped his arm over it, then took another deep drag, breathing the smoke deeply into his lungs before expelling it slowly.</p><p>“Hermione Jean Riddle,” he whispered, his voice somewhat hoarse from tiredness. </p><p>Tom had never liked his name. Every time it was used, it reminded him of his father. He greatly resented being named after the man.</p><p>Not only because his father was a muggle… but because he’d despised his own son.</p><p>The deep indentations of Tom’s sharply defined cheek muscles flexed in anger.</p><p>It wasn’t like he hadn’t given the man a chance.</p><p>He’d gone to Riddle House in search of his father one summer before school began. He was just sixteen.</p><p>Tom had been justifiably angry, and although he’d planned on killing his father that day, part of him hoped something might change his mind. He’d even hoped foolishly that perhaps Tom Riddle, Sr had been unaware of his birth. </p><p>Even despite his bitterness at being born half muggle, despite all of the jibes from his Slytherin friends and the pressures that came with that… Tom had really just wanted to <em> know </em> the man who sired him.</p><p>He wanted to know what parts of his own genetic makeup were attributed to the man.</p><p>Tom had lived his entire life without any sort of human connection or familial ties. So when he’d stood there in the drawing room of Riddle House, staring at the man who was an unmistakable mirror of himself… he hadn’t known exactly what to feel.</p><p>Tom had planned to say many things, but when faced with the flesh and blood man who’d never  been anything but a ghost to him, Tom had gone silent, frozen like an ice sculpture.</p><p>“Who are you, <em> boy </em>? And what are you doing here?”</p><p>He recalled that his father's face had been handsome, yet severe.</p><p>As Tom stood gazing at him in thick silence, the realization began to dawn upon his father's features.</p><p>His father took a step toward him, eyes narrowed. “Wait. I know who you are. You’re the spawn of that Gaunt whore that bewitched me. Filled with the devil, that one.” His father came to stand before him, with Tom’s grandparents looking on from behind him. His father gave him one scathing look, up and down his person. Tom looked so much like him, it was almost as if he were looking at himself. “I never could tell if she was possessed or just out of her mind. Should’ve been institutionalized, if you ask me.”</p><p>The look he gave Tom was one of bitter fury, though Tom hadn’t yet uttered a single word. “I suppose you’ve come here thinking you’re entitled to my name and fortune. I’ll tell you like I told her the day she came crying and begging me to take her back…” He pointed at Tom’s chest. “You’re not a Riddle and you never will be. I don’t care what you call yourself.” His father’s face twisted with hatred and scorn. “You are <em> not </em> my <em> son </em>.”</p><p>Tom remembered it like it was yesterday. </p><p>He blinked twice, then swallowed, his face blank, betraying nothing. Then he reached for his uncle’s wand and spoke calmly, “You’re right. I’m not.”</p><p>He looked directly into his father’s dark brown eyes. “I’m the heir of Slytherin.”</p><p>Tom had spent much of his time at Hogwarts pondering what it would feel like to cast the killing curse. He daydreamed about it constantly. He’d practiced his occlumency day and night because he’d always feared Dumbledore would somehow read his thoughts. </p><p>Tom had wondered what it would feel like to <em> mean </em> it… to desire someone’s death.</p><p>In that moment, when he’d stood surrounded by the opulent wealth of the father who despised him… he’d meant it.</p><p>With three succint flashes of green light, the bodies of Tom’s muggle relatives fell to the floor. He hadn’t hesitated. He’d coldly stepped over their bodies to cross the room, taking up the crystal decanter of wine his father had been holding, mid-pour, when he’d arrived.</p><p>Tom finished pouring the glass, then lifted it in a silent ‘cheers’ and took a sip.</p><p>He’d spent some time going through the house, learning what he could about the man, when he’d found his father’s fountain pen, the case of which was etched with his initials.</p><p>He’d pocketed it and gone back to his uncle’s shack to perform the necessary memory charms.</p><p>He’d hated his name ever since.</p><p>He’d even considered changing his name to Gaunt at one point.</p><p>But now, as he thought about Hermione bearing the name… he felt a strange sense of pride blooming in his chest.</p><p><em> Patience</em>, he told himself.</p><p>Patience was the critical key ingredient to all of his plans.</p><p>Tom walked to the corner of his bedroom and lifted his wand. He dragged it down through the empty air and a glowing laceration appeared, revealing a hidden pocket in the fabric of space. He reached into it and withdrew his journal, then ran his wand back over it, resealing the magical hiding place.</p><p>He cocked his jaw to the side as he flipped through the journal’s blank pages. He hadn’t held it since he moved into this flat years ago. </p><p>Tom had been contemplating something for a few days. He wanted to know if Hermione knew about his horcruxes, and also… he missed her. Perhaps if his journal fell into her hands, he’d have a solution for both.</p><p>But it wouldn’t need to be his horcrux… just a copy of it.</p><p>He went to his sitting room and plucked a couple of old books off his bookshelf. He could sacrifice these for the sake of love.</p><p>He duplicated them both into exact replicas of his journal. He swished and flourished his wand, flicking it several times as he perfected the transfiguration… tweaking each minor detail until they were nearly indistinguishable from each other.</p><p>Then he cast the same charm on them that he’d cast upon the parchments. It would cause the journals to act as a line of communication between him and Hermione. If Hermione already knew about his journal, and one of these happened to fall into her hands, perhaps she would write in it, thinking she was communicating with his horcrux.</p><p>It was a long shot, but he hoped that perhaps he would have a method of communicating with her, as well as extracting information.</p><p>When Tom finished with the charm, he spelled his copy to glow blue when activated. If he wasn’t paying attention, he could miss her message, and that simply wouldn’t do. </p><p>He took a deep breath as he looked at his work. Would she be angry if she knew he’d tricked her? Probably. But she was already angry with him, wasn’t she? </p><p>She’d also promised to tell him the truth, and he’d promised to wait until she was ready, but that promise was obviously of null effect now that she’d left, so he had to take matters into his own hands. </p><p>The truth was that he needed <em>some</em> <em>form</em> of interaction with Hermione. Otherwise, he’d go mad and probably murder someone.</p><p>He cocked a brow and tilted his head. He probably would do that anyway, to be fair.</p><p>Tuft’s time was ticking away.</p><p>Still, his intuition told him to keep her alive for a bit longer </p><p>He set the journals aside and returned his horcrux to its hiding place.</p><p>Then he vanished the protective runes around his bed, and went to sleep.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>The next morning, Tom had woken early, donned his black, pinstriped trousers, and was sitting shirtless at his dining table. He was reading about elemental magic and a rare kind of trace magic called a taboo, which he’d found in an old text in a junk shop of all places, in Knockturn Alley. He sipped his coffee slowly as he smoked a cigarette, when a loud knock sounded at the door of his flat. </p><p>Tom stood, his eyes narrowed as he made his way to the door and opened it. </p><p>There in the hallway stood Gaspard Dufresne and two other aurors, each holding up their Magical Law Enforcement badges.</p><p>“I assume you’re Mr. Riddle?”</p><p>Tom blinked, then gave a curt nod. “I am.”</p><p>“We have a warrant to search your residence.” Dufresne held up a scroll.</p><p>Tom took a drag from his cigarette, then stepped aside, allowing them to enter his flat.</p><p>He wondered if Hermione had betrayed some of his secrets to her employer. He had taken it into account that she might, and prepared accordingly.</p><p>Perhaps she was angrier than he thought.</p><p>He stood leaning against the wall, smoking his cigarette casually as he watched them search his cabinets. Then, he led them to his bedroom where they went through his chest of drawers and closet.</p><p>They cast detection charms, but there was nothing of value in his flat that could be revealed by a detection charm. Tom was much smarter than that.</p><p>His lips twitched as Dufresne’s eyes fell on the nightgown draped over the chair, then lingered on the knickers laying on the wood floor by the bed.</p><p>At length, his eyes met Tom’s.</p><p>Tom smirked. “I would’ve cleaned up if I had known I’d have company.”</p><p>Dufresne’s face didn’t budge. It remained stoic and glacial. He reached into his robes and withdrew a pen and pad.</p><p>“Where were you on the night that the Historical Society was robbed?”</p><p>Tom took a drag from his cigarette, then placidly blew the smoke into Dufresne’s face. The auror showed no change in expression. “I don’t know when that was. You’ll have to give me a date.”</p><p>“October 28th. Between ten p.m. and midnight.”</p><p>Tom appeared to be thinking. “I was at Malfoy Manor for the evening. Then back at my flat after.”</p><p>“When did you return to your flat?”</p><p>“Around two am.”</p><p>“And Mr. Malfoy can corroborate your story?”</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>”What were you doing at Malfoy Manor?”</p><p>Tom sucked in another drag, then expelled the smoke, before muttering, “Drinking… with old school buddies. Is that a crime?”</p><p>Gaspard cleared his throat. “Is there anyone who can vouch that you came back to your flat after?”</p><p>“Why does that matter if the robbery happened before midnight?”</p><p>“The timeline is very important. Just answer our questions and you won’t have any trouble.”</p><p>Tom’s brows furrowed, and he inhaled sharply. “There is someone. But I’d rather not say if I don’t have to.”</p><p>“And why is that?”</p><p>“Because it’s one of your aurors.”</p><p>Gaspard stared at Tom, blinking. Then he turned to his aurors and gestured for them to wait outside. As soon as they’d left, he turned back to Tom. “Is it Dumbledore?”</p><p>Tom’s eyes narrowed, then he hesitantly nodded, but he wondered how Dufresne came by that knowledge. “I don’t think it matters. She was asleep when I came in, so I doubt she can even corroborate.”</p><p>Gaspard’s eyes flicked up to Tom’s, then back down at the pad he wrote on, then over to the nightstand beside Tom’s bed. “Is that your wand?”</p><p>Tom followed the direction of his gaze, then he walked over to the side table, flicking the ash from his cigarette into the ashtray. “It is.”</p><p>“Do you mind if we search it?”</p><p>Tom’s eyes narrowed slightly. “Do you have a wand warrant?”</p><p>Gaspard’s jaw tensed, but that was the only change in his expression. </p><p>Tom’s lips twitched. “Those have to be granted by the Minister, do they not?”</p><p>Gaspard nodded. </p><p>Tom smiled politely. “I would be happy to turn it over, should you come back with a warrant.”</p><p>Gaspard ran his tongue over his top teeth, then reached into his robes, producing a photograph of the vanishing cabinet. He held it out for Tom to see. “Have you ever seen this cabinet before?”</p><p>Tom glanced at it, then cut his eyes at the auror. “It seems like my employer might have had one of those, but I don’t believe I’ve seen it recently. Perhaps he sold it.”</p><p>Gaspard watched him closely, gauging his reaction. “Are you aware of the magical properties of this item?”</p><p>Tom flicked his cigarette ash away. “I am. I’m required to know the magical properties of every item acquired by my employer. I’m a salesman.”</p><p>Gaspard stared at him, then gave a curt nod and turned to leave. “I believe that’s all we need.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Later that day, Gaspard sat at his desk, fuming. They had found nothing incriminating at Riddle’s apartment, and when they had visited Borgin and Burkes to question the owner, Riddle hadn’t been at work. The owner seemed to know very little about the location of the vanishing cabinet’s mate, stating that he had gifted it to the Historical Society because of its rarity, as a thanks for their continued partnership together. </p><p>He insisted the vanishing cabinet had been his idea, and said that his employee had no knowledge of the cabinet beyond its basic properties.</p><p>Burke had even submitted to legilimency, which confirmed his statements. </p><p>Gaspard slightly suspected Tom of being gifted with memory charms, but there was little he could do if he couldn’t search Riddle’s wand…</p><p>… and with Riddle and Tuft being so close, that warrant was highly unlikely to be granted.</p><p>Although the minister <em> had </em> asked him to follow Riddle; perhaps she didn’t trust him?</p><p>It was possible that Tuft might work with Dufresne if she thought she could find something to blackmail Riddle with, but Dufresne didn’t like to operate that way. It felt shady and underhanded, and too reminiscent of the rest of the Ministry world, a world which he greatly despised. He thought of Hermione’s words, how she’d said that the Ministry of the future was corrupt. </p><p>Dufresne didn’t want to contribute to that.</p><p>He took a deep breath, chewing his cheek as he contemplated.</p><p>His mind drifted to the sight of a nightgown in a chair in Riddle’s bedroom. </p><p>Hermione had told him she was no longer seeing Riddle. Either she’d lied, or the boy had moved on rather quickly. </p><p>Gaspard snorted. <em>Slytherin behavior at its best,</em> he thought.</p><p>However, the image sat in the back of his mind, despite his efforts to banish it. Something told him they were Hermione’s items.</p><p>He exhaled. “None of my concern,” he breathed. </p><p>He thought of Riddle. Gaspard had been around for quite a while. He’d worked for the DMLE for nearly twenty years now, and he’d been around numerous dark wizards, too many to count. His initial impression of Riddle when he’d seen the boy’s file was that of an altar boy. Perfect scores. Prefect. Head Boy. Even a commendation for services to the school, as if the lad were a hero.</p><p>But being in the wizard’s presence had been a different story altogether. The atmosphere of dark magic was thick around him, almost flowing off of him like kinetic energy.</p><p>He was sharp and intelligent, his eyes following the auror’s every move.</p><p>He unnerved Gaspard, and that was no easy feat. Dufresne had long ceased to be alarmed by criminals.</p><p>If Dufresne had little experience with dark wizards, then he might have found the boy innocent and charming. But he was well-trained and highly intuitive, and could sense something sinister lurking beneath the boy’s artfully maintained facade.</p><p>How had Hermione gotten wrapped up with someone like him? And why?</p><p><em> None of my business</em>, he told himself. </p><p>She was a grown woman, after all. </p><p>He couldn’t help his protective instinct from rearing its head, but he tamped down on the urge. </p><p>“None of my bloody business.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p><br/>“Dumbledore, you’re heavily reliant on your wand, which is dangerous if you happen to be disarmed. We are going to work on your hand-to-hand combat and wandless magic this week.” Dufresne looked her up and down. “Make sure you dress appropriately for battle training next week. Now, what weapons do you generally prefer to fight with? That is, <em> if </em> you fight with them.” </p><p>“I usually fight with a blade.”</p><p>He nodded. “Good. I require all of my aurors to carry at least one muggle weapon somewhere on their person when on duty. Should you be disarmed and in close range, many witches and wizards will be caught off guard by a physical assault, particularly with muggle weaponry, which gives you an advantage.” He eyed her again. “Where do you typically carry it?”</p><p>She gestured to her thigh. “I have a thigh sheath.”</p><p>He nodded, circling her. “Bring your blade of choice next week. I’ll train you myself on how to use it properly.” He held out his hand. “Now, give me your wand.”</p><p>She held it out and he took it. </p><p>He seemed to weigh it, then turned it over in his hands, examining its light color and intricate carving. “Vine wood?”</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>His brows lifted. “A rare wood. The druids highly favored vine wands… they are quite rare. They are reputed to be drawn to owners who seek a higher purpose.” He flicked his eyes to hers. “Those with hidden depths. Their owners often surprise the people who profess to know them best.”</p><p>Hermione averted her eyes. “You seem to know a lot about wand lore. I know a little bit. I took an elective class once.”</p><p>He cleared his throat. “When I went to Hogwarts, one of my Ravenclaw roommates was an exchange student from Japan. His father was a wandmaker from Takamatsu. He taught me a great deal about wandcraft.” He paused, then added, “His father was killed by one of Grindelwald’s acolytes.”</p><p>“Oh,” Hermione said with some distress. “How terrible.”</p><p>He snorted. “I killed the acolyte.” He cut his eyes toward Hermione. “My wand hand… slipped.”</p><p>Hermione rubbed her lips together and looked away. “So what is your wand made of?”</p><p>“Cedar.”</p><p>Her brows knit as she tried to remember what she had learned. She instantly reverted back to her studious, academic self as she began to recite the answer, as if she were reading from a textbook. “Let me see if I recall… <em> the owner of a cedar wand is said to be quite perceptive… great in strength of character and loyalty. They can be frightening adversaries and are </em> <b> <em>not</em> </b> <em> to be underestimated, particularly when protecting those whom they are fond of</em>.”</p><p>Gaspard’s lips turned up at the corners in a light smirk. “Very good. A textbook answer, but still, your memory is to be commended.”</p><p>Hermione bit her lip. “What do you know about… yew wands?”</p><p>He stopped short, then turned to look at her. His expression was suddenly guarded. “Yew wands… they never choose a mediocre or timid owner. Their affinity for the dark arts is well-known. They are particularly well-suited for dueling… and curses. However, on the opposite end of the spectrum, their owners can also be fierce protectors of others. Yew wands have a very polarizing reputation. It depends entirely upon the witch or wizard wielding them.”</p><p>Hermione swallowed. “Fascinating.”</p><p>His jaw tensed, and he tucked both wands into his robes. “Moving on. We are going to duel. <em> Wandlessly </em>. I want to see what you’re made of, Dumbledore. Then, we can go from there.” </p><p>They stood at opposite ends of the dueling hall of the auror department. Hermione was slightly nervous, because there was a stretch of enchanted glass which allowed a view from the other side, but did not reveal who was watching. That way, the senior aurors could watch the dueling practices and make training arrangements accordingly. </p><p>Hermione somehow had the feeling that the other aurors were watching from the other side.</p><p>“Don’t worry about the glass, Dumbledore. Pay attention to me.”</p><p>“I’m not worried about it,” she said defensively, lifting her chin a notch.</p><p>She thought she saw his lips turn up in amusement.</p><p>They bowed, and began to duel.</p><p>Gaspard’s dueling style surprised Hermione. Though he was just as powerful and effective as Hermione had guessed he would be, his style was quite different from Tom’s.</p><p>Tom was an aggressive duelist. His casting was deathly quick, much like the striking of a viper. He had a way of moving closer and closer while casting, so steadily that it was almost imperceptible, much like the slithering of a serpent until he had backed his opponent into a corner. Then, he struck a death blow, sinking his fangs in, so to speak.</p><p>Gaspard had a much more tactful and keen-minded approach. His strategy was subtle and less conspicuous. He watched Hermione with a perceptive eye, gauging the way that she dueled, analyzing her stance, her footwork, and method of casting. Whereas Tom would simply cast a barrage of quick, powerful spells intended to intimidate and throw his opponent off their axis, Gaspard spent the first few minutes shielding and casting decoy spells, while his real strategy was in observation. He looked for weakness, for chinks in his opponent’s armor. He consumed their fighting style and strategy as if it were data, and then, quickly and effectively formulated an attack strategy, as if he were a panther hidden in the darkness, stalking his prey.</p><p>Tom’s advantage was his speed and nerve. He could cast the most difficult spells with no effort at all, one after another in rapid succession. </p><p>Gaspard’s advantage was his intuition and uncanny ability to take in every aspect of his opponent’s attack.</p><p>However, he had sixteen years on Tom in terms of experience. </p><p>Hermione was woefully lacking in the area of wandless magic. She knew basic spells, but defensive and offensive spells were difficult, and took her more time without her wand. She hadn’t had much time to practice, truth be told, what with being on the run and trying to survive during the war. She knew only what she’d learned at Hogwarts, which wasn’t much, since Hogwarts didn’t focus heavily on wandless spells. Not to mention that she’d missed out on her seventh year.</p><p>“Definitely an area to practice,” he said as they finished their session. “I’ll assess your hand-to-hand combat skills next week, and then we’ll focus strongly on these areas.”</p><p>Hermione looked somewhat mortified. </p><p>“Dumbledore,” he interjected, breaking her out of her pity party. “If you didn’t have any weaknesses, I’d seriously wonder where you came from. You’re so strong with your wand that I don’t believe we need to focus our training on that. My objective is to keep you alive, so it’s my job to discover your weaknesses. You’re far more advanced than I was at your age, so there’s no need to be hard on yourself. That perfectionist trait is going to get you into trouble. I would know; I’m a perfectionist myself.”</p><p>She gave him a wry smile. “Thanks.”</p><p>Still, she couldn’t seem to break out of the cloud of self-denigration, and it must have shown in her face, because Gaspard stuck the tip of his wand beneath her chin and tilted her face upward, forcing her to stare into his icy blue eyes. “Snap out of it, trainee.”</p><p>“Sorry,” she said with a swallow. “I never got to finish my seventh year, and-”</p><p>“You were fighting in a war,” he interjected. “That’s more educational than any class. You have experience, and that is vital to success in this field. For that reason, you’ve skipped nearly every training course in my program and I’ve never had a new hire capable of doing that… so snap out of it before I start to think you lack humility.”</p><p>Hermione gave a small smile as he lowered his wand and handed hers back. His fingers brushed hers as she took it.</p><p>Hermione drew back sharply, shocked by the contact, but he didn’t notice as he quickly turned away and walked to the door.</p><p>“Go see McClaggen for your Auror Advantage class.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p>

</p><p> </p><p>Edward Rosier stared into nothingness. The sounds of glasses clinking and cutlery scraping only reached him as distant echoes. The only thing he was aware of was the persistent ache, a wound somewhere deep in the pit of his person which throbbed, both numb and sharply painful all at once. It felt like someone had run him clean through with a butter knife, puncturing all of his organs with a dull blade.</p><p>Nausea rose up into his throat. He choked it back down.</p><p>Muffled voices padded the silence of the room. He reached his hand into his pocket and touched silk. A pink ribbon. He rubbed it between his fingers. The texture was mildly reminiscent of the long, pale strands of Winifred’s hair.</p><p>“Isn’t that right, son?”</p><p>Edward Rosier’s eyes were glazed over, locked on a centerpiece composed of black dahlias, blood-tinged orchids, queen of the night tulips, and baccara roses.</p><p>“Edward?”</p><p>The younger Rosier finally roused, clearing his throat as he sat up in his chair. “Apologies, Father. What did you say?”</p><p>His father’s eyes pierced him, observing him knowingly. “Your aunt and I were discussing your sister. She and Cygnus Black have apparently struck up a courtship.”</p><p>“Oh,” he mumbled. “I’m not surprised.”</p><p>“What are your thoughts on young Cygnus, son?”</p><p>Edward suddenly felt the eyes of the room upon him. “I… I like Ciggy. Everyone does.”</p><p>“Nice chap,” said Rosier’s uncle. “My boy is in Slytherin with him as well.”</p><p>“I for one, am happy I won’t have to play matchmaker,” said his mother. “I do hope they get on well together. I suppose we shall have him over for dinner once Hogwarts lets out for the summer.”</p><p>“Druella is such a beauty. A very accomplished witch, for one so young. You should be very proud of her,” said his aunt. “Would that I had been given a girl, but only a boy, and then sadly, no more children… But not for lack of trying, mind you.”</p><p>Edward’s eyebrows furrowed at his aunt’s remark. He’d been thinking quite a bit on some things Tom had said recently. They seemed to be almost unmentionable, the things Tom had said about infertility in pureblood families. But now that Tom had brought it to his attention, Rosier began to notice more and more.</p><p>He swallowed, feeling an unfamiliar fear overtaking his emotions.</p><p>Fear that everything he had grown up believing had been a lie.</p><p>“Of course, Cygnus is a Black. Good magical blood, but unfortunately the brother of Walburga Black. That one is garnering <em> quite </em> the reputation for being a trouble-making witch. Let’s hope her new husband can get her under control,” said his father with an air of distaste.</p><p>“Father,” murmured Edward. “I just realized there’s something I need to do. May I be excused?”</p><p>The older Rosier gazed at him for a moment, searching his countenance, as if attempting to read his son’s motivations. Then, he looked away and gave a sharp nod. “You may.”</p><p>Edward stood, unfolding his napkin from his lap and dabbing his lips, before laying it on the table with a muttered, “Excuse me,” to his aunt and uncle. </p><p>He retreated to his bedroom, where he leaned back against the door and stared blankly at the ceiling. His hand was still resting in his pocket, and when he withdrew it, the pink silk ribbon was wound tightly around his finger. He looked down at it, rubbing its texture between his thumb and index finger.</p><p>Then, he pushed off from the door, turned on his heel, and apparated away.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Winifred Haywood lived with her parents in a large stone cottage in the countryside of East Anglia. Her parents were well-known potioneers, and Winifred had inherited the affinity. Her father was a half-blood and her mother was a muggleborn witch, and Winifred had often been praised by Slughorn for her success in Potions class, but her family hadn’t been considered influential enough to warrant an invitation into the Slug Club. </p><p>Her parents had been the original potion developers for Fleamont Potter, helping him formulate his infamous Sleakeazy’s hair potion, which eventually made him filthy rich. The family had lived off of their cut for many years.</p><p>Winifred had just come in from the garden with fresh ingredients. The sun was just beginning to set, but she was determined not to quit for the evening until she got this particular brew right. She’d been trying new formula variations for a clotting potion (a brew to instantly stem bleeding). Her hands and apron were a bit dirty and her fine, silvery hair was mussed. </p><p>She was carefully measuring out the powdered unicorn horn when a knock came at the door. Winnie signed and set her ingredients aside, wiping her hands on her apron as she went to answer the door.</p><p>Her face instantly fell, shock registering as her heart jumped into her throat.</p><p>She swallowed hard. “What do you want?”</p><p>Edward Rosier stood there in all his glory, his fine physique garbed in expensively tailored clothes, sharply contrasted with her messy appearance. Her eyes roved his brown curls and chocolate brown eyes, framed by long lashes. He always had a boyish smirk on his face which lent him a mischievous quality. </p><p>That smirk was absent, replaced by a scowl.</p><p>He narrowed his eyes at her suspiciously, giving her a lengthy appraisal as if he hadn’t just shown up on <em> her </em> doorstep uninvited.</p><p>Then he ran his tongue over his teeth and sniffed nonchalantly. “What do you think I want, Haywood?”</p><p>Her lips parted, eyes narrowing in disbelief. “You cannot be serious…”</p><p>Again, he glanced over her, taking in her slim frame obscured by a linen apron, then his dark eyes slid over her pale face, with its Scandinavian features and cheeks pink from the winter air, the flaxen hair framed by wispy flyaways. </p><p>“Edward, my parents are here-“</p><p>Before she had a chance to finish, he reached for her hand and jerked her through the door frame. Then, in a flash, he had apparated them both.</p><p>She suddenly smelled apples, and before she’d even regained her footing, she felt herself being shoved up against the bark of a tree.</p><p>The apple orchard. They’d always met here before he coldly severed their relationship.</p><p>There were no apples, only bare branches, but the smell always lingered here.</p><p>He pressed his body tightly against hers as his lips captured her mouth.</p><p>For a moment, Winnie’s heart stopped. She let out a choked sound, not a moan or a plea, but a sound laced with sadness.</p><p>He pressed his tongue roughly against hers, the violence of his emotions tangible through the brutality of his touch. He began to lift her dress, but she broke the kiss, shoving her fists against him with force. </p><p>Ripping herself out of his grasp, she exclaimed, “What are you <em>doing</em>?”</p><p>The corner of his mouth lifted in a caustic smirk and he laughed bitterly. “Thought you might be down for a shag.”</p><p>She stared at him angrily, her mouth slightly ajar. Then, she snapped it shut. “Why are you doing this to me?”</p><p>He rolled his eyes with a scowl, his jaw muscles tight and flexing. “I don’t know what you’re fucking talking about, Win.”</p><p>Her chest heaved as she grew angrier. “You won’t let yourself be happy, so you have to make me unhappy too, is that it? Why can’t you just leave me alone?”</p><p>He appeared to laugh, though his smile held no humor. He refused to look at her. “Forget it. If you don’t want to fuck, then we might as well leave.”</p><p>“<em> You </em> brought <em> me </em> here… you utter <em> clown </em> .” She walked up to him until she was standing chest to stomach, her smaller frame dwarfed by his height, but it made no difference. Her eyes blazed with fury. “I don’t know what will happen to you, Edward. I’m not good enough for you? That’s alright, because I’ll find someone. Someone who will treat me with respect, who doesn’t care about the shallow things that seem to matter so much to you and your aristocratic family. Then <em> I’ll </em> be happy. But you? You’ll live with this like poison in your heart for the rest of your life. I don’t think you’ll ever be happy.”</p><p>He glared at her with unbridled hatred. “I wish I could kill you, witch, for what you’ve done to me.”</p><p>Her eyes widened. “What <em> I’ve </em> done to <em> you </em>? You broke my heart!”</p><p>“I don’t want to hear your pathetic lies.” </p><p>An instant later, he’d apparated away. </p><p>Winnie stood gazing at the spot where he’d just stood, tears pooling in her eyes that finally spilled over in rivulets down her face. </p><p>She sat at the base of the apple tree, letting her head fall onto her knees, and she sobbed her misery until the stars appeared in the night, shivering like cold spectators in the winter sky.</p><p> </p><hr/><p><br/>
Hermione laid on her maroon velvet couch with her head in Eulessia Baron’s lap. Around the room sat her friends, Cedrella Weasley, Piksy, and Lucky. They’d all been out for a girl’s night to celebrate the publishing of Hermione’s spellbook. She’d just gotten the proof copy from Obscurus Books, and when they got back to her flat, they’d popped open a bottle of sparkling champagne and passed it around, tapping their wands and searching various spells. <br/>

</p><p>The group knew about her breakup with Tom. Eulessia ran her fingers through Hermione’s hair comfortingly.</p><p>Cedrella held up her glass. “To auror Hermione, and to Hermione Dumbledore’s Compendious Searchable Spellbook!”</p><p>Piksy and Lucky giggled and they all generously imbibed from their drinks.</p><p>“You know,” Eulessia said in her warm, low voice. “Gaspard Dufresne is quite handsome… and he’s single.”</p><p>Hermione swallowed. “He’s also my boss.”</p><p>Eulessia chuckled. “Which makes him even more sexy, don’t you agree?”</p><p>“Oh, stop it, seriously,” Hermione muttered, her cheeks reddening.</p><p>“I mean, who doesn’t want an older man who’s off limits? If you don’t want him, I’ll take him.”</p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes. “I’ll be sure to introduce you.”</p><p>Eulessia’s cool fingers stroked her frizzy curls. “But seriously… Do you think he might be interested in you? The papers would have a field day. They’re already matching the two of you up… Calling you a power couple… saying you’re in the running for the next Minister.”</p><p>Hermione’s eyebrows rose sharply. “I can’t believe they would say such a thing. I’d be the youngest Minister in history… No one would vote for me… and… I don’t know. I don’t think Gaspard is interested in me.” She took a deep breath. “I mean, I do find him handsome. He’s rather intimidating, though.”</p><p>“More intimidating than Tom?”</p><p>“Well, no. It’s just… I suppose Tom was closer to my age. Gaspard, he’s got nearly twenty years of experience fighting dark wizards. He’s almost… <em>too</em> <em>much</em> man for me, if that makes sense.”</p><p>Eulessia and Cedrella burst out laughing. </p><p>“Hermione, you are absolutely ridiculous.”</p><p>“Can’t relate.”</p><p>“Too much man? No such thing.”</p><p>“No, it doesn’t make one jot of sense.”</p><p>Hermione laughed with them, but inside, she was wondering if they were right. Was Gaspard the better choice? The smarter choice? </p><p>The issue was… Hermione didn’t think she could ever get Tom Riddle fully purged from her heart.</p><p>She decided to change the subject.</p><p>“How are things at the <em> Prophet </em> now? I do miss it sometimes. I love writing.”</p><p>Eulessia sighed. “It’s not the same. Not at all. Of course, it’s not nearly as fun now that you’ve left, but every blasted thing I write now has to go through <em> her </em> . She changes <em> everything </em>. I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but anything they publish about you has a negative spin now. Everything is geared toward mollifying the old families. I don’t even get to write features anymore… they’ve moved me to Quidditch and horoscopes, neither of which are my expertise, but there’s nothing I can do about it.”</p><p>“That’s quite unfortunate. Have you thought about leaving?”</p><p>She shrugged. “Where would I go?”</p><p>“It’s too bad Hermione couldn’t start her own bloody paper,” Cedrella chimed in. </p><p>Eulessia laughed and said, “Now <em> that’s </em> a paper I’d want to work for!”</p><p>Hermione blinked. “Well, why couldn’t I?”</p><p>Piksy and Lucky screeched, and Cedrella and Eulessia sat their glasses down. “Would you really think of that?”</p><p>“I suppose I could try. Although I don’t know the first thing about owning my <em> own </em> paper,” Hermione mused. “And I’m awfully busy at the DMLE now. I’d have to have someone run it for me.”</p><p>“I’ve been with the <em> Prophet </em> for ten years now,” said Eulessia. “I know almost all there is to know about that paper.”</p><p>“Septimus has been complaining about his job at the Ministry lately,” Cedrella hedged with a wink. “He might be looking for another job soon.”</p><p>Hermione laughed. “You guys are giving me <em> lots </em> to think about… as if I don’t already have enough on my plate.”</p><p>“Piksy will help,” the little elf piped up. </p><p>Hermione’s mind was already racing. </p><p>“Columnist, author, auror, newspaper connoisseur… next stop, Minister for Magic,” Cedrella grinned.</p><p>“Her ambition knows no bounds,” chuckled Eulessia. “Are you sure you’re a Gryffindor, Hermione? You’d fit into Slytherin quite well.”</p><p>Hermione rubbed her forearm absentmindedly and gave a tight smile. “Perhaps.”</p>

<h2 class="heading">Disillusionment</h2>
</div>

<div class="userstuff">
<p dir="ltr">Hermione shivered without meaning to. Gaspard stood behind her, his chest at her back as he showed her the proper methods of wielding a blade. McLaggen stood in front of her, advancing toward her in various attack positions, and she held her goblin-forged blades in both hands, with Gaspard’s fingers wrapped around her wrists. He manipulated her wrists like a puppet’s, jabbing the knife toward McLaggen, bringing it up and slicing at his throat. </p><p dir="ltr">Hermione swallowed, keeping her attention on the knife moves. Then, Gaspard stood back and watched as she and McLaggen sparred. She mimicked his movements perfectly.</p><p dir="ltr">“Whew!” said McLaggen. “If I had moved an inch to the left she’d have had me with that thing.”</p><p dir="ltr">Gaspard smiled, a rare occurrence, and he nodded his approval. “It’s obvious you’ve fought with a blade before.”</p><p dir="ltr">Hermione caught her breath for a moment. “Yes. Some.” She darent say more about the war with Jack McLaggen present.</p><p dir="ltr">“Let me show you something else.” He came near again and Hermione’s blood beat through her veins swiftly. She didn’t quite understand the reaction of her body. She wasn’t exactly crushing on Gaspard, but with all of the things her friends had put into her head recently, she had a sudden acute awareness of his overwhelming masculinity. </p><p dir="ltr">She’d heard nothing all weekend from Cedrella and Eulessia about his good looks, his brilliant marks in school (“he’s a Ravenclaw, of course they were!”) and (“but he had more outstanding NEWTs than any other seventh years!”) as well as his accomplishments in the DMLE and his brusque behavior.</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>“He’s quite hard to read,” Hermione had said. “I can’t imagine anyone being able to get under that stony exterior.”</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>“You know the more prickly they are, the better they are in bed, right?” said Eulessia, giving her a twinkling side eye.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>Hermione didn’t have much experience in that department, but she would still have to agree.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>“I can’t really think of him that way,” she muttered. “All he does is order people around all day.”</em>
</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Eulessia’s eyes rolled back in her head</em>. <em>“Could you be more thickheaded? Imagine him ordering you around like that… in the bedroom.”</em></p><p dir="ltr">
<em>Hermione swallowed, and suddenly she had a vision of those ghostly blue eyes staring down at her while she knelt below him. </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>“Stop it, Lessi! Now you’re putting nasty things in my head!”</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>“Perfect! So now you can think about him that way,” Eulessia giggled.</em>
</p><p>Hermione found it difficult to breathe when she did her training days with Gaspard, mainly because they’d put so many things in her blooming head about him and he was just far too close for comfort some days… especially during combat training.</p><p dir="ltr">Still, when night fell and she was alone, her thoughts wandered to Riddle, and her body ached with a fulfillment that never came.</p><p dir="ltr">“I love you,” she whispered each night, before she drifted off in pure exhaustion.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><hr/><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Gaspard had Hermione in a headlock. </p><p dir="ltr">The witch twisted and bucked in his hold, but couldn’t break it. </p><p dir="ltr">“Remember the maneuver, Dumbledore. You can do this.”</p><p dir="ltr">Jack McLaggen sat nearby observing, eating a treacle tart.</p><p dir="ltr">Hermione issued a struggling sound, causing Gaspard to hold his breath. </p><p dir="ltr"><em>Fuck</em>, he thought. <em>Don’t do that, trainee</em>.</p><p dir="ltr">It was bad enough that he had to be so close to her three days a week.</p><p dir="ltr">“If I was <em>actually</em> trying to choke you,” he muttered. “You’d be unconscious by now.”</p><p dir="ltr">Combat training was every Wednesday, only one day a week, but that was one day too many as far as Gaspard was concerned.</p><p dir="ltr">It was unfortunate that he had to show her these tactical positions and combat maneuvers, which required physical proximity.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, he’d trained many of his recruits in the same manner… but none of them had been Hermione Dumbledore.</p><p dir="ltr">Her smell was just too potent, and her body too soft. Gaspard swallowed and kept his hold on her. “Today would be nice, trainee. I have other things to do and more important places to be.”</p><p dir="ltr">Again, she tried to shift her weight so that she could break his hold with her hands by threading them beneath his forearms. She bucked her hips and they ground against his as she tried to gain leverage. Then, she let out another sound, a mixture between a grunt, a gasp, and a moan.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Nope</em>, he thought as heat flooded his body and his blood gushed in his veins.</p><p dir="ltr">He quickly disengaged, releasing her. “That’s enough for today,” he muttered as he turned and stalked away. “We’ll try it again tomorrow.”</p><p dir="ltr">She sat up, trying to catch her breath as she gazed after him. Her eyes darted to McLaggen. “What’s his problem?”</p><p dir="ltr">McLaggen shrugged innocently, giving her a smirk as he chuckled to himself and walked away.</p><p> </p><hr/><p dir="ltr"><br/>
Gaspard sat in his office, pinching the bridge of his nose between his fingers as he waited for his body to calm down. His tactic of thinking about other things while they wrestled had clearly not worked.</p><p dir="ltr">His erections were becoming more and more painful each time, and he was 99% positive that if blue balls was a terminal illness, he’d have long been dead and buried.</p><p dir="ltr">He couldn’t fix the problem himself, because anytime he tried to relieve himself by jerking one off, he couldn’t stop his thoughts from drifting to Hermione. </p><p dir="ltr">He either needed a witch to fuck, free of obligations (he’d already come to the conclusion that did not exist)… or he needed to blow off some steam. He’d long given up on drinking with his fellow aurors. Gaspard didn’t particularly like people. He liked work, and he liked training, and dueling, and he liked raids, and making arrests.</p><p dir="ltr">Those things made him feel alive.</p><p dir="ltr">He hadn’t made an arrest in quite some time. He’d been too bogged down with the responsibilities as the Head of the Department to make it out onto the field. Bones was quite capable of handling the smaller cases and investigations. </p><p dir="ltr">Gaspard missed being an auror sometimes. He wasn’t particularly fond of tracking down evidence and filling out paperwork, nor testifying in the Wizengamot, nor forming committees.</p><p dir="ltr">Gaspard flipped open a file on his desk and narrowed his eyes. As he read the case, he decided it would be a perfect opportunity to get Hermione out onto the field. </p><p dir="ltr">He used his wand to page his assistant. “Send Dumbledore in.”</p><p dir="ltr">A few minutes later, Hermione entered his office.</p><p dir="ltr">“Here. Take this file.” He handed the file to her and she took it. “Read it. I’m going to take you with me when we conduct the raid. I’ll probably bring another auror or two as well.” He flicked his eyes to her. “This is just for your observation. You won’t be involved in any of the action. I’ll have an auror assigned to you. Once you’ve seen how these things go, perhaps you’ll be ready to team up on some of the smaller raids, like this one.”</p><p>“Of course. I can’t wait.”</p><p dir="ltr">Gaspard nodded. “See you tomorrow, trainee.”</p><p dir="ltr">She gave him a small smile and ducked her head. “Have a good evening, Mr. Dufresne.” </p><p dir="ltr">She started to leave, but then stopped and turned around. “Um… did I do something wrong earlier? During training? You left rather abruptly.”</p><p dir="ltr">Gaspard’s eyebrows lifted in surprise, but his eyes were guarded as usual. “No, Dumbledore. You didn’t do anything wrong.”</p><p dir="ltr">Hermione stood for a moment, as if waiting for further explanation, but when he gave none, she lowered her eyes. “Good. See you tomorrow, sir.”</p><p dir="ltr">She turned and left, closing the door behind her. </p><p dir="ltr">Gaspard leaned back in his chair and laid his head against the back of it, exhaling sharply. </p><p dir="ltr">He thought to himself that he had the worst luck with witches.</p><p>His wife had passed away, and after nearly twenty years alone, the only witch who’d managed to catch his attention was bloody eighteen years younger than him, and was unfortunately in love with another wizard.</p><p dir="ltr">Gaspard desperately needed a drink.</p><p> </p><hr/><p dir="ltr"><br/>
Tom was at work, but while he worked, he was pondering his soulmate.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, he was as focused as he had always been on the tasks at hand: learning new spells, growing in his magical skills, balancing his political obligations, managing his death eaters… but in the back of his mind, Hermione was his ever-present obsession, the focus of every other thought. </p><p dir="ltr">Blood curses. <em>Hermione</em>. Malfoy. <em>Hermione</em>. Tuft. <em>Hermione</em>. Rune patterns. <em>Hermione</em>. </p><p dir="ltr">She was his soulmate, and he wouldn’t let her go. Not only because he loved her… not only because every fiber of his being desired her, but because when the soul bond was complete, their magic would be unified and the power that resulted from that bond would be astronomical. </p><p dir="ltr">According to the book on soul theory… they would be invincible together.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Invictus</em>.</p><p dir="ltr">The potential contained in their soul bond gave new meaning to the word for Tom.</p><p dir="ltr">That was too delicious of a possibility to give up. </p><p dir="ltr">They were already a nearly unstoppable duo… but if bonded for eternity? If their magical cores were amplified by the bond?</p><p dir="ltr">Tom grinned to himself as he finished polishing the amulet of Anubis and placed it in its case.</p><p dir="ltr">Tom knew that he could break their silence and close the distance between them.</p><p dir="ltr">Truth be told, she’d never been able to resist him, no matter how angry or afraid of him she was.</p><p dir="ltr">She was his soulmate, after all. His twin flame. He knew precisely what her buttons were and how to push them.</p><p dir="ltr">Then once she gave in… did she ever know how to push his as well.</p><p dir="ltr">The image returned to his mind of Hermione laying in her bed in the moonlight, legs spread, her fingers toying with herself… the wet sounds that her pussy made as she drove her fingers into herself, the soft, hoarse moans falling from her lips… his name rolling off her tongue.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Mine</em>.</p><p dir="ltr">She was <em>his</em> soulmate.</p><p dir="ltr">A wave of ownership washed over Tom. </p><p dir="ltr"><em>She left you,</em> said his inner voice.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>She’s not running from me, </em>he told himself<em>. She’s running from herself.</em></p><p dir="ltr">
<em>She’s afraid of what she will become when she gives herself over to me.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>She’s terrified of what I will draw out of her, what is buried deep inside her.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">When Tom really stood back and analyzed the changes he’d made over the past year, he found that he didn’t mourn a thing.</p><p dir="ltr">He didn’t grieve his basilisk. He didn’t grieve his ideologies. </p><p dir="ltr">He would only grieve if Hermione was gone forever. If she somehow traveled back to her time and he lost her.</p><p dir="ltr">Then, he would allow himself to grieve.</p><p dir="ltr">But only after he did everything in his power to uncover whatever time magic she’d used, and went after her.</p><p dir="ltr">He would track her down through time and space if he had to.</p><p dir="ltr">“You’re not safe, little witch,” he muttered. </p><p dir="ltr">She might run, but she could never resist. He’d make sure of it.</p><p dir="ltr">When the time was right, Tom decided it was time to reveal his secret.</p><p dir="ltr">She needed to know that he was her soulmate.</p><p dir="ltr">Who could deny the powerful magic of a soul bond? It was irrefutable.</p><p dir="ltr">Tom sold a pair of enchanted spectacles to a customer. They allowed one to see through disillusionment charms and concealment spells.</p><p dir="ltr">As the customer left, Tom imagined Hermione naked. He had her physique memorized, and he raked over her body within his mind’s eye, dotingly admiring every detail. She was thin and petite, but to Tom she was shaped perfectly. Every part of her turned him on, from her smell, to her frizzy hair and slender neck, even down to her dainty feet. Her breasts were small but perky and perfectly round, and Tom’s mouth began to water thinking about her soft pink nipples hardening under his tongue. Her ass was curvy and tight and her skin… fuck, her skin was a warm golden color and supple, full of life and often flushed with passion. </p><p dir="ltr">He’d fixated on her ass quite often of late, and he wondered what it would feel like to slide his cock inside her.</p><p dir="ltr">It wasn’t so much that he cared about taking her that way. The sensation wasn’t that much different, he imagined, although he wanted to find out. He’d never even thought of doing it with Walburga. The idea had always repulsed him. It wasn’t usually a fixation of his, but with Hermione, it had become an obsession of late because he wanted to claim every single part of her. Tom relished making her come and giving her pleasure in new and exciting ways that she’d never experienced. He wanted to hear the sound she would make and watch her face when he filled her ass. He wanted to whisper things in her ear and watch her eyes glaze over with lust as she submitted to his every desire. He loved when she was feisty, but he loved even more when she was submissive… when she gave herself over to him willingly, nothing but pure trust in her warm brown eyes. He wanted to make her moan, to be the one who caused her to be racked with pleasure. He thought of fingering her wet pussy while he fucked her ass, feeling her walls throb around his fingers as she came over and over again. He’d go slow, and he wouldn’t let himself come until he’d rung every last moan from her pretty lips. </p><p dir="ltr">Tom’s eyes fell shut as he exhaled. </p><p dir="ltr">“Fuck, witch,” he breathed. </p><p dir="ltr">He’d had her again and again, for months and months, but still it seemed that he could not get enough of Hermione Dumbledore. His vivid imagination was running rampant.</p><p dir="ltr">Tom swallowed, running his fingers through his hair as he reached down and adjusted himself.</p><p dir="ltr">He was feening like a potion addict for her.</p><p dir="ltr">He laid his hands flat on the desk and leaned over, counting arithmancy sums in his head until his breathing had regulated.</p><p dir="ltr">He needed her like he needed oxygen.</p><p dir="ltr">She was in his very veins.</p><p dir="ltr">Even his magic was suffering since she’d left. He felt a deep ache in his soul, as if a part of it had been perforated and ripped away.</p><p dir="ltr">He needed her back.</p><p dir="ltr">He needed the thread of life, so that he could perform the soul bond and bind their magic and their souls forever.</p><p dir="ltr">He hoped Malfoy was successful in delivering the diary to Hermione.</p><p dir="ltr">Tom coveted her words, and her thoughts. </p><p dir="ltr">She was consuming him.</p><p dir="ltr">Whereas before, all he could see was his ambition… power…</p><p dir="ltr">Now he only saw Hermione. He couldn’t stomach the thought of having power without her.</p><p dir="ltr">He woke every morning, feeling her absence acutely. He craved her skin beneath his fingertips. It was a driving, incessant need throughout the day. Was it the soulmate connection which drove him to imagine being buried inside her every moment of every hour?</p><p dir="ltr">Tom clenched his teeth. The need for her was maddening. He couldn’t stand the thought that she was lying alone each night, pleasuring herself to thoughts of him.</p><p dir="ltr">He would’ve thought that knowledge would relieve him, but it only served to frustrate him more. </p><p dir="ltr">He decided that once she gave up this futile attempt to make a point, he would set a rule that she could only perform that act with his permission.</p><p dir="ltr">Tom took sex very seriously, after all. </p><p dir="ltr">He never had in the past with other witches, but with Hermione, he felt differently.</p><p dir="ltr">He recalled a conversation between them just before the Paris trip, following a particularly intense bout of lovemaking.</p><p dir="ltr">“<em>Physical touch is definitely your love language, Tom.”</em></p><p dir="ltr">
<em>He cocked a brow. “My what?”</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>She giggled. “Your love language. It’s a theory formed by muggle psychiatrists.”</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>His brows knitted. “Go on.”</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>“Well, supposedly, every person has their own language with which they express affection, and also how they prefer to receive affection. Yours would definitely be physical touch.”</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>His eyes narrowed. “How fascinating… and what are these supposed languages?”</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>Hermione had fought back a smile. “Well, there’s physical touch… words of affirmation…. Acts of service… giving gifts… and quality time.”</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>“Interesting.”</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>“Mhm.”</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>“Then yours, my dear witch, would certainly be words of affirmation. I’ve never known a witch to react more strongly to verbal validation and praise than you.”</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>He’d smirked as her face turned bright red. </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>She cleared her throat. “Ahem… it’s odd because I never would have pegged you as that, personally. Before we met, that is.”</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>He gave her a muted smile. “Only with you, darling. With everyone else, I suppose it’s acts of service. Serve me… and I won’t kill you.”</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>Hermione laughed and threw her hand over her face. “Oh god, Tom, you really are a lost cause.”</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">Tom found himself smiling at the memory. </p><p dir="ltr">His smile quickly fell as he remembered the line of work she’d now chosen. </p><p dir="ltr">To be an auror was an extremely dangerous line of work. If anything happened to her, he would never forgive himself. </p><p dir="ltr">But then again, he couldn’t force her out of the position. She’d only hate him again, and he wanted her back.</p><p dir="ltr">It went against everything that Tom had ever learned. Every fiber of his being screamed to control; his compulsions had become maddeningly impossible to ignore. How to tamp down on those urges? He’d never found a way. </p><p dir="ltr">If Malfoy got the journal to her, he’d have a way to speak with her without her awareness.</p><p dir="ltr">Now he simply needed to find a way to protect her without controlling her. </p><p dir="ltr">He thought of the ring given to her by Dumbledore. It was enchanted, and he had a feeling Dumbledore knew what enchantments were placed on it. </p><p dir="ltr">If it had a protective enchantment placed on it, then at least Tom would have some peace of mind.</p><p dir="ltr">Perhaps he could find a way to place a tracking spell on her…</p><p dir="ltr">Tom knew his mind was acting up again, casting him into a hysteria that usually led to deranged actions on his part.</p><p dir="ltr">He checked his pocket watch: the golden one Hermione had given him for Christmas. </p><p dir="ltr">He began to close up shop and turned the sign from open to closed. Then, he said goodbye to his employer and apparated to Hogsmeade.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><hr/><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Dumbledore handed Dufresne a glass of sherry. His young friend took a sip, then wrinkled his nose. “Have you got something stronger?”</p><p dir="ltr">Dumbledore chuckled, then waved his hand and the glass instantly filled with firewhiskey. “You young bucks have no taste for the more refined spirits. You prefer the ones that taste like tar.”</p><p dir="ltr">Gaspard laughed in his deep tenor. “It’s to match our black hearts.”</p><p dir="ltr">Dumbledore sighed. “Would you care to smoke a pipe of Veela leaves, my friend?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Why not.”</p><p dir="ltr">Dumbledore crossed his office and flicked his wand, opening a drawer in a large cabinet on one side of the room. As he sought out a set of pipes from his collection, a knock came at the door.</p><p dir="ltr">Gaspard flicked his gaze to the door, lifting his eyebrows. “Should I go?”</p><p dir="ltr">“No, no,” said Dumbledore, crossing back to the corner where Gaspard sat in an armchair by the window. “It’s likely just Merrythought or Crouch, come to torment me about something I’d rather not be bothered with.” He waved his wand, casting a Disillusionment charm. Gaspard disappeared, blending into the background. “There. Shouldn’t take more than a minute or two,”</p><p dir="ltr">Dumbledore waved his hand and the door opened. He placed the pipes down on his desk and turned to see Tom Riddle entering his office.</p><p dir="ltr">“Oh, hello, there, Tom,” Dumbledore said with sharp surprise. “You’re the last person I thought to be walking into my office this evening.”</p><p dir="ltr">“I can imagine.”</p><p dir="ltr">Dumbledore gave him a tight smile. “What can I do for you, lad?”</p><p dir="ltr">Tom’s eyebrows drew forward slightly at being called by that word, but his eyes caught on the pair of phoenixes perched beside Dumbledore’s desk.</p><p dir="ltr">“Is that… Hermione’s phoenix?”</p><p dir="ltr">Dumbledore followed his line of sight. “Ah, yes. Seraphina is her name. Beautiful creature. Fawkes, as you can imagine, is quite thrilled to have a companion.”</p><p dir="ltr">Riddle nodded, gazing at the bird in silence. Dumbledore stood quietly as he waited for Tom to broach the reason for his visit.</p><p dir="ltr">He eyed Tom, noticing the slight difference in his appearance since he’d graduated from Hogwarts. Of course, he was a few years older, but that’s not what had transformed him. Many people wouldn’t have noticed the change, but Dumbledore knew the effects of dark magic more than most. He’d watched the same transformation in Gellert Grindelwald. </p><p dir="ltr">Finally, Tom turned to face him. “Do you recall giving Hermione a ring for her birthday?”</p><p dir="ltr">Dumbledore gazed at him for a few moments. “Certainly. How could I forget?”</p><p dir="ltr">Tom swallowed, obviously uncomfortable with whatever he was about to ask. “The ring is enchanted, is it not?”</p><p dir="ltr">Albus cocked his head, his eyes narrowing slightly behind his spectacles. “Why do you ask?”</p><p dir="ltr">Tom’s jaw tensed. “I could feel the enchantment on it when she was wearing it. It’s old magic… woven around it like a braid.”</p><p dir="ltr">Dumbledore examined Tom for a moment, then nodded. “It is a family heirloom. It has been passed down for centuries.”</p><p dir="ltr">“So she said.” Tom glanced around the room, but did not manage to see Dufresne under the disillusionment spell. “So you are not familiar with the magic upon the ring?”</p><p dir="ltr">“I didn’t say that. Why are you asking, Tom?”</p><p dir="ltr">“I need to know if it’s the Ring of Dispel.”</p><p dir="ltr">Dumbledore’s blue eyes sharpened. “How do you know about that?”</p><p dir="ltr">“I work for a dealer of magical artifacts. I know a great deal about enchanted items… particularly ones so old, but I’ve never seen a ring like that. There are only a few such enchanted rings, and only one inlaid with pearls. The ring given to Lancelot by the Lady of the Lake.”</p><p dir="ltr">Dumbledore eyed him like a hawk. “Why do you want to know? If it is such an item, then that is between myself and my daughter.”</p><p dir="ltr">“I need to know that she’s protected, Headmaster.” He exhaled sharply through his nose. “She’s taken this… auror position.”</p><p dir="ltr">Dumbledore blinked several times. “She is well-trained, Tom, as you know.”</p><p dir="ltr">Tom ran his tongue over his top teeth and lifted his jaw slightly. He reminded Dumbledore of a snake coiled and agitated, moments from striking out. He could only imagine that the absence of his daughter in his life had driven Tom to these lengths.</p><p dir="ltr">Every encounter that Albus had with Tom over the years, he was always the same. Cool and aloof. Emotionless, his actions and words carefully measured. If he showed any expression at all, it was always that winning smile, a charming facade he’d crafted distinctly in his younger years.</p><p dir="ltr">In truth, Dumbledore had never seen Tom look so frantic. He seemed almost panicked. </p><p dir="ltr">“You don’t have to tell me where the ring came from, or what spells are upon it. Just tell me that it will protect her if it comes to that.”</p><p dir="ltr">Dumbledore crossed his arms and leaned back against his desk, studying Tom. “The ring is woven with complex protective enchantments, yes.”</p><p dir="ltr">Tom averted his eyes and then nodded. He looked at the floor, deep in thought. Then he lifted his hand and ran his fingers through his hair, disturbing his black curls. “Thank you, sir.”</p><p dir="ltr">Without another word or so much as a backward glance, he strode back out through the door of the office, slamming it loudly behind him.</p><p dir="ltr">Dumbledore gazed after him, thinking to himself that Riddle was a man in love, if he’d ever seen one…</p><p dir="ltr">… and Dumbledore had seen many.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Love</em>. Something he’d never thought possible of Tom.</p><p dir="ltr">He sighed. His daughter’s love life was nearly as complex as casting the Fidelius charm.</p><p dir="ltr">He returned to the drawer and withdrew the pipes, thoroughly convinced now that Dufresne would need a smoke and another glass of whiskey, after all.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Tom leaned back in his chair at the head of a long table on the top floor of the Leaky Cauldron. He lit a cigarette as he observed his knights. </p><p>He’d coined the term death eaters, but he decided the men before him weren’t death eaters… yet. They still had years of training to go, and now, he had to transform their way of thinking as well. These men were far too attached to their pureblood ideologies. Tom had once thought to use that weakness to manipulate them into complete loyalty and devotion to his cause. However, Hermione had somewhat opened Tom’s eyes. The truth was, purebloods were slowly dying out, according to Tom’s research. In the coming years, the majority of the magical population would be half-blood at best. The social and political climate was swiftly changing. If Tom was to gain any kind of real power and sustain it, then he would need to find a way to pander to the purebloods <em> and </em> the progressives.</p><p>Tom had once thought absolute magical power and the invocation of fear was the answer, but Hermione had made him see that a much more delicate approach could be possible.</p><p>It was a tricky scenario, but Tom didn’t see any options left to him. </p><p>Besides, his knights would have to accept Hermione as his wife one day, and that would be no easy feat. He would not allow disrespect to go unpunished, and Dolohov had been repeatedly trying his patience of late.</p><p>In a way, Hermione had completely derailed his carefully laid plans. He’d intended to travel for several years to search out forgotten and arcane forms of magic. Now he was tied to London indefinitely. He’d intended to create horcruxes from artifacts belonging to the founders of Hogwarts, but now he had other objects in mind. He’d even considered quitting his job at Borgin and Burkes. Lastly, he’d intended to one day unleash his basilisk upon the halls of Hogwarts again, but now the thought of harming muggleborns twisted his stomach into knots.</p><p>He inhaled deeply from his cigarette as he traced the rim of his coffee cup with his fingertips.</p><p><em> Plans change </em>, he thought as he exhaled smoke.</p><p>As long as the result was the same, why did it matter how he got there? Tom was a gifted manipulator. A skilled orator. He could shift the strategy in order to get everything he wanted.</p><p>That was the plan anyway, at the end of the day…</p><p>For Tom to have everything he wanted.</p><p>He wanted power… and he wanted <em> Hermione </em>.</p><p>He cleared his throat, and the buzzing room fell silent.</p><p>“Nott, Avery,” he began. “Are you both successfully brewing the potion?”</p><p>Acacius nodded. “We’ve got several cauldron’s worth of Polyjuice in the making. It should be done by the time we act.”</p><p>Tom nodded. “Do <em> not </em> fuck up the potion. We don’t have room for mistakes.” He eyed his followers. “This will send a message to the entire world that the statute of secrecy is weak and ineffective. Soon, all of London will be calling for its destruction… and when they do, we will be the answer to their pleas.”</p><p>He turned his gaze upon Mulciber. “What news from the ministry?”</p><p>The dark haired Orin grumbled, “They’re saying there will one day be a muggleborn Minister for Magic. There was a meeting of the Wizengamot and it was brought up as a topic of discussion.”</p><p>“I walked out,” said Abraxas smugly. “I’ve no idea why they are entertaining such a thing, but I will not stand idly by and allow it to happen. We should be acting against this nonsense.”</p><p>Tom said nothing for a few moments. He took a drag from his cigarette, then he spoke. “Unfortunately, it may be unavoidable.”</p><p>There were shouts of outrage around the table. Dolohov was quiet for once, as he sat in silent observance. </p><p>“You can’t be serious, T- er, <em>my</em> <em>Lord…</em> Isn’t this the whole purpose of our meeting together? Isn’t this what the knights were formed for? We’ve talked about this since fourth year, haven’t we?” asked Lestrange. “All of our training, is it for nothing? We can’t let something like this stand. It’s an outrage.”</p><p>Tom blew smoke out calmly as his black eyes bore into Lestrange’s. Then he waved his wand, dimming the lights in the room. His followers murmured their discontent. </p><p>Tom flicked his wand and a series of numbers appeared, glowing in midair. </p><p>He pointed to the first number.  His followers flinched at the sight of his wand.</p><p>“This… is the number of purebloods living in Britain three hundred years ago.”</p><p>He pointed to the second number. “This is the number of purebloods one hundred and twenty years ago.” </p><p>There was deafening silence. The number had decreased by nearly half. Malfoy and Macnair glanced at one another.</p><p>He pointed to the third number. “This… this is the number of purebloods <em> now </em>.”</p><p>The amount was barely a third of the previous number.</p><p>Tom gazed at them all, meeting their eyes.</p><p>Acacius Nott cleared his throat, speaking up. “Well that’s… that’s because so many families are marrying mudbloods. It’s despicable. Doesn’t mean anything though. It just means we need to work harder to outlaw intermarrying.”</p><p>Lestrange nodded. “Right… Walburga’s cousin Araminta is proposing a law, going to make muggle hunting legal and then-“</p><p>“Unfortunately,” Tom interrupted. “This number has little to do with the amount of purebloods intermarrying, and more to do with the amount of children being produced. A pureblood marriage in 1806 produced a median of five heirs. That average is now down to one and a half. I have done my research at length.”</p><p>“Perhaps pureblood families are simply having less children as a rule. Times change, my Lord. These modern times are different than the old days were.”</p><p>Tom tossed a scroll into the table. “This is a report detailing the rise in cases of infertility and sterility among pureblood families in Great Britain.” He pointed to the scroll. “That is data from St. Mungo’s.”</p><p>His knights stared at the scroll as if it were a serpent poised to strike at them. </p><p>Tom lit another cigarette. “I have data from France, Germany, and Bulgaria as well; their magical hospitals keep remarkably accurate records. When you analyze the statistics, there certainly seems to be a trend.”</p><p>Rosier swallowed, staring at the scroll.</p><p>“What are you trying to say, Tom?”</p><p>Tom flicked his eyes at Abraxas. </p><p>Malfoy gulped and corrected himself. “My Lord.”</p><p>“I’m saying that you may very well keep on with your inbreeding, but according to my calculations, by the year 2120, the pureblood population will be all but extinct. Half-bloods will be the majority.”</p><p>“This is a <em> lie </em> ,” snarled Avery. “We went along with everything you’ve wanted, since Hogwarts. We did everything you told us to, we cursed other students, we altered Professor Nobbins’ memory… we did it all without complaint and you never got your hands dirty. Now we act out all of your plans like little puppets and you’re pulling all the strings... But <em> this </em>? This is how you repay us?”</p><p>Tom smirked. </p><p>Lestrange stood as if to leave. “This is what we get for putting our faith in a half-blood. I knew it would lead to no good-“</p><p>His voice was suddenly cut off. He gripped his throat, but was nearly knocked off balance when an invisible force shoved him roughly into his seat. He turned his gaze onto Tom, eyes shining with fear.</p><p>“You will all go along with the program, or you will not like the consequences.”</p><p>The room was filled with stark silence.</p><p>“Now,” Tom continued. “There is no reason why, despite this minor issue of blood purity, the old families cannot still hold the power in our society. I realize that your blood purity standards lend you all a sense of superiority and that your lineages are deeply steeped in this tradition, but if you do not wish for your family lines to end due to genetic abnormalities in the bloodline, then you might want to consider tweaking your childish prejudices and relinquish your obstinacy in favor of <em> real </em> power. This is something that we can all accomplish together, if we can once again become of like mind and purpose. It is up to you. However, I will say this… I, Lord Voldemort, do not intend to stop. You are either with me, or against me, and if you are against me, you will live only long enough to regret your mistake. The teetering power of your families and the anciency of your fading magical bloodlines will mean nothing next to my power and influence. I can give you all position and security, or I can destroy you. Take your pick.”</p><p>Silence ensued. A few of his death eaters seemed to be taking his words into consideration, whereas several others were red-faced with anger, but dared not to defy him. </p><p>“No arguments, then?” </p><p>Abraxas and Dolohov were tight-lipped and breathing heavily, but said nothing. Rosier still stared at the scroll.</p><p>Of course, Tom wanted them to be angry. He was provoking them on purpose. </p><p>Poking the bear was the easiest way to discover who among them would be loyal… and who among them deserved a killing curse to the heart.</p><p>“Good,” Tom said with a congenial smile as he straightened his tie. “Then we will discuss our plans… but only after a round of legilimency, of course.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Myra Grimblehawk and Jack McLaggen circled around the back of the ramshackle building, and Hermione, Zeus Vane, and Gaspard approached the front. </p><p>A rickety sign was staked into the spotty grass, painted with a little crystal ball and lettering which read, “Madam Sybyll’s Tarot &amp; Psychic Readings.”</p><p>A witch who had failed to make a name for herself as a seer in the magical community had turned to muggle London in desperation. She was garnering quite a reputation amongst the muggles for her tarot readings &amp; her ability to read tea leaves, which was a legal gray area as some muggles did believe in divination, and therefore wasn’t a direct violation of the statute of secrecy. </p><p>However, this witch also thought she could sell real magical potions under the table to the muggles, just to line her pockets a bit more. </p><p>That was not a gray area.</p><p>For several weeks, the DMLE had investigated the results of this potion abuse in no less than 26 muggles, to whom she had sold love potions, Anti-Paralysis potion, Draught of Peace, Murtlap Essence, Mopsus Potion, Dreamless Sleep Potion, and a Shrinking Potion. </p><p>The DMLE had been forced to conduct several obliviations accompanied by memory charms, and a healer had been called in to administer antidotes.</p><p>They had been monitoring her practice for some time, but considered it finally hazardous when several coerced marriages took place under the influence of Amortentia. </p><p>Another auror, Dara Bletchley, had entered the shop in disguise as a muggle and gathered evidence, convincing the witch to sell her a few potions.</p><p>Once the lab had tested them and determined that they did indeed have magical properties, they’d planned to conduct a raid and make the appropriate arrests. </p><p>The DMLE was initially under orders to arrest Madam Sybyll’s House elf, Patter, for his part in brewing the potions, but Hermione raised a huge stink with the ministry and insisted that he be set free, on account of his inability to deny any order from his mistress. She then began to educate the higher ups in the ministry, much to Gaspard’s amusement, about the laws governing house elf magic. They were more than happy to change their orders if only to get Hermione to settle down. </p><p>Gaspard had instructed her as to the proper spells involved in making arrests, how to detain criminals, and had ensured that Hermione had the OWEs (Ordinary Wizarding Entitlements) memorized. She wouldn’t be engaging in the raid on this particular excursion, but she had to know the procedure all the same. The raid was a part of her training, for which she was required to complete at least one for observational purposes before being sent into the field. </p><p>They began by casting enchantments which prevented apparation around the perimeter of the establishment. Gaspard turned to Hermione. “You’ll stay out here and wait, then we will bring the prisoners outside. Just watch and observe how they are detained.”</p><p>As soon as the aurors entered the building, there was a great commotion. Hermione heard shouts coming from inside the building. </p><p>Someone on the top floor yelled, “Aurors!” </p><p>Then Hermione noticed a window being opened on the top floor. She quickly cast a disillusionment charm on herself and watched as a woman with black hair tried to squeeze through the upstairs window. She was a few stones too heavy to fit through, but with a few well-placed charms, she went tumbling onto the roof. </p><p>Somehow the woman was able to form a sort of magical bridge which she began to take to cross over to the building next door, but Hermione decided she wouldn’t let her get that far.</p><p>“Incarcerous,” Hermione whispered, aiming her wand at the woman, and then she quickly cast a levitation charm to prevent the woman from spiraling to the ground in her binds. </p><p>“Expelliarmus,” she muttered, sending the woman’s wand flying as the witch shrieked and struggled against the binds. </p><p>With some effort, Hermione held the levitating charm, but the woman was quite heavy, so when Hermione was convinced she wouldn’t be injured, she let her drop to the alleyway beside her.</p><p>Gaspard came running out through the back door and ran around the building, only to find Hermione standing there above the witch. He looked up at the window.</p><p>“Let me go!” shouted the witch. “My practice is completely legal and I have a license to practice divination given <em> by </em> the ministry-“</p><p>“Sure it is,” muttered Gaspard. He flicked his eyes at Hermione. “You weren’t supposed to engage, Dumbledore.” There was no hint of irritation in his voice. His lips twitched staring down at the shrieking witch.</p><p>“Did you want me to let her go over to the next building and <em> apparate </em> away? It was only too easy to apprehend her.” Hermione winced. “A bit of a struggle with the levitation charm, though.”</p><p>Gaspard coughed to hide his laugh. “Very well, recite her OWEs then and let’s be done with this. We have evidence to confiscate.”</p><p>Zeus Vane and Myra Grimblehawk tossed her assistants on the ground next to her and as Hermione recited the entitlements, they all cheered and clapped her on the back, much to the outrage of the faux psychic. </p><p>“First arrest, Dumbledore,” said McLaggen. “How do you feel?”</p><p>“Like I’d like a bit more of a challenge next time,” she muttered as she cast a spell shackling the woman’s wrists. </p><p>Vane and McLaggen guffawed loudly and then took off down the street to obliviate a few muggles who’d happened to be passing by when the arrests were made.</p><p>Gaspard stood staring at her. When she lifted the witch onto her feet, he gave her a curt nod.</p><p>“You set this all up to see if I would follow orders, didn’t you?” Hermione looked at him questioningly.</p><p>He shrugged. “I wanted to see what you would do. You did well, in any case. It is always best to follow direct orders, but I can see you’re going to have difficulty with that.” </p><p>“I’ll try my best, Ga- Mr. Dufresne.”</p><p>His blue eyes met hers. “Come. I’ll show you how to register a prisoner into Azkaban’s holding cells.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Once the team had dropped the prisoners off at Azkaban (followed by a diatribe from Hermione about the inefficiency of Azkaban’s security measures), they went through the building, confiscating magical objects, a cabinet full of illegal potions ingredients, as well as the potions themselves. There were crystal balls, scrying mirrors, dowsing rods, various teas and cups for readings, and more divining paraphernalia. </p><p>A set of tarot cards were still spread out on the table where the last reading had been conducted. It reminded Hermione of the reading she’d been given a year ago. </p><p><em> Soulmates </em>.</p><p>She sighed and continued to collect evidence, placing it in bags which contained any enchantments.</p><p>After the raid had been completed and the contraband dropped off at the DMLE, McLaggen proposed that they all go out for drinks.</p><p>“You only get your first arrest once,” he murmured to Hermione with a wink. “What better excuse to have a drink, eh?”</p><p>Hermione’s lips twitched and she rolled her eyes, thinking to herself that Jack hardly needed another drink, judging from the redness of his face. She intuited that he probably had more than a few firewhiskeys every evening after work.</p><p>Gaspard politely declined, but Bones insisted.</p><p>“It’s been ages since you went out with us,” he hedged.</p><p>“All he’s gonna do is go home and have a drink by himself, anyway,” Vane muttered under his breath.</p><p>Gaspard gave him a scathing look. “Fine.”</p><p>Cheers rang out from the group, though Gaspard was as stoic as always.</p><p>“Only <em> after </em> you all finish your paperwork,” he added, eliciting grumbles from the entire department.</p><p>Hermione smiled to herself and silently wondered what Gaspard was like after a few drinks.</p><p> </p><hr/><p><br/>
“Tell me, Dumbledore… what’s your dad like behind closed doors?”</p><p>The aurors sat at a rounded booth in a secluded corner of the Three Broomsticks. Hermione happened to be squished in between Gaspard and Dara Bletchley, which was a bit too close for comfort. Their thighs kept brushing, and she found herself a bit distracted by the hardness of his shoulder against hers. Her boss also smelled divine, his scent an intermingling of spice, leather, and sandalwood. </p><p>Tom’s scent conjured up images of crisp, clear nighttime, or an evergreen forest by the ocean… but Gaspard smelled like a roaring bonfire and aged cherry wood.</p><p>In any case, it was distracting as hell. </p><p>“He’s pretty well the same I suppose… but much funnier. He keeps me in stitches,” she replied.</p><p>“That sounds about right,” said Dara. </p><p>“Did he train you? Is that how you were able to bypass so much of the training?” asked Myra. She tried not to seem jealous, but one couldn’t help but notice that she was a bit put out at being upstaged by such a young witch.</p><p>“He has trained me quite a bit,” Hermione responded generously. </p><p>“I can’t see any other way a homeschooled witch would be so advanced,” said Vane gruffly. </p><p>Hermione didn’t respond. She just kept her head low, to avoid shining any extra light on her past. She felt Gaspard’s eyes on her, but she didn’t return the regard.</p><p>Throughout the night she listened intently to their stories about the war, detailing the arrests of dark wizards and many of Grindelwald’s acolytes. The aurors recounted the story of Gaspard’s duel with Hausler and they each started comparing scars.</p><p>She fielded questions about her past, and her relationship with Dumbledore. Dara in particular seemed interested in Hermione’s love life, questioning her about her entanglement with Alphard Black. </p><p>She leaned over and whispered to Hermione, “Alphard and I courted briefly in fourth year.”</p><p>“Oh,” Hermione murmured in surprise. “Well, it wasn’t some intense love affair, the way the papers made it sound.”</p><p>“He was a <em> great </em> kisser,” Dara giggled, already succumbing to the effects of the alcohol.</p><p>Hermione’s cheeks heated. “I suppose,” she murmured shyly, painfully aware of Gaspard’s presence at her other side.</p><p>“You know who else the papers seem to want to pair you up with?” Dara murmured conspiratorially, cutting her eyes over to where Gaspard sat, silently sipping his whiskey.</p><p>Hermione shook her head and cleared her throat. “No, I’ve no idea.” Before Dara could respond, Hermione lifted her hand and beckoned the waitress to bring another round of drinks.</p><p>As the hours wore on, Hermione began to suspect the entire department of an elaborate matchmaking scheme. </p><p>The male aurors slyly prompted Gaspard into retelling the tales of his most harrowing raids and arrests, reminding him of various wounds he’d sustained, magical creatures he’d encountered, and duels he’d won. He’d even been captured by an acolyte of Grindelwald’s in his younger years, but escaped narrowly by utilizing a clever, but underrated jinx. When Gaspard didn’t tell them with enough verve to suit the rest of the group, his aurors interrupted and took over the storytelling.</p><p>Hermione found the tales riveting of course,  but she sensed that her fellow aurors had ulterior motives.</p><p>The clown of the group, surprisingly, was Andrew Rabnott, and he kept the laughter ringing around the table all night. He even managed to provoke a few smiles and even some laughter from Dufresne himself, especially as the night wore on and the firewhiskey flowed freely.</p><p>By the time her co-workers began excusing themselves for the night, Hermione’s vision was beginning to blur. Her smiles were coming easily, and she laughed as Rabnott cracked another joke before bowing out. </p><p>At last, the final two aurors, Zyrus Broadmoor and Constance Pickering, took their leave, but only after purchasing both Gaspard and Hermione one more round of drinks. </p><p>“Drinks are on me,” said Zyrus with a wink. “See to it that he drinks it, Dumbledore. He needs a night out more than anybody.”</p><p>Hermione gave a wry smile and tossed a nervous glance at her employer. He sat staring into his whiskey, but his cheeks were flushed from the amount he’d imbibed throughout the night.</p><p>Hermione wasn’t sure how she felt about being left here alone with her boss, especially when it was so obvious that her co-workers had arranged it in such a conspicuous way. </p><p>Gaspard took another drink and sat the glass down on the table. Then he turned to Hermione. “Do you find this as obnoxious as I do?”</p><p>Hermione laughed easily, the alcohol coursing through her veins. “Oh, absolutely, they aren’t even trying to be subtle about it. I’m glad you said something.”</p><p>The corners of his lips turned up. “They mean well, but they’re a nosy bunch of idiots.”</p><p>Hermione laughed again, then held up her glass. “Shall we toast?”</p><p>His blue eyes flicked to hers, and she was suddenly intensely aware of how close he was. He lifted his glass. “To your first successful raid, Auror Dumbledore.”</p><p>Hermione grinned and their glasses clinked. His eyes lingered on hers as he took a drink.</p><p>“You’re smart keeping your head down about your past.”</p><p>Hermione nodded. “Perhaps people will stop asking questions over time.”</p><p>“Well,” he began, swirling the whiskey in his glass. “You’re an exceptional witch, so it’s not surprising that they have questions.”</p><p>Hermione’s cheeks heated beneath the compliment.</p><p>He flicked his eyes at her again. “So you did go to Hogwarts, then? What house?”</p><p>“Gryffindor.”</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>“What’s that supposed to mean?” she asked in a slighted tone.</p><p>“Brave. Headstrong. Doesn’t follow orders well. Doesn’t take no for an answer.”</p><p>“Excuse me?” she asked, affronted.</p><p>Gaspard smirked. “I suppose Gryffindor is seemly, considering your relationship with Dumbledore… but I would’ve pegged you for a Ravenclaw, given how clever your test answers were.”</p><p>Again, Hermione’s cheeks turned bright red, flushed from his praise and the overabundance of alcohol in her system. “You were a Ravenclaw?”</p><p>He looked at her and nodded. Hermione looked away and fixed her eyes on a spot across the room to avoid his penetrating blue eyes.</p><p>“From what I know of you,” she began, “I’d say you have a bit of Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, <em> and </em> Hufflepuff in you, Mr. Dufresne.”</p><p>He chuckled under his breath. “I would’ve preferred Hufflepuff, to be honest.”</p><p>Hermione’s brows knit. “Why is that?”</p><p>He inclined his head. “Most of my friends were in Hufflepuff, so there’s that. Besides, have you ever tried to answer a perplexing riddle when you’re exhausted, or when you’ve spent the night sneaking wine with your friends from the house elves in the kitchens? It’s absolutely aggravating.” </p><p>Hermione burst into laughter. “You, a rule breaker? I cannot picture it.”</p><p>He shook his head. “Oh, I was one of the worst. I crashed in Hufflepuff’s common room on multiple occasions just because I was too toasted to answer the bloody riddle.”</p><p>It took Hermione more than a few moments to sober up, overcome with laughter, but when she did, she asked, “Was your wife in Hufflepuff?”</p><p>He nodded, cutting his eyes over at her.</p><p>Silence stretched for a few minutes as they finished their drinks. </p><p>Hermione cleared her throat. “Did you ever discover anything with regards to the vanishing cabinet?”</p><p>He stopped mid-drink. “How did you know about it?”</p><p>“Oh,” she murmured. “Bones let it slip.”</p><p>He blinked. “You’re gifted at uncovering information, I’ll give you that.” Then he muttered, “No, we didn’t find anything.”</p><p>Hermione nodded. She shifted in her seat nervously, but felt herself flush when her thigh brushed against his.</p><p>From her peripheral vision, she could see him swallow, his throat bobbing slightly as he moved away a bit, clearing his throat.</p><p>“You’re off work tomorrow,” he said, changing the subject. “Any particular plans?”</p><p>She looked at him. “Well, I have a book signing in the morning at Flourish and Blotts, for my spellbook. Then in the afternoon I’m supposed to have tea at Malfoy Manor.”</p><p>His eyebrows rose. “Busy witch.” He finished off his whiskey. “I have to admit, I can’t imagine you as a friend of the Malfoys.”</p><p>“Well, to be honest, I haven’t seen or heard from Abraxas in months. I attended Ostara with him last year. I have no idea why he’s invited me to tea.”</p><p>He cleared his throat “He hangs around Tom Riddle quite a bit, does he not?”</p><p>She froze, flicking her eyes to his. Then, she nodded. “Yes… I believe so.”</p><p>He nodded slowly. “Congratulations, on your book, Dumbledore. It’s really a genius invention. Surprised no one else has thought of it.”</p><p>Hermione sucked her bottom lip between her teeth and bit down, masking the pleased smile that threatened to emerge. “Thank you.”</p><p>He nodded, observing her closely. “You’re welcome, Hermione.”</p><p>She swallowed at his use of her first name. “So,” she hedged. “Why are you so rigid now, if you were such a rule breaker in your school days?”</p><p>His eyebrows lifted slightly. “Rigid?”</p><p>Her eyes widened as she realized her error.</p><p>The alcohol was affecting her judgment, clearly.</p><p>“No, don’t mistake me. I don’t mean rigid in a bad way. I just mean that you’re very law-abiding, and you seem to follow the rulebook very closely when it comes to your work, which is how it should be.” </p><p>He turned his glacial gaze on her. “Do you prefer men who break the law, Dumbledore?”</p><p>Her lips parted as she gleaned his meaning. She looked away, murmuring, “Um… no. That’s not a quality I’ve ever found attractive.”</p><p>He nodded and turned away, looking ahead. “If I am rigid, I don’t mind you saying so.” He pressed his tongue against his cheek and looked down at his empty glass, which he still held in his hand. “I suppose I changed after Rose died.” He tilted his head toward Hermione. “If I had followed the rules more closely rather than running my own self-appointed operation, she might still be alive.”</p><p>Hermione watched his face and for the first time, she felt like she could read him. His carefully crafted stone facade was a mask for pain. He carried it like a cross. He blamed himself for his wife’s death, when it was probably not his fault at all.</p><p>Hermione lifted her hand and began to place it on his, but then realized vaguely, in the back of her befuddled mind, that it was inappropriate. “I… I’m sorry, Mr. Dufresne. You shouldn’t blame yourself. These things happen.”</p><p> He was quiet, but he flicked his eyes to hers. </p><p>She continued, “I lost a lot of people that were dear to me in the war. My own parents… I had to obliviate them to make sure they were protected. They’re still in Australia, as far as I know.” Suddenly, it was as if she was back in the Great Hall of Hogwarts after the battle. “The worst part was numbering the dead after the battle. It didn’t even feel real.”</p><p>Gaspard was silent, allowing her to express herself.</p><p>She looked at him and laughed. “I’m afraid I’ve had too much to drink, Mr. Dufresne. I’m sitting here reliving all of my trauma as if you even asked.”</p><p>“We are alone, Hermione. You can call me Gaspard.”</p><p>“Forgive me… Gaspard.”</p><p>“You’re right. I didn’t ask. But that’s only because I assumed it would be too difficult for you to articulate. I don’t relish causing you to relive it.”</p><p>“I imagine it’s much like talking about your wife.”</p><p>His jaw tensed, but he shook his head. “I’ve had twenty years to come to terms with it. You’ve barely had two months.”</p><p>Hermione’s eyes wandered his face. She suddenly had the urge to touch him, but she squashed it, attributing her embarrassing urges to the drink. </p><p>Gaspard stared into the fireplace across the room. It was getting extremely late, the patrons were all leaving, and the fire was dying out.</p><p>“What are you thinking about?” she asked softly.</p><p>He turned to gaze at her, and his eyes were pools of cerulean. “Right now?”</p><p>She nodded. “Mhmm.”</p><p>He swallowed, and his eyes fell to her lips. “I’m thinking about what your mouth tastes like.”</p><p>Her lips parted as her jaw dropped.</p><p>The corners of his lips turned up. He muttered calmly, “I suppose the firewhiskey has gotten to me, after all.”</p><p>She looked at her hands. “You mean… you wouldn’t be thinking that way if you weren’t drunk?”</p><p>He shook his head slowly. “No, Hermione. I mean that I wouldn’t have said it out loud if I wasn’t drunk.”</p><p>Her heart suddenly beat very swiftly. “Should we go?”</p><p>His eyes flicked to her and he nodded once. </p><p>He helped her to stand and then lifted his cloak over her shoulders and fixed it with a charm, to which she muttered her thanks. </p><p>It all happened in a blur. They were leaving the Three Broomsticks. He opened the door for her (she was pretty certain). They walked down the cobblestone pathway for a moment in silence, then she turned to him. </p><p>“I can’t apparate. I’m too sloshed.”</p><p>“I can apparate you, as long as you’re alright with sidelong.”</p><p>“Can you? Would you bring us… somewhere?”</p><p>“Somewhere.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>He gazed at her, reading her eyes carefully before he reached for her hand, then turned on his heel.</p><p>They apparated with a soft clap, and Hermione looked around to see that they stood on a sweeping wrap-around porch before a beautifully carved wooden door.</p><p>Gaspard still held her hand and they each looked down to where their hands were clasped.</p><p>Instead of releasing her, he lifted her hand in his and pulled her against his chest. </p><p>Their eyes met for the briefest of moments as he gauged her reaction, as if fully expecting her to stop him. </p><p>Then he kissed her.</p><p>At first, it felt strange to be kissing a wizard who wasn’t Tom Riddle. </p><p>But after a moment, the skillful maneuvering of his tongue between her lips awakened a sharp thrumming in her core. His scent licked at her senses, clouding her judgment like the alcohol in her veins. </p><p>His mouth slanted across hers, and she felt his hands on her waist, pulling her tighter against him.</p><p>Hermione let out a soft moan, and she heard him inhale sharply. Her hands, which were resting on his chest, slid up to tangle in his hair. His arms tightened around her, until the length of his body was pressed tightly to hers. Then she experienced some alarm, as she felt a hardness pressing against her stomach. </p><p>Her alarm quickly faded into lust. It happened so fast that she was barely aware of herself. She was far too drunk to be in this position, but she hardly cared. She slipped her hand between them and gently ran her fingertips over the bulge in his trousers.</p><p>For a moment, he froze. Then, without warning, she felt herself being lifted and pressed against the wall beside the door. His fingers dug into her thighs as she wrapped them around his waist. Their tongues danced sensually, and her skirt bunched up around her waist as his hips met hers. </p><p>Suddenly, white hot heat struck her core. His cock was hard and pressed against her center, separated by thin layers of fabric. He reached around to grip her backside and began to grind her hips against his. </p><p>Hermione broke the kiss, her mouth falling open with a startled gasp. He lowered his head and his lips met her throat, his tongue swiping hot and wet against her skin. He sucked gently as she rolled her hips against his with a lusty moan.</p><p>All at once, Gaspard froze. He held her still, breathing heavily against her throat. Hermione’s fingers unthreaded from his hair and she ran them down his cheek slowly. </p><p>She heard him swallow.</p><p>Then all at once, they broke apart. </p><p>Gaspard looked down at her with his pale blue eyes, his jaw clenching and unclenching as he warred with himself. His hand, which had been gripping her thighs, moved to rest on her waist as he dropped her gently to her feet.</p><p>He moved back so that the heat of their bodies separated slightly. He cleared his throat. “You’ve… had a lot to drink, Hermione.”</p><p>She shook her head. “I- it’s not that.”</p><p>His eyes searched her face in silence.</p><p>After a moment, she murmured, “I’ve just gotten out of a relationship. I still don’t know if I’m emotionally available.”</p><p>She flicked her eyes up to his, finding his expression as unreadable as always. “I mean… Forgive me, I’m not assuming you feel any particular way about me, but… I don’t know if I’m ready for anything, casual or otherwise.”</p><p>Gaspard watched her in silence for a few moments, his face blank aside from the twitching muscles in his cheek. Then, he straightened somewhat. “I understand, Hermione… and now you’ve told me, so you‘ve nothing to feel guilty about, right?” He cleared his throat. “And I won’t expect anything from you… Agreed?”</p><p>Hermione’s eyes widened a fraction. Then, she nodded slowly. </p><p>He nodded in return. “But just so we’re clear… I am attracted to you, Dumbledore. I think that should be pretty obvious by now. But if it isn’t… I’m saying it now.”</p><p>Hermione gazed at him. She let her eyes trail up his chest, observing the way his crisp white shirt clung tightly to his arms and shoulders. She’d never noticed the scars scattered along his forearms and on the sides of his neck, the remnants of little nicks and cuts, possibly the result of an explosion.</p><p>She met his gaze, which was settled on her with intensity. His usually glacial blue eyes were sparking with heat. </p><p>Hermione was beginning to understand how to read him. His eyes betrayed his hunger, though his expression was otherwise cold and detached. </p><p>Gaspard Dufresne wore a mask, which he never took off.</p><p>It made her want to discover the man behind the mask.</p><p>Hermione caught her breath. She couldn’t say that she felt more strongly for Gaspard than for Tom. That was a question she would rather not think about at the moment. All Hermione knew was that she was strongly attracted to the man in front of her, and she wanted to kiss him.</p><p>So she did.</p><p>She stood on her tiptoes, reached her arms around his neck, and threaded her hands in his dark hair. Then she pulled his face down to hers and their lips connected once more.</p><p>Gaspard sucked in a sharp breath through his nose.</p><p>He kissed her back gently, his tongue meeting hers in sensual movements. He was holding back, but Hermione still felt her breath leaving her lungs.</p><p>Kissing him felt <em> so good </em>. </p><p>His hand left her waist and trailed up her stomach, stroking softly, and then snaked up her spine to grip the back of her neck, pressing her lips more tightly against his. </p><p>She suddenly recalled the way his erection had pressed against her, the way he’d ground her hips against his, and her cheeks turned scarlet red.</p><p>His hand left her neck and he reached up to grip her cheeks, his fingers digging into her skin as he cupped her chin. His teeth tugged on her bottom lip as he pulled back, and he gazed down at her with azure flames in his eyes, holding her jaw steady as his eyes roved her face. </p><p>“Fuck,” he whispered. “I’ve never in my life had such inappropriate thoughts about an employee of mine.”</p><p>Hermione’s lips parted, her chest heaving with the anticipation of what he would do next.</p><p>He cocked his head as he looked down at her, then he let his eyes fall closed as he exhaled. “I think we should leave it there for tonight.”</p><p>Hermione blinked several times, and then nodded in agreement. “I think you’re right.”</p><p>He released her jaw, letting his fingertips graze her throat slowly before he backed away. “Let me see you back.”</p><p>He slid his hand around her waist and pulled her against him gently as he apparated her back to her flat.</p><p><br/>

<p>Hermione reached out in her sleep, only fractionally lucid as she searched the bed for a warmth that wasn’t there.</p><p>Then she opened her eyes to the darkness.</p><p>Her head split and sobriety washed over her in a disconcerting wave. She realized a moment later, as her hand touched the cold sheets beside her, that she was looking for Tom.</p><p>The night came rushing back, and Hermione felt an uneasy turning sensation in the pit of her stomach.</p><p>She didn’t necessarily regret kissing Gaspard. She liked him. She felt a genuine attraction to him…</p><p>But something just felt wrong. She didn’t want to cross lines when she wasn’t sure yet how she felt about her breakup with Tom.</p><p>Her chest tightened. If she hadn’t fallen in love with Tom, she would probably have fallen in love with Gaspard. She could see that path so clearly… and it led to happiness.</p><p>But unfortunately, she <em> had </em>fallen in love with Tom.</p><p>Part of her wanted to let him go. Some part of her wanted to move on with Gaspard… to touch him and taste him… to let him fill her life with peace and safety. To let him protect her in a <em> healthy </em>way, and not in the toxic way that Tom would.</p><p>But there was a sharp pricking in the center of her chest, like a chain connected to her heart that Tom himself controlled. She felt it pulling, twisting, tightening. </p><p>Every moment of the day, she wondered in the back of her mind where Tom was, what he was doing. She mused as she worked and trained, wondering whether he was learning new forms of magic, or whether he was in Albania searching for the diadem, or whether he was soon to find the locket and cup. Was there a way for her to prevent those things from happening? Did she have that much power over him?</p><p>Hermione felt tears rising to her eyes. For a brief moment before she’d ended things, she had almost started to believe there could be a future with him… but every time she allowed herself to picture it, the reality of who he was came crashing down, ripping the beautiful image to shreds.</p><p>She didn’t want to hurt Gaspard... He’d been hurt enough.</p><p>He deserved happiness.</p><p>She had told him the truth: that she wasn’t ready. He’d been understanding, assuring her that he didn’t expect anything…</p><p>But Hermione knew he would be hurt if she suddenly put up a wall.</p><p>Was she foolish for having kissed him? Or was she simply desperate for someone to break Tom’s hold off her heart?</p><p>Hermione blinked, and the tears brimmed over, trickling down her cheeks all at once.</p><p>She turned on her side, feeling cold, although her flat was warm. </p><p>It was too soon. Tom had branded her, like a scar from a badly healed wound. It would take years for him to fade.</p><p>If only Tom could change…</p><p>But he couldn’t. She knew that.</p><p>And even if he could, he wouldn’t. He didn’t want her that badly… not at the expense of his power.</p><p>He hadn’t even tried, in all honesty.</p><p>At first, Hermione had been glad that he kept his distance, giving her space.</p><p>But as the weeks dragged into months, Hermione began to feel a bit dejected that she hadn’t seen or heard from him. She’d expected him to break down her door… show up at her work… track her down and “drag her back by her hair” as he’d always threatened.</p><p>But he didn’t. In fact, it had been ghostly quiet since she read his last message on the parchment. </p><p>
<em> Hermione, answer me, so that I know you’re alright. </em>
</p><p>She probably should have responded… but she felt that to open the lines of communication would only complicate things more.</p><p>Was she really feeling demoralized by his failure to pursue her? Isn’t this what she had wanted? To break free of his grip?</p><p>Hermione sighed. Perhaps she had overestimated his feelings for her. After all, Dumbledore had told Harry that Voldemort was incapable of feeling. He’d even said that Tom hadn’t cried as a baby, insinuating that something was wrong with Tom from birth. </p><p>Perhaps it was true. </p><p>It was strange… whenever she was in Gaspard’s presence, she felt drawn to him. But when she was alone, all she could think about was Tom.</p><p>He felt <em> right… </em></p><p>… even though he was wrong.</p><p>If only Voldemort weren’t his fate.</p><p>A low sob escaped her throat and Hermione turned, burying her face into her pillow. She let her tears soak the pillowcase, her thin shoulders racked with sobs for a love she realized she would never have.</p><p>She missed Tom terribly.</p><p>Nothing felt right without him.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>The owners of Flourish &amp; Blotts were tickled pink to have Hermione Dumbledore  in their shop this Saturday morning. The line was backed out the door and trailed down the sidewalk of Diagon Alley. The shop was filled with patrons who wanted to purchase her recently released spellbook, <em> Hermione Dumbledore’s Compendious Searchable Spellbook </em>.</p><p>There was a large, gilded framed sign which sat on an easel by the door. It featured a sepia toned magical photograph of Hermione holding up a copy of her spellbook; she smiled and then covered her mouth with her hand, as if in shock at the magnificence of the publication.</p><p>Inside the shop, Hermione sat at a little table bearing stacks and stacks of books. She held the elaborate black and white quill which Tom had given her. She thought it fitting that she should sign her spellbook with the very quill which had belonged to famous spellbook author, Miranda Goshawk. </p><p>She chatted with the shop patrons who fawned over and adored her. Hermione was taken aback by how emotionally attached the public seemed to be to the image she’d built of herself. Even being a war hero in the future had not evoked such a reaction from the wizarding population. </p><p>Maybe this is what it felt like to be Harry Potter.</p><p>Hermione’s hand ached from the amount of times she signed her name with elaborate flourishes, addressing little notes to their specified friends and relatives, and children. </p><p>As the line filed in, which seemed to never end, Hermione looked up and found a middle-aged couple standing before her. The woman was pretty and sandy-haired, and wore a trendy set of caramel dress robes with a smart pencil skirt. Her husband was tall and had black hair which was slicked back in a fashionable way. He wore a sharply tailored suit and his keen blue eyes sparkled behind his spectacles. The two of them exuded wealth and opulence, appearing on the cutting edge of fashion.</p><p>“Hello,” said Hermione amiably.</p><p>The man held out his hand, “Hello and happy Saturday, Miss Dumbledore. My wife and I have followed your career since last February.” He gestured to his wife, who came forward. “My wife is a huge fan of your writings.”</p><p>The man’s wife held out her hand and Hermione shook it. “Your article about the house elf dilemma opened our eyes to the injustice of it all. We freed our house elf Dotsy and employed her fair and square, the way it should be!” She chuckled. “You should’ve seen Dotsy’s face when she saw your Witch Weekly spread! The photos of you and Piksy really took the cake.”</p><p>The man looked at his wife admiringly. “Fem is rather passionate about the subject now. She hopes to form a coalition to lobby for house elf rights in the ministry.”</p><p>Hermione’s eyebrows rose in shock. “Why… that’s absolutely marvelous! <em> Please </em> let me know how I can help.”</p><p>The couple grinned widely at that, and he held out their copies of the spellbook. “Well, you can start by signing these for us.”</p><p>Hermione laughed and took them, “I certainly think I can manage that.” She flipped open the book. “Who shall I make it out to?”</p><p>The man leaned forward, “Oh, please make it out to… well, it’s Fleamont but please write Monty… Yes, Monty and Euphemia Potter.”</p><p>Hermione’s eyes snapped up to the couple, her face betraying shock.. “Did you say Potter?”</p><p>The couple looked at one another in surprise. “Yes, Miss Dumbledore. Have you… heard of us?”</p><p>Standing before her were the parents of James Potter, Harry’s grandparents, the couple who’d taken Sirius in to live with them when he was a teenager.</p><p>Hermione recovered quickly. “Oh, yes, of course I have!” She leaned forward and murmured conspiratorially, “You are the inventor of Sleakeazy’s Hair Potion, are you not? I’ve always had the most unruly hair… your potion <em> saved </em> me!”</p><p>The couple looked at one another and burst into laughter. “Yes, I am!” He beamed. “I’m delighted to hear that you’ve found it useful.”</p><p>Euphemia leaned in and muttered, “He’s an absolute whizz with potions!”</p><p>“I’ll say,” chuckled Hermione. “Speaking of which, perhaps I should ask you… Have you heard of an old factory, called Portsmouth Potions? I believe it’s inoperable now.”</p><p>Their faces lit up. “Heard of it? They used to be the exclusive manufacturer of Sleakeazy’s! That is, until we sold the company. Unfortunately, the witch we sold it to moved her manufacturing to another factory, which gave them a bit of a hit. Then the old wizard fell ill, from what I’ve heard, and his son had no interest in potion brewing, as it were, so the factory shut down and fell into disrepair more recently.”</p><p>“Oh, I hate to hear that,” said Hermione sadly. “I ran across it while overseeing the building of Midas Bank. I may have an interest in purchasing it. Do you think you could put me in contact with the current owner?”</p><p>“Of course we could! We went to school with their son, of course. He was in our house at Hogwarts.” Monty winked at Hermione. “A fellow Gryffindor.”</p><p>Hermione’s lips spread into a wide smile. Her eyes moved back and forth between the couple. Someone behind them cleared their throat impatiently, and Hermione was suddenly alerted to the ever growing line behind them. “I’m afraid I’m a bit occupied at the moment, but I would love to have tea with you both sometime.”</p><p>The married pair looked at one another with wide eyes. Euphemia waved her wand, conjuring a card which she handed Hermione. “This is our address. Owl us <em> anytime</em>! Our schedule is flexible…” She lowered her voice. “We don’t have children yet.”</p><p>“In time,” Hermione murmured with a smile. “It was wonderful to meet you both.”</p><p>“Likewise,” Monty said with a bow. “Truly an honor.”</p><p>Hermione finished signing their spellbooks, and the couple disappeared through the front door of Flourish and Blotts. Hermione smiled to herself, pleased at having made new allies and potentially, new friends.</p><p>She signed and signed copies until her hand ached. By noonday, she was preparing to wrap up the signing, although the line hadn’t diminished in the slightest. If anything, it had grown, much to her dismay. She was speaking with the owner of Flourish and Blotts, discussing a date for another book signing, when the shadow of the next patron loomed over her. </p><p>“Just a few more and I’ll finish up for today,” she said under her breath to the owner. </p><p>With a nod, the bookshop owner ran off to inform the rest of the line standing outside of the date for the next signing.</p><p>Hermione’s gaze rose to the man in front of her, but she froze when she saw who it was.</p><p>Tom Riddle stood before her, dressed in his work robes and badge, with a spellbook in his hand. </p><p>Hermione’s mouth fell open, and he cocked a brow. </p><p>“Good day, Miss Dumbledore. I came to pick up a copy of your <em> marvelous </em> new spellbook.” He held up his copy with a grin.</p><p>Hermione realized her heart was beating out of her chest. She hadn’t expected to see him here, and the effect his presence had upon her composure was destructive. “Hello, Tom.”</p><p>He smirked and tossed the book onto the table, then opened its cover. Her eyes trailed over the tendons of his hand and his long fingers as he held the book open. She noticed he no longer wore his horcrux ring.</p><p>“Nice quill,” he commented.</p><p>She glanced at it and smiled. “Thank you. It once belonged to Miranda Goshawk.”</p><p>“Did it now! Where did you get it?”</p><p>Her gaze lifted to meet his penetrating black orbs. Their eyes met for only a moment, but what they communicated was unnerving. Though his facial expression was congenial and polite, his eyes were blazing with an intense level of possessiveness.</p><p>“An old boyfriend gave it to me.”</p><p>“He must’ve gone to a lot of trouble to get it for you.”</p><p>She shrugged. “I wouldn’t know. He rarely told me the things he did.”</p><p>He nodded pensively. “Perhaps he should’ve been more forthcoming.”</p><p>Their eyes met for a beat, but Hermione looked away quickly. What was his game?</p><p>“Who shall I make it out to?”</p><p>He inclined his head. “Let’s try… Mr. and Mrs. Riddle.”</p><p>“Oh?” she asked saucily. “Have you gotten married? Congratulations.”</p><p>“Not yet,” he murmured with a wink. </p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes and signed the book as he requested. Then she handed it to him. “A memento. For you to remember me by.”</p><p>Tom’s lips spread into a devastating grin, revealing his brilliant white teeth as he took the book, letting his fingers brush hers. “Oh, I have plenty of memories, little witch.” His eyes flicked over her body in a heated glance. </p><p>Hermione took a deep breath and looked away, her smile fading. “I do have other books to sign.”</p><p>“I heard you just now speaking with the owner. You said you were done for the day.”</p><p>“I will sign a few more.”</p><p>“And after?”</p><p>Her eyes rose to meet his. “I’m having tea… at Malfoy Manor.” She spoke quietly, as the other patrons in the line had begun to listen in. “I thought you worked on Saturdays.”</p><p>“I do,” he said with a nod. “I spent my lunch break standing in this long line to see the Witch of the Year.”</p><p>Hermione swallowed. She replied a bit breathlessly, “I hope you got what you wanted.”</p><p>He chuckled. “Unfortunately not. I’d be walking out of here with <em> you </em> if that were the case.”</p><p>Hermione’s eyes widened and there were gasps and whispers from the rest of the line. </p><p>Tom smiled playfully at Hermione, his black eyes locked on hers. “Good day, Miss Dumbledore.”</p><p>Hermione watched him leave, her chest tight and her stomach turning flips.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>“The famous Hermione Dumbledore.”</p><p>Abraxas Malfoy stood on the other side of Malfoy Manor’s elaborate set of double doors, grinning from ear to ear. His two house elves held the heavy doors open for him. </p><p>“It’s been my most earnest dream to see you again.”</p><p>Hermione gave him a small smile, but something in his grin was different than the last time she’d seen him. It bore sinister traces, and she couldn’t quite put her finger on what had changed.</p><p>”I am very glad you invited me to tea, Mr. Malfoy. Perhaps we may at last have that conversation about our differing political opinions.”</p><p>He bowed low. “But of course… we should. Come this way. I have tea already prepared.”</p><p>”You mean your house elves do.”</p><p>He chuckled. “I’ve already partaken of your skillfully written articles on the subject, Miss Dumbledore. There’s no need for a lecture. If I were to free these elves, I guarantee you, my mother would skin my hide. She is still the lady of this manor, after all.”</p><p>Hermione glanced at him. “I suppose it’s time for you to find your own lady, then.”</p><p>He grinned widely. “Are you offering?”</p><p>Hermione chuckled and looked away, observing the opulent interior of the manor as they walked. “I think your mother might keel over if she knew you’d married a Gryffindor.”</p><p>”Exceptions can always be made. That is, unless you’re already spoken for.”</p><p>”No,” she murmured as they neared a round table set with tea. “I’m quite unattached… and not looking to change that status anytime soon.”</p><p>”Ah, yes. You are a big bad auror now. How could I forget?”</p><p>At least he had the decency to keep the house elves out and serve the tea himself. He poured her a cup and handed the saucer and cup to Hermione.</p><p>“You seem a bit disdainful, Mr. Malfoy.”</p><p>The corners of his lips turned up ruefully and he placed a hand on his cravat. “Forgive me, but I have no love for aurors, I’m afraid. Particularly the head, Dufresne. He’s a stickler. I’d prefer someone more lenient… someone who deals in grey, rather than white and black.”</p><p>”You mean someone who would let you get away with things because you’re a Malfoy?”</p><p>He chuckled, his silver eyes gleaming into hers. “You certainly do love to call me out, don’t you, Miss Dumbledore? Well, perhaps. My family has overseen British wizarding society for hundreds of years, and we have long held a seat in the Wizengamot, since its inception.“ He took a sip of his tea. “I do not agree with every single law that has been passed, no. But that is because my family recalls a day when some of those laws did not exist.”</p><p>Hermione cocked a brow. “I do agree that some of the laws need to be changed… however, I’m not sure we would agree on which laws.”</p><p>”Perhaps not. By the by, I must congratulate you on your new book. Mine has only just arrived by owl this morning. A brilliant achievement.”</p><p>Hermione sipped her tea. “Thank you, Mr. Malfoy.”</p><p>”I see that we have lost our first name basis in the course of the year.”</p><p>”You may call me Hermione.”</p><p>His eyes glittered like goblin-wrought steel. “What are your thoughts on purebloods keeping their blood pure, Hermione?”</p><p>The suddenness of his question caught Hermione off-guard. Her eyebrows rose sharply. “I would have assumed, having read my articles, that you would already know my opinions.”</p><p>He cocked his head. “I’d like to hear it from you.”</p><p>Hermione took a deep breath. “Well… I certainly don’t begrudge purebloods for marrying who they desire. But to wish harm on witches and wizards who do not possess entirely magical blood, is a hate crime. I know muggleborns who are more magically skilled and knowledgeable than most purebloods. To desire their rights diminished because of the circumstances of their birth is bigoted at best. Blood status has no bearing upon magical skill, nor character, which is the ruler by which we should be judging one another.”</p><p>Malfoy took another sip of tea, cutting his eyes at her slyly. Then, he cleared his throat. “Some believe that if we do not intermarry with muggleborns, our lines will begin to die out. What are your thoughts on this?”</p><p>Hermione’s brows knit. “I had not heard that particular theory, but it does make sense. Muggles are far ahead of wizards in terms of scientific study. The study of genetics and DNA has revealed that consistent inbreeding leads to birth defects and infertility. So… if there are only twenty-eight families that are considered viable… someone’s bound to marry their cousin. Over time, that could result in a drop in mental acuity and reproductive health.”</p><p>Malfoy blinked several times, processing the information. </p><p>“Why do you ask this, Abraxas?”</p><p>He smiled, his face clearing. “No reason. I was simply curious of your thoughts, as these things have been bandied about recently.”</p><p>”By who?”</p><p>”Ahem,” he cleared his throat, seeming uncomfortable. “Mr. Riddle, for one, seems to be exploring the topic in depth. I was unsure as to where he’d heard this information.”</p><p>Hermione’s brow furrowed, and she asked slowly, ”Why would you think to ask me?”</p><p>His eyebrows rose, and he lifted his chin, smiling at her innocently. “Oh… but because of your articles, of course. I am not aware of any other witch or wizard who is as knowledgeable on the subject as you seem to be. Forgive me for picking your brain.” He smiled tightly, and refilled her tea cup. “Now, do update me on your life these past months.”</p><p>———————</p><p>After an awkward and stilted conversation, he led Hermione to the library, eagerly intent on showing her his new collection of magical encyclopedias and divination handbooks. </p><p>Hermione spent a good amount of time wandering the shelves, even climbing the staircase and exploring the upper level of the magnificent archive. She’d almost forgotten that Malfoy was there, until she reached a table where a stack of books lay. She laid her hand on the book on top, which was a book about scrying, when Malfoy cleared his throat. “Those actually belong to a friend.”</p><p>Hermione turned. “Oh… forgive me. Who do they belong to?”</p><p>His eyes flicked to the stack and then back to Hermione. “Ahem… They belong to Mr. Riddle. I do believe he intends to come back for them this evening. He actually instructed me to keep the library locked, but…” He smiled slowly at Hermione. “How could I deny you the opportunity to browse, when your face lights up so beautifully around books?”</p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes, but blushed all the same. “No worries, Mr. Malfoy. I shall not touch his books.”</p><p>”I believe you. Please, browse to your heart’s content. I must see to some business in the drawing room for a moment, but I shall return shortly.”</p><p>Hermione nodded, and turned back to the shelves as he retreated, his shoes clacking on the floor as he walked away. </p><p>When she at last heard the double doors close, she turned back to the table and examined the stack of books.</p><p>On top was a book called <em>The Sorcery of Scrying</em>. Beneath it were a few muggle books, including one book of poetry that she had recommended to Tom months ago, The Wasteland by TS Eliot. She found a page dog-eared in the middle. She smiled to herself as she thought of him reading it, even though they weren’t together anymore. It somehow endeared him to her more. </p><p>She thought of their encounter earlier that day. It was the first time she’d seen him since she returned his ring and left him standing in Borgin and Burkes.</p><p>He looked well. Very fit, in fact…</p><p>… and the way he had looked at her…</p><p>… it was as if they’d never parted.</p><p>Hermione shook her head. She couldn’t entertain those thoughts. </p><p>Because he wouldn’t change, she was sure. If she allowed him, he would be her destruction. </p><p>One of them was bound to destroy the other… there was no other alternative. </p><p>Because Hermione wouldn’t let him become Voldemort. She would have to kill him before she would allow that to happen.</p><p>Although… she was rather perplexed by the questions Abraxas had laid to her. Why would Tom be questioning pureblood intermarrying? Was Tom the one who had put him up to it? Was this invitation to tea a ploy of Tom’s?</p><p>She sighed, thoroughly confused, and went through the rest of the stack of books. </p><p>Then she froze. </p><p>Her hand had landed on a black leather journal, one with gilded corners. Her heart suddenly began to beat swiftly.</p><p>She cast a glance at the doors to ensure she was alone, and then flipped the journal over. Sure enough, she saw the golden letters etched into it, reading <em>Tom Marvolo Riddle</em>. </p><p>It looked exactly like the one Harry had destroyed in the chamber of secrets. </p><p>Her breath caught as she flipped through its pages. Empty.</p><p>Hermione bit her lip. If she’d only kept his ring, then she would have both of his horcruxes.</p><p>Should she take it?</p><p>She twisted her lips to the side as she contemplated.</p><p>She didn’t have the heart to destroy it… not yet. But perhaps, if there was a future time when it was necessary for her to do so, then it would be best if she had the journal in her possession. All she would have to do is kill the basilisk. Perhaps she should go ahead and do it… then she could keep a fang, just in case.</p><p>Her heart sunk at the thought that she might one day have to kill Tom. </p><p>She cast another glance back at the double doors, then turned back and unhooked her beaded bag from her bracelet. She engorged it, and rifled through it to find an old book which she hadn’t been particularly fond of. She settled on Rita Skeeter’s <em>The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore.</em> </p><p>Hermione cast a transfiguration spell and modified the book until it became a replica of the journal. It took her a few tries, but she finally held in her hand a perfect copy. She held her breath as she placed it carefully back in the stack of books where it had belonged. </p><p>She hoped Tom wouldn’t notice that it was a replica. Could he tell that it didn’t bear his magical signatures? She would simply have to take the chance. </p><p>Besides… she might even have a few questions for the piece of soul he’d locked away in the horcrux.</p><p>Hermione flicked her wand, attempting to shrink the journal, and to her surprise, it did shrink.</p><p>Her brow furrowed. <em>Funny</em>, she thought. <em>I was sure that horcruxes were impervious to most spells.</em></p><p>She made a mental note to conduct more experiments on the journal. Perhaps she could learn more about horcruxes and their magic in the process.</p><p>She tucked the journal into her beaded bag and shrunk it. Then she reattached it to her bracelet, just in time. A moment later, the double doors opened, and Malfoy returned.</p><p>”Come, Miss Dumbledore. Let us take a turn about the gardens. The roses are just beginning to bud.”</p><p>Hermione smiled and took his arm. He grinned deviously at her as he led her through the expansive halls and outside. They passed down the stone steps and into the dreamy gardens of the manor. Large oak trees towered overhead, and she looked out over the hedge maze, and the endless pathways lined with rose bushes. It reminded her of her favorite childhood book, Alice in Wonderland.</p><p>”Did you know, Hermione, that our annual Ostara Ball is being held next weekend?”</p><p>”<em>Oh</em>,” she mumbled. “I had forgotten.”</p><p>”You recall that we attended together last year…”</p><p>”Of course I do.”</p><p>He turned to her, stopping their striding abruptly. “I would be honored if you would attend this year, Hermione.”</p><p>Her lips parted, and her eyebrows rose slightly. “Well… I’ll have to check my calendar. But if I’m available, I suppose I could.”</p><p>He smiled, then took her hand in his gloved one and lifted it to his mouth, pressing his lips to skin as he ran his hand gently over hers. “Would you allow me to escort you?”</p><p>Her mouth fell open slightly. Then she swallowed. “I don’t see why not.”</p><p>His lips spread into a wide grin, his gray eyes gleaming like knives. “How marvelous. Do let me know as soon as possible if you can attend. I will look for your owl.”</p><p>Hermione watched him, and something in her heart told her it was all an act. But that was just as well, because Hermione wanted to know what exactly Abraxas Malfoy was up to. </p><p>“Perfect,” she smiled, her brown eyes sparking with amber flames. </p>

<p>Hermione stared at the journal. She’d held it in her possession for several days, watching it, thinking about it. She couldn’t understand why Tom would have just left it in a stack of books at Malfoy Manor. It didn’t seem like something Tom would do… given the obsessive way that he’d protected his horcruxes in her time. </p><p>But then again, by that time, he’d gained many, many enemies. Perhaps he was more lax now because he assumed he was off the radar. An almost unknown and undetected magical force, a covert dark lord with his sleeper cell of followers. He likely trusted Malfoy to keep the library locked. After all, he’d entrusted Lucius Malfoy with the journal, hadn't he? Perhaps he’d even entrusted the diary to Abraxas’ care at some point, only to have it passed down to Lucius.</p><p>Hermione swallowed. She hoped he wouldn’t notice the transfigured horcrux. But somehow, she trusted that even if he knew she’d stolen it… he wouldn’t be angry at her.</p><p>When had she begun to trust him? It was strange to think that he wouldn’t place the safety of his horcruxes above her own welfare.</p><p>Hermione sighed, and flicked her eyes to the horcrux. How was it possible that part of the soul of the man she’d fallen in love with was encased in that journal. That piece of soul had possessed her friend, reopened the chamber of secrets, tried to kill Harry, <em> hated </em> mudbloods, like her.</p><p>She couldn’t reconcile it. </p><p>How could he be so evil and charming simultaneously? The Tom Riddle that Hermione knew had depth. He <em> inspired </em> her. But more than that… he was so <em> human </em>. There was a humility and a rawness to Tom that Hermione had not expected.</p><p>Seductive. That’s what he was. No wonder he’d amassed such devoted followers in the future.</p><p>She wondered how the journal would interact with her. Hermione knew that she shouldn’t write in it. She should pack it away somewhere, hidden, where he couldn’t find it. She didn’t put it past him not to break into her flat if he suspected she’d stolen it. Could he feel his own horcruxes, as Harry had been able to? </p><p>Hermione’s eyes flicked back to the journal. She really should kill that basilisk. </p><p>She contemplated the fallout. If she killed the basilisk now, would the diary horcrux have still been destroyed in the future? Would they have discovered that basilisk venom destroys horcruxes? If she killed it now, the sword wouldn’t be impregnated with the venom.</p><p>If she killed it now, it would be up to <em> her </em> to destroy the horcruxes.</p><p>Hermione’s eyes fell shut. Then her head fell into her hands.</p><p>
<em> Love. I love him. </em>
</p><p>She was no better than Bellatrix Lestrange.</p><p>She might as well take the dark mark now, because she was fucking pathetic.</p><p>
<em> I can’t do it. I can’t destroy it. </em>
</p><p>She grit her teeth and flipped open the journal.</p><p align="left"> </p><hr/><p><br/>
Tom walked into Borgin and Burkes and waved his wand, flipping the closed sign to open. His employer had gone to a wizarding auction in order to locate more magical artifacts, so Tom would be in the shop alone today. It was still early, so there were no customers yet.</p><p>He sighed and tossed the two journals onto the clerk’s desk. It had been three days since Hermione had taken his journal and left a transfigured copy in the stack which Abraxas had delivered to him immediately after Hermione left, as Tom had instructed.</p><p>Since then, Tom had kept his duplicate journal on him at all times, but the witch had yet to write to him. He was sure that he’d cast the charm correctly. </p><p>Tom still wasn’t sure if she knew precisely what the journal was. If she knew about his horcruxes, she’d been extremely secretive about it. Perhaps she’d simply taken the journal, thinking it held his private thoughts. It was entirely possible that she’d assumed he had placed a disappearing charm on his journal entries and thought to explore his own inner monologue. It didn’t seem like something Hermione would do, as she’d always been very respectful of his privacy, but perhaps whatever wrongs he’d committed in the future had influenced her decision making. Perhaps she didn’t trust him, and thought to understand his motivations.</p><p>Still, he carried the journal with him everywhere, hoping that she would write in it. </p><p>He’d been rather busy the past three days, so he hadn’t had a chance to examine the transfigured copy she left behind. He picked it up and smirked, admiring her transfiguration skills. It was a nearly perfect replica, indistinguishable from the journal he’d left. </p><p><em> Sorry to undo your beautiful work, little witch </em>.</p><p>He lifted his wand and cast the counter  of the transfiguration spell, effectively reversing its magic.</p><p>Tom’s eyebrows shot up.</p><p>He held in his hand a purple and green book, bearing a framed photo of what appeared to be a much, much older Albus Dumbledore. The wizard's beard was longer and grayer, his face beset with more lines. </p><p><em> The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore by Rita Skeeter </em>.</p><p>Had Hermione meant for him to find this?</p><p>He opened the book and checked the publication date. </p><p>1997.</p><p>He began to flip through its pages, marveling at the amount of detail regarding the life of Albus Dumbledore.</p><p>Tom swallowed, realizing he held something very valuable in his hands. </p><p>Tom looked around the shop, and as there were no customers and no new artifacts to stock in, he took a seat on the stool behind the desk and began to read.</p><p align="left"> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Tom sped through the prologue and the first chapter, and he was suddenly hit with a wave of sobering realization. </p><p>Dumbledore was dead at the time of publication.</p><p>There were terms he didn’t recognize. </p><p>First and Second Wizarding War.</p><p>There were terms he did recognize.</p><p>Death Eaters. <em> Voldemort </em>.</p><p>He was mentioned, although it appeared from what he could glean that the writer of the book was rather biased against Dumbledore.</p><p>Voldemort’s name was mentioned rather matter-of-factly, as if it were common knowledge. There weren’t enough details for Tom to discern what his role had been… only that he was referred to as the Dark Lord. Not a dark lord, but <em> the </em> Dark Lord. </p><p>He liked that.</p><p>As he began to move onto the second chapter, which examined Albus’ early life, he noticed something.</p><p>The diary replica had begun to glow blue.</p><p>She had written in it. </p><p>His lips curled into a sinister grin, and he flipped open the journal.</p><p>He blinked as he stared at the page.</p><p><em> I hate you </em>.</p><p>Tom’s brows furrowed. He knew that he should respond quickly, but he couldn’t determine if she knew what he’d done, and was calling him out for it… or if she knew she was communicating with a piece of his soul.</p><p>He swallowed, and began to write back.</p><p>
<em> I don’t believe we have met. My name is Tom Riddle. What’s yours? </em>
</p><p>A few moments went by. Tom waited, holding his breath.</p><p>Then, her response materialized.</p><p><em> Oh, we’ve met alright. I cannot bloody get away from you </em>.</p><p>Tom smirked, cocking his head in an amused sort of confusion.</p><p>He wrote back, taking care to act as the journal version of himself, <em> I don’t quite understand. Can you explain how we know each other? </em></p><p>He waited. Minutes went by. </p><p>He ran his tongue over his top teeth. He was beginning to wonder if he’d done something wrong, or if perhaps she knew it was him on the other end and was simply toying with him, when her words slowly appeared on the page.</p><p><em> I don’t have to explain anything to you, you manipulative bastard </em>.</p><p>Tom cocked a brow, tilting his head. </p><p>This witch was one confusing female.</p><p>He decided to take a diplomatic approach. </p><p>
<em> You’re right. You don’t have to explain. I was simply trying to get to know you, but since you clearly hold me in such low esteem, as I’ve surmised you’ve obviously met me before, then I suppose this conversation is at an end. Good luck to you. </em>
</p><p>Tom sighed, hoping she would take the bait.</p><p>He didn’t have to wait long. Her diatribe began quickly and angrily.</p><p>
<em> Don’t act so smug and innocent. You possessed my friend. You killed my other friend’s parents. Your followers tortured and killed another friend’s parents. You and your bloody followers killed my friends and nearly ruined my life. I thought I was finally rid of you. But your fucking object sent me here and now my life is ruined all over again because I can’t kill you and now you’ll do it all over again.  </em>
</p><p>Tom’s heart nearly stopped as he read her message.</p><p>His mouth went dry.</p><p>So she <em> had </em> used the Tempaestus. </p><p>But he’d already suspected that.</p><p>He was still processing her words when another message appeared.</p><p><em> I should kill your fucking basilisk too </em> , <em> you snakey son of a bitch. </em></p><p>The hatred was tangible in her writing, her letters penned quickly, appearing much sharper and spikier than her usual graceful handwriting.</p><p>“Such language from the Witch of the Year. Tsk tsk,” he muttered. </p><p>He wrote back, willing himself to be calm although he was rather alarmed by her words.</p><p>
<em> It seems you know more about me in the future than I do. May I ask what year you are currently living in? I’m afraid being trapped in this journal has left me woefully ignorant of current events. </em>
</p><p>She wrote back quickly. </p><p><em> I know your game. You act polite and charming and then you possess people. I don’t have to tell you anything. I only hoped you’d make me angry enough that I’d want to kill the basilisk and destroy you </em>.</p><p>Tom’s heart was pounding. </p><p>She knew about the basilisk. He should’ve known that already, truth be told. They’d had conversations about magical creatures and she’d been abnormally  informed on the basilisk’s origins.</p><p>Still, he had not anticipated that she would unleash on him like this.</p><p>She was always so cunning and secretive around him.</p><p>She must truly believe she was speaking with his journal.</p><p>Clearly, she knew much more than she’d ever let on. He couldn’t decide whether he was angry or afraid. This was a turn of events he did not expect.</p><p>Tom dipped his quill and wrote back.</p><p>
<em> I’m sorry. I don’t want to make you angry. Will you at least tell me your name? </em>
</p><p>He waited, and her response came a moment later.</p><p>
<em> No. </em>
</p><p>Tom shook his head, his lips twisting into a smirk, then penned a response. </p><p>
<em> Very well. It’s nice to meet you, No. </em>
</p><p>After a few moments, her response materialized on the page.</p><p>
<em> It’s Hermione, you sarcastic sod, and that joke was almost as cheesy as a journal horcrux. Of all the objects you could use, a journal? How very teenage girl of you. </em>
</p><p align="left">Tom’s eyes grew wide. So, at last, he realized that she definitely knew about his horcruxes.</p><p>How was that possible?</p><p>He’d been so careful. </p><p>But then again… clearly he’d made many mistakes in the future.</p><p>His ego severely bruised, he choked back his frustration to write back. </p><p>
<em> Horcrux? I’m not familiar with the term. </em>
</p><p align="left">Her response came swiftly.</p><p>
<em> Oh? So you didn’t ask Slughorn about them in fifth year? My mistake. It must have been another manipulative, handsome asshole who found Secrets of the Darkest Art in the restricted section. </em>
</p><p>Tom froze, his jaw muscles tensing as he gritted his teeth.</p><p>So! His little witch knew nearly everything. What a cunning, crafty woman she was. Though he knew he should be angry, he found himself more impressed than anything.</p><p>Tom was a natural legilimens. The fact that she had hidden all of this information from him, as closely as they’d grown over the course of the year, was remarkable.</p><p>As powerful and sharp as she was, she would make such an incredible counterpart.</p><p>If he could only convince her to let go of her hate and fear of him, if he could somehow earn her trust again, they could be an indestructible force together.</p><p>He felt a sharp pang of longing.</p><p>Her venomous onslaught was only serving to whet his appetite because finally, she was being truthful.</p><p>If he could confront her with these truths, perhaps they could move past them. </p><p>Suddenly it occurred to him that she would be quite angry if she knew that he’d tricked her.</p><p><em> May I ask how you came to know about my basilisk and horcruxes, then </em> ? <em> You are apparently too cunning of a witch to fool, although presumably you are aware that horcruxes are made with very dark magic, so I question if it was a wise decision to alert me to the depth of your knowledge. However, since there are no longer any pretenses between us, will you tell me why it is that you feel you cannot destroy me? You’ve piqued my curiosity, Hermione. </em></p><p>Tom penned his reply and looked through the window to see the streets begin to be filled with shoppers. With a flick of his wand, he dimmed the lights in the shop and flipped the open sign to closed.</p><p align="left">This was more important, he decided.</p><p>Minutes went by before her response slowly manifested on the page, letter by letter.</p><p><em> Because I fell in love with you, like all the rest of your pathetic followers. It’s ironic, isn’t it? How the whole world loved you, a man incapable of love… and in return, you tried to burn the world down. It’s quite tragic, really </em>. </p><p align="left">Tom read her reply several times, trying to comprehend. </p><p>Incapable of love? Did she truly believe that about him?</p><p>After he’d told her how he felt? After he’d shown her in so many ways?</p><p>He scrawled a swift reply.</p><p><em> Who told you I was incapable of love </em>?</p><p>A moment later, her words appeared in the journal.</p><p>
<em> How could you not be? You’ve never experienced love yourself. </em>
</p><p>Then, another message appeared. </p><p>
<em> No one capable of love could do the things you’ve done, Voldemort. </em>
</p><p>Tom took a deep breath. He understood why she felt the way she did. It only made sense, and he was nothing if not logical.</p><p>But it still hurt.</p><p>Because love her, he most certainly did. </p><p>Fiercely.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Tom heard Hermione’s words echoing in his head.</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>I love you too, Tom. But I won’t be controlled by you.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">He recalled her words in the journal. They scrolled back and forth like a marquee behind his eyes.</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>I hate you.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>Incapable of love.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>You killed my friends.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>No one capable of love would do the things you’ve done.</em>
</p><p>Tom gritted his teeth.</p><p dir="ltr">The issue was that he was trying.</p><p dir="ltr">But it wasn’t enough. Because something must be wrong with him.</p><p>He’d never thought that way before. He’d been thoroughly convinced that something was wrong with the rest of society… that they lacked ambition and drive. They lacked conviction and commitment to their purposes.</p><p dir="ltr">But he was beginning to realize he had caused pain.</p><p dir="ltr">He saw it from afar, in a detached way. As if he were staring from an aerial perspective, into a snow globe at a city that was burning. Tip it over and the ash flies around and flutters to the ground.</p><p dir="ltr">He’d caused it, but he had no emotional attachment to it.</p><p dir="ltr">He did, however, have an emotional attachment to Hermione.</p><p dir="ltr">Her pain made him sick. To think that he’d caused it… that there might be irreparable damage done to her life and heart as a result of his actions…</p><p dir="ltr">He suddenly felt like an orphan again. Unsure of himself.</p><p dir="ltr">He remembered when he first arrived at Hogwarts. He’d been ridiculed for everything under the sun. For his shabby robes. For the orphanage where he’d</p><p dir="ltr"> grown up. For his muggle habits. For his thievery. He was called a mudblood, particularly by his own housemates. He was treated as lower than dirt at Hogwarts until he’d discovered his maternal lineage. Edward Rosier had been his first friend, and he’d been the first person Tom told…</p><p dir="ltr">… that he was the heir of Salazar Slytherin.</p><p dir="ltr">Slowly, one by one, they each came around.</p><p dir="ltr">Before, they had hated him for his magical prowess. </p><p dir="ltr">After, they said it was only fitting. He was the heir of Salazar Slytherin, after all, one of the greatest wizards to ever live.</p><p dir="ltr">Tom had told them to keep it quiet.</p><p dir="ltr">Truthfully, it had gone to his head a bit.</p><p dir="ltr">He’d gone from a contemptible orphan to the celebrity of Slytherin House overnight.</p><p dir="ltr">It hadn’t been enough for him. When he discovered the legend about the Chamber of Secrets, Tom dedicated his time to finding it.</p><p dir="ltr">He’d spent night after night, dreaming about what the monster could be.</p><p dir="ltr">Then, he learned about Herpo the Foul. The curriculum was rather dull and barely skimmed the surface of the dark wizard’s life, so Tom volunteered at the library in order to gain access to the restricted section.</p><p dir="ltr">There, he found Secrets of the Darkest Art, and the Tales of Dark Wizards. It was then that he learned about horcruxes, and Herpo’s basilisk. When he discovered that both Slytherin and Herpo could speak to snakes, a genetic trait, he knew then that he was descended from them both. </p><p dir="ltr">Then he surmised the monster was a basilisk.</p><p dir="ltr">After that, it was all too easy to locate the chamber… which is just as Salazar had intended it.</p><p dir="ltr">Only a parselmouth could find it. Only a parselmouth could open it. </p><p dir="ltr">He’d walked through the corridors at night.</p><p dir="ltr">“Where are you?” he hissed.</p><p dir="ltr">He’d heard nothing for the first few nights. He kept a map of the castle, crossing off the corridors one by one.</p><p dir="ltr">Finally, as he passed by the girl’s lavatory one evening, he heard it.</p><p dir="ltr">“Let me out,” it hissed. “Kill… kill… I smell their filthy blood.”</p><p dir="ltr">Tom had snuck into the girl’s lavatory and the snake’s hisses grew louder. </p><p dir="ltr">“Who are you?” Tom asked in parseltongue.</p><p dir="ltr">The hissing paused.</p><p dir="ltr">After a moment, he heard the serpent answer, “I am his, who built my home… and I am yours, who bears his blood.”</p><p dir="ltr">“You are very old, then,” Tom replied.</p><p dir="ltr">“Old, yes. Ancient,” the creature hissed. “I come from the ancient world. I was brought here as a hatchling, from the castle of Salazar Slytherin, my master. He transported me from the kingdom of Mercia, during the days of mudblood King Aethelred the Unready. I have lived beneath these halls for a thousand years.” </p><p dir="ltr">The serpent paused. “Many masters have come before you, but only you have sought me. Is your name Gaunt, like the others?”</p><p dir="ltr">Tom’s brows furrowed, as he’d begun to search for any way to access the creature, but there seemed to be no entrance or hidden passages. “No,” he murmured.</p><p dir="ltr">“You are not like the others. You are not afraid of me.”</p><p dir="ltr">Tom swallowed. That was debatable. “Show me yourself.”</p><p dir="ltr">The serpent paused and let out a sinister hiss, which caused Tom’s skin to crawl. “You must open the chamber, young Master.” </p><p dir="ltr">“How shall I do it?”</p><p dir="ltr">The serpent hissed. “Command it… to be opened.”</p><p dir="ltr">Tom started to speak, but then held his tongue. </p><p dir="ltr">He thought long and hard, and then replied, “You answer to me, do you not? You will obey my commands?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Yessss, Master.”</p><p dir="ltr">Tom’s jaw tensed. “If I look into your eyes, I will be petrified. Turned to stone, is that correct?”</p><p dir="ltr">The serpent hissed. “I shall close my eyes, Master. Lead me along with your hands. I will guide you into the chamber. I know it by heart, after all these years. I do not need my eyesight. It is failing me. It is quite dark in these pipes, and I have gone nearly blind. I can still smell them, though… the filthy ones.”</p><p dir="ltr">Tom’s heart pounded, somewhat afraid of what opening the chamber would reveal. “If I open the chamber, you will not come out into the school until I command. Agreed? Only take me into the chamber this time. If you obey, I will come to see you again.”</p><p dir="ltr">“I agree, young Master.”</p><p dir="ltr">Tom spoke the words, and the chamber opened, revealing a passageway which led beneath the sinks.</p><p dir="ltr">He was hypnotized by the genius of Slytherin.</p><p dir="ltr">He looked into the blackness, and then disappeared below.</p><p dir="ltr">In the darkness, he heard the labored breathing of the serpent. He held out his hand, and he felt the roughness of its scales against his palm.</p><p dir="ltr">The serpent began to move, guiding him down into the chamber. </p><p dir="ltr">At length, Tom began to see lights.</p><p dir="ltr">Mammoth columns, entwined by carved wood. Snakewood, the same wood which Slytherin’s wand had been made from. </p><p>Then, torches bearing green fire lit the corridor, and the Basilisk became visible. Though Tom Riddle was tall, this serpent was twice his height and its length disappeared back into the darkness. Its eyes were closed, so Tom examined it, finding that its head alone was enormous. </p><p dir="ltr">Reading about the Basilisk was one thing.</p><p dir="ltr">Seeing it with his very eyes was entirely another.</p><p dir="ltr">His heart raced and his throat went dry as he ran his hand along its scales, feeling its wall of thick, cold skin. The muscles and flesh beneath its scales spasmed, flexing everywhere his hand touched.</p><p dir="ltr">Thick horns and strange knobs rose from the ridges on its nose and head. Little bony wings jutted out from where the holes of its ears were.</p><p dir="ltr">But its mouth…</p><p dir="ltr">Razor sharp teeth jutted out from its jaw, massive fangs, like knives glistening with venom.</p><p dir="ltr">Tom gulped.</p><p>The snake began to speak again, but when its forked tongue shot out from between its myriad of teeth, it seemed to be nearly ten feet long.</p><p dir="ltr">Tom jumped back on instinct, but the snake turned its head, eyes still closed. </p><p dir="ltr">“There is no need to be afraid, young master. I mean you no harm.” The serpent slithered closer, and Tom reined in his terror to remain fixed. “I have not been touched by a wizard since my Master fell into the abyss of the night.”</p><p dir="ltr">Tom’s heart pounded as he laid his hand along the creature's side. It hissed happily.</p><p dir="ltr">He followed along at the creature’s side until they reached what appeared to be the chamber itself. It was brighter, lit by torches of green and yellow flames. He saw that the creature’s scales were black, but gleamed with an iridescence that appeared to be green at times. </p><p dir="ltr">Tom’s feet were drenched in a pool of water.</p><p dir="ltr">He looked up to find a vast statue of Slytherin himself, which the serpent slithered forth to enter into before returning back through the mouth of the effigy. </p><p dir="ltr">Like a tongue… </p><p dir="ltr">Tom marveled at the elaborate chamber.</p><p dir="ltr">“Are you… male or female?” he asked the serpent.</p><p dir="ltr">“This question I do not know. I do not know what I am,” the snake replied. </p><p dir="ltr">Tom tilted his head. “Fair enough.”</p><p dir="ltr">He spent several months visiting the chamber, exploring it, searching its various nooks and crannies, hoping to find something left behind by Slytherin, perhaps a spellbook or a letter for his heir, but there was nothing.</p><p dir="ltr">So he spoke with his Basilisk.</p><p dir="ltr">He asked the serpent to tell him about Salazar Slytherin. </p><p dir="ltr">The snake did have some interesting stories regarding the wizard, but was unfortunately, only a snake, and it had been nearly a thousand years, and so the creature could remember very little useful information. For example, the snake couldn’t recall any magic or spells that Slytherin had performed. Only little stories of the visits its Master made, or their journey across the British isles together. Apparently, Slytherin had also mastered distant apparation and unsupported flight. Slytherin had been obsessed with Merlin, apparently, and had possessed many of the Druid’s magical artifacts. </p><p dir="ltr">“There was a necklace my Master always wore. I do not know the word for it… it opened. It bore a green stone. The metal it was forged from was made from the same metal as Excalibur. A prized possession of my Master.”</p><p dir="ltr">“It opened, you say? A locket, perhaps?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Perhaps.”</p><p dir="ltr">Tom spoke so often with the serpent that he nearly began speaking parseltongue in his classes by accident.</p><p>One day, Tom had climbed the stone effigy of Slytherin and was sitting atop it, gazing down over the chamber. This was the place he felt best. It was an escape for him. Soon, he would release his Basilisk to perform Slytherin’s work.</p><p dir="ltr">He sat in the chamber that night, reading Secrets of the Darkest Art, when he asked his Basilisk, “Did your Master ever create an object called a horcrux?”</p><p dir="ltr">The snake hissed. “That word… I have not heard that word in many many centuries.”</p><p dir="ltr">Tom perked up. “Did Slytherin make one?”</p><p dir="ltr">The serpent was quiet. Then he spoke. “This was a very bad thing, my Master despised. A dark magic he would not perform.” The snake struggled to pronounce the word, as there was no equivalent in parseltongue. “Haer-crukssss.”</p><p dir="ltr">“But he wasn’t averse to murder… He did train you to kill, after all.”</p><p>“This… haer-crukssss… an ancient wizard used this magic, and his soul became lost. My Master did not desire such a fate.”</p><p dir="ltr">Tom’s brows furrowed. Was he referring to Herpo the Foul? Very likely. It was true that the ancient wizard had created a horcrux, but what had become of his soul? No one knew. It was never recorded. Someone would have had to bring him back after death… That was a tricky aspect about horcruxes… a loose end that grated on Tom’s nerves. </p><p dir="ltr">He wanted to create one, but if Slytherin himself thought it too dangerous…</p><p dir="ltr">But then, who was to say which was more frightening? A soul lost in the spirit world, or the afterlife?</p><p dir="ltr">Tom thought he would rather take his chances. </p><p dir="ltr">He wanted to push the boundaries farther than any dark wizard ever had…</p><p dir="ltr">Even Herpo. </p><p dir="ltr">Even <em>Grindelwald</em>…</p><p dir="ltr">When Tom finally released the basilisk upon the school, he watched with a vicious sort of excitement when students were petrified. </p><p dir="ltr">He thought himself to be some sort of fulfillment of prophecy. The heir which would continue the noble cause of Slytherin himself.</p><p dir="ltr">It gave Tom a sense of self-importance, which was something he’d never truly had.</p><p dir="ltr">He’d watched apathetically when mudbloods around the school were petrified.</p><p dir="ltr">Then, when a girl was killed… Tom hadn’t known how to feel. He’d been waiting for it to happen. </p><p dir="ltr">He’d released the snake.</p><p dir="ltr">It was inevitable.</p><p dir="ltr">But he hadn’t really meant it.</p><p dir="ltr">He’d had no specific target in mind. No emotion behind it.</p><p dir="ltr">He’d felt as far removed emotionally from her death as from the death of his mother.</p><p dir="ltr">But it twisted his gut somehow.</p><p dir="ltr">Because he had no hatred for Myrtle. He truly had no hatred for mudbloods.</p><p dir="ltr">They were not so very different from him, as a half-blood.</p><p dir="ltr">He’d once been treated as one, after all.</p><p dir="ltr">It was merely his vanity which had driven him to release the basilisk.</p><p dir="ltr">Tom wanted murder to mean something. If he was going to commit the act, he wanted it to be a useful thing. Something he could utilize as a stepping stone. </p><p dir="ltr">He convinced himself that her death needed to happen, as meaningless as it might’ve seemed. That mudbloods would all have to die in order to please his powerful allies… the purebloods who had once spurned him.</p><p dir="ltr">Some deeply buried part of Tom wished the basilisk had killed them.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><hr/><p dir="ltr"><br/>Deep in the dungeons of Malfoy Manor, there was an immense vault. Within that vault, innumerable family treasures were kept. There were jewels and magical artefacts, historical relics, and priceless antiquities of bygone centuries.</p><p>Within that vault, there was a strange marble sphere which sat upon a pedestal. The sphere was dark, and in some ways, quite similar to a crystal ball. One could see inside it as if looking through a telescope. Deep within the center of the ghostly sphere was an eye, and within that eye, was a room. If standing beside it, one could barely see the flicker of a fireplace, like the miniscule striking of a match.</p><p dir="ltr">Within this room, which was housed magically inside the eye of the enchanted orb, sat Malfoy, Dolohov, and Walburga Black.</p><p dir="ltr">They sat in the dark room, around an ancient round table carved of Blackwood. Its surface was etched with circular rune patterns and the ancient Greek letters organized in unrecognizable languages, many of which were outdated and had fallen from knowledge with the passage of time. The orb had once belonged to the druid peoples, and there was no knowing from whence they had obtained it.</p><p dir="ltr">“Do you know how long it’s taken me to track this object down?” Malfoy complained. “It cost me a fortune. Just so that we can discuss things we shouldn’t be discussing in the first place.”</p><p dir="ltr">“You have a fortune, Malfoy, and you’ll never be rid of it, so stop whinging,” said Dolohov snidely. “Besides, if you thought we shouldn’t discuss these things, why would you track down the object in the first place?”</p><p dir="ltr">The fireplace crackled unpleasantly, almost seeming to be an entity on its own.</p><p dir="ltr">“Because you fools won’t stop bringing up forbidden topics and I don’t relish getting myself rattled for life by Tom’s cruciatus.” Malfoy cast a leery side eye at Walburga. “As close as we’ve been in the past, Miss Black, I don’t see why your presence here is necessary.”</p><p dir="ltr">“She stays,” muttered Dolohov.</p><p dir="ltr">“She’s not one of us,” Malfoy snapped through gritted teeth.</p><p dir="ltr">“We are not even one of us anymore, are we? How can we trust what is happening?”</p><p dir="ltr">Malfoy glared at Dolohov. “I don’t want to turn against Tom.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Tom is turning against us, Malfoy. Can’t you sense it? Or are you still clinging to some boyhood fantasy? Some version of Tom that has long died? He’s not the skinny orphan we used to know. He’s changed. Dumbledore’s daughter aside… he had changed even before that, and you know it. It’s his way or nothing. The Dark Lord… and we’ve been in the process of becoming servants for a while. It used to be about us… all of us. Now it’s about him. Only him. Do you know why he had talked of leaving? Traveling? He wanted to put distance between himself and all of us. He wanted to learn things that we couldn’t. Put himself above us.”</p><p dir="ltr">Malfoy slammed his hand on the table, an action which should’ve made the others jump. Dolohov flinched, but Walburga sat still as a statue. Malfoy wondered if she’d ever been struck before, as collected as she seemed. “He has to be above us, Max! How else would we be able to accomplish our ends? We cannot do it on our own, and Tom has the determination and frankly, the power, to do what needs to be done for the good of all of us. We do not have that gift. Tom does. He is a prodigy, and if we must follow behind him instead of alongside him, then so be it. We have no other choice. He deserves our service, and we should render it gladly, as we vowed.”</p><p dir="ltr">Dolohov scoffed, and even Walburga gazed at Abraxas disdainfully. “How can you say that? Now, after everything he’s said? He’s not the same. The witch has changed him.” He picked at his nails absently. “Unless of course, you’re still pining after him.”</p><p dir="ltr">Abraxas sat glowering at him coldly, then cut his eyes toward Walburga.</p><p dir="ltr">She was wisely silent. </p><p dir="ltr">“We took his mark, Max.”</p><p dir="ltr">Dolohov scowled and ripped his sleeve up to show his mark to Malfoy. Walburga stared at it without emotion.</p><p dir="ltr">“Look at it. It’s the mark of Slytherin,” whispered Dolohov, his chocolate brown eyes gleaming intently.</p><p dir="ltr">“Tom is his heir.”</p><p dir="ltr">“And yet,” said Dolohov, the firelight dancing on the planes of his face, “Slytherin believed that magic is might. He believed wizarding blood must be kept pure. Tom thinks he can correct even Salazar himself. His head is full to bursting. Would you have your legacy destroyed? Next, he’ll be bringing mudbloods into our fold. He will have us sitting side by side with them at meetings. He will have them take the mark.”</p><p>Malfoy swallowed, gazing into the flames. </p><p dir="ltr">Dolohov stared at him intensely.</p><p dir="ltr">Walburga’s cerulean eyes watched them both with detached interest.</p><p dir="ltr">At length, Malfoy spoke. “Tom could kill us all… and he could do it in his sleep, Max.”</p><p dir="ltr">Max’s eyes glittered, reflecting the flicker of the ancient flames. “Perhaps we might enlist the aid of Minister Tuft. He can’t kill us all without landing his arse in Azkaban.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Azkaban cannot hold him, Max.” Malfoy looked disturbed, and lowered his voice. “The dementors do not even affect him. They do not seem to even see him. It’s… unnatural.”</p><p>Walburga’s eyebrows furrowed at that.</p><p dir="ltr">“This little stunt we are about to pull could likely land us in Azkaban, Abraxas.”</p><p dir="ltr">Malfoy shook his head. “No… There’s no chance. We have too many powerful friends in the Wizengamot.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Yes, but do they trust Tom enough to side with us?”</p><p dir="ltr">“They trust me. There are many who are disheartened since Grindelwald’s fall. If the right Lord were to arise… they would pledge their allegiance.” Abraxas looked into his eyes, his silver irises contrasted with Dolohov’s. “Tom is that Lord.”</p><p dir="ltr">Dolohov looked away. “I wanted to believe that. I still do. But I’m losing faith, Malfoy.” </p><p dir="ltr">Malfoy sighed, and looked to Walburga. “And what have you to say, Miss Black? Are you here to contribute anything, or will you sit there like a toadstool?”</p><p dir="ltr">Walburga’s eyes were icy. “You play an aristocrat much better than you play a Death Eater, Abraxas.”</p><p dir="ltr">Malfoy’s stare was sinister. “You played Riddle’s whore much better than you play Orion’s doting fiancée.”</p><p dir="ltr">Dolohov whipped out his wand before Malfoy could react.</p><p dir="ltr">Walburga’s full lips curved into a smile, and she laughed. “Are you angry because you couldn’t be his whore, Brax?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Curse me and you’ll never get out of this blasted orb,” Malfoy gritted to Dolohov, ignoring Walburga’s jibe.</p><p dir="ltr">“Then watch your tongue.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Are you his witch now, Walburga?” Abraxas asked with barely concealed amusement.</p><p dir="ltr">“I don’t belong to anyone. I shouldn’t have to be a man’s possession in order for him to enforce basic respect.” Her lips quirked. “But it seems you all have not grown out of your misogynistic ways since Hogwarts.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Perhaps when you begin to have respect for yourself,” Malfoy sneered, “Then we will have-“</p><p dir="ltr">“Enough!” Walburga hissed, drawing both their eyes. “We are here to discuss Hermione Dumbledore, are we not? Not Tom. The issue is, she has twisted his mind.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Why do you care?” asked Malfoy.</p><p dir="ltr">“Because Dolohov is bound to him and Orion is considering joining up and taking the mark. Before my future husband pledges his  allegiance, we must be certain that Tom will uphold our standards. He made certain promises during sixth year. He’s coveted Orion ever since.”</p><p dir="ltr">Malfoy smirked. “So you won’t marry Dolohov, then?”</p><p dir="ltr">Walburga’s eyes were as frigid as the very iceberg that sank the titanic. “Orion has his own distractions. I shall have mine.”</p><p dir="ltr">“You mean he’s still entertaining himself with other wizards, then?”</p><p dir="ltr">Walburga’s eyes narrowed. “When did you become so prickly, Malfoy?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Since you two threatened the order of things.”</p><p dir="ltr">“You were angry just as I was,” interjected Dolohov. “When Tom tossed those scrolls on the table.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Yes, but Tom will come back around-“</p><p dir="ltr">“When Hermione Dumbledore is dead.” </p><p dir="ltr">The room was filled with stark silence, like drops of dark blood on a white floor.</p><p dir="ltr">“He will kill you.”</p><p dir="ltr">“He doesn’t have to know.”</p><p dir="ltr">“You’re sure this object works?” Walburga queried, looking around at the room. “It’s an awful big risk if it doesn’t.”</p><p dir="ltr">“It works. I’ve already tested it.”</p><p dir="ltr">“How exactly does it work?” asked Dolohov as he tapped his fingertips with their well-manicured nails along the runes on the table. </p><p dir="ltr">“Our magical ancestors, the Druids, were lorekeepers, philosophers, and sorcerers, but they left no written accounts, as you know. It was long believed that their knowledge and literature was passed down orally. Many believe that the priests relayed their lore and spells via legilimency, their doctrine preventing them from keeping written records. It is said that a sect of druids were taught a very nasty form of divination by a Gaulic dark wizard… they would prepare a human sacrifice, plunging a blade into its chest. By observing the way the corpse died, how its blood spilt, how its limbs flailed… they would be able to discern the future.” Malfoy ran his fingers over the markings on the table. “In order to hide their rituals from the pious muggles, they unearthed these objects from the ancient world. This artefact is now called a Druidic eye by scholars, but it is believed to date back to the lEgyptian magicians. Essentially, whatever is discussed within the eye, becomes trapped, and cannot be accessed by any form of magic. You will recall this conversation distantly, but neither legilimency nor obliviation will work on the memory. It is permanently trapped within the eye, and can only be retrieved by the memory’s keeper.” </p><p dir="ltr">Dolohov’s lips quirked. “I wonder how many ghastly deeds have been confessed within this room.”</p><p dir="ltr">Walburga ran a long, maroon nail along the carvings. “Let’s hope there will be even more… because Hermione Dumbledore needs to die a slow death.”</p><p dir="ltr">Dolohov turned his gaze on her, his dark brown eyes flickering with heat. “We could bring her here… trap her in this orb. Her blood could stain these stone floors for generations to come.”</p><p dir="ltr">Walburga’s lips curled.</p><p>“Perhaps she needn’t die,” Malfoy sighed. “A little intimidation could go a long way.”</p><p dir="ltr">“No,” muttered Dolohov. “Not this one. The only way to stop her is to strangle the air from her lungs.”</p><p dir="ltr">“She’s not all that bad. I’m sure she thinks she’s doing something quite noble, as misguided as her notions are,” said Malfoy sullenly.</p><p dir="ltr">“It doesn’t matter, Abraxas. It’s the influence she has over Tom that will be the death of her.”</p><p dir="ltr">“But are you quite sure Hermione is the cause? I have seen no hint of their being in a relationship. Perhaps what you saw that morning was a-“</p><p dir="ltr">“We either kill Hermione, or we kill Tom.” Dolohov pointed to his arm where the mark lay. “Without her politics poisoning his mind, he could come back around. Otherwise, there is no way to do away with these marks other than to do away with their creator.”</p><p>“Do you really think Tom is that simpleminded? He’s the smartest wizard I know. He’s been with us for years… and in all that time, I’ve never known him to let a bit of skirt addle his brain.” He cast a furtive glance at Walburga. </p><p dir="ltr">Dolohov leaned forward and gripped Malfoy’s shoulder. “I think Hermione is a dangerous witch, and for some reason, she’s set her sights on Tom. Not to mention, she’s the talk of London and you know what they’re saying? They’re saying it might not be Tuft’s son for Minister next, but Hermione.”</p><p dir="ltr">Walburga wrinkled her nose in distaste.</p><p>Dolohov looked at Malfoy. “Can you imagine the damage she could do if she were elected? I can’t imagine what would be worse, besides maybe a mudblood.” He gave Malfoy a pointed look. “And you know they’re talking about that, too. We need to get Tom back on track. Then we can take back control.”</p><p dir="ltr">“What you’re suggesting that we do is incredibly dangerous. Not only because Tom might become suspicious  and kill us all, but because if he doesn’t, Dumbledore will.”</p><p dir="ltr">“That’s why we must be extremely careful.” Dolohov rubbed his chin thoughtfully. “Burgs had a thought that I found… interesting.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Pillow talk, I presume?” Malfoy sneered.</p><p dir="ltr">“What if we discredit Hermione Dumbledore?” asked Walburga.</p><p dir="ltr">Malfoy blinked. “Discredit?”</p><p>“What if she’s hiding something? Max has tried to dredge up her past, but he found every trail conveniently cut short. He couldn’t find much about her before she showed up in London. All the old biddies in Edinburgh have poignant stories about her childhood... and that’s all. Something isn’t right.”</p><p dir="ltr">“You went to Edinburgh? You fool.”</p><p dir="ltr">“She’s right. Something isn’t right and I have a feeling the only way to find the truth is to get inside the witch’s head.”</p><p dir="ltr">“This is too dangerous,” Malfoy muttered. “What of the others? Will you convince everyone of your foolhardy plans?”</p><p dir="ltr">“We can try. Lestrange is with me. The rest… I was hoping you’d speak to them.”</p><p dir="ltr">“What about Tom? What happens when he discovers what you’ve done?”</p><p dir="ltr">“If we do it right, he won’t. And if he does… then we will have to kill him. We will have to kill him anyway, if Hermione Dumbledore lives.”</p><p dir="ltr">“This is all quite dramatic.”</p><p dir="ltr">“You knew once we took the mark that we were in it for life. If Tom changes course, where does that land us?” He and Malfoy locked eyes. “If we don’t kill him, he will kill us.”</p><p dir="ltr">Malfoy gulped thickly. “I don’t think we can kill him.”</p><p dir="ltr">Dolohov’s eyes narrowed. “I know he’s powerful… but with the element of surprise-“</p><p dir="ltr">“No,” Malfoy interrupted. “I mean… he’s talked of immortality.”</p><p dir="ltr">Walburga’s eyes grew big. “Immortality?”</p><p dir="ltr">They exchanged glances. Malfoy took a deep breath. “I don’t think it’s something he wants known. But I think he’s done something… his eyes-“</p><p dir="ltr">“That’s… terrifying.”</p><p>Malfoy nodded, his silver eyes alive with fear. “Which is only another reason why we must tread very, very carefully.”</p><p dir="ltr">Dolohov gazed at him intently. “Will you speak to the others?”</p><p dir="ltr">He pursed his lips in annoyance. “I would have to bring them here.”</p><p dir="ltr">Dolohov nodded.</p><p dir="ltr">“You really believe there’s no simple parting of ways with Tom?”</p><p dir="ltr">Dolohov shook his head. “Even if that were possible… as powerful as Tom is, do you want him on their side? The mudbloods? Do we really need another Dumbledore?”</p><p dir="ltr">Malfoy scoffed. “Tom is hardly another Dumbledore. He hates Dumbledore. In fact, we aren’t even sure he’s being influenced by Hermione. What if you do away with the witch, and nothing changes? What will you do if he truly cannot be killed?”</p><p dir="ltr">Dolohov was silent. Walburga watched him pensively.</p><p dir="ltr">Malfoy stood. “Food for thought,” he muttered, then began to tap his wand to several of the runes and letters of the alphabet. Each carving glowed with the touch of his wand. </p><p>Then, in a brilliant flash of light, they disappeared. The fire sputtered and crackled menacingly in their wake.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p dir="ltr">Hermione sat in the office of her lawyer, Starling Sylvanox. Across from her, over a coffee table spread with tea and biscuits, sat Monty and Euphemia Potter beside the heir of Portsmouth Potions, Tobias Haywood.</p><p dir="ltr">“Mr. Haywood,” Hermione began. “Thank you for granting me this meeting today.” She glanced at the Potters. The fashionable couple was beaming. “I appreciate your help in connecting me with the Haywoods. I have an interest in purchasing your property, which was formerly known as Portsmouth Potions. Have you any interest in selling it?”</p><p dir="ltr">Tobias was a tall, strapping young man who looked to be around thirty years old. He had leaf green eyes and pale blonde hair which grew just past his chin. He ran his hand over the soft stubble on his jaw thoughtfully. “Well…” His brows knit, and he seemed to be torn by her query. “I suppose it would help out our family.”</p><p dir="ltr">Hermione’s brows lifted. She flicked her eyes at Euphemia, and the witch’s expression shifted into one of sympathy. “Tobias and Winnie’s family have been in the potions business for years,” said Euphemia with gentle consternation. “But their father has fallen ill, as I mentioned before.”</p><p dir="ltr">Tobias looked at Hermione with wide, uncertain eyes. “My parents weren’t able to keep the factory running with his illness, and unfortunately I didn’t inherit any skill or love for potionmaking. That’s my sister, Winifred. But… she was too young to be much help at the time. She only just graduated from Hogwarts last year.” He sighed. “I should have sold it sooner, but it was a labor of love, you see. My grandparents and great-grandparents owned the factory, and it’s a bit of a family legacy. I guess I’d been holding onto it for my parents’ sake… they always hoped one day Winnie would pick it up and do something with it.</p><p dir="ltr">“I see,” Hermione replied. “I’m very sorry to hear about your father, Mr. Haywood. I wonder if perhaps I could meet your sister. Maybe you needn’t let go of the factory entirely… Perhaps, if she’s as gifted at potions as you say, I could be a sort of investor.”</p><p dir="ltr">Tobias was frozen for a moment, blinking as he stared at Hermione. “W-what?”</p><p dir="ltr">Hermione bit her lip. “Well, I was hoping to purchase the factory in order to open a newspaper… but I suppose we could work something else out.”</p><p dir="ltr">Tobias sat up in his chair. “There’s ever so much space in the factory, Miss Dumbledore. Have you been inside?”</p><p dir="ltr">Hermione shook her head.</p><p dir="ltr">Sylvanox had an enchanted quill which scratched away in the corner of the room, taking notes of the meeting. He sat in silence, his dark gray hair frosted with ice-colored streaks, garbed in flowing indigo robes, the hems of which were embroidered with the silver threads of Egyptian heiroglyphics. Hermione both liked and disliked him; he was eccentric and reminded her of Dumbledore, and he was unerringly loyal to one thing: galleons. That infusion of personality and crude simplicity made Hermione quite comfortable in his presence. She’d long since given up the need for heroic business partners. She could deal with morally bereft individuals; perhaps she’d learned a thing or two about how the world worked from Tom.</p><p dir="ltr">Not everything was sunshine and daisies in the wizarding world. The political intricacies of the war had taught her that. Hermione no longer trusted easily, and her heart was locked away, her kindness strong and alive but hidden away beneath her occlumency walls.</p><p dir="ltr">Tobias’ bright green eyes lit up. “There are parts of the factory that we never even used. I could take you on a tour of the facilities… I think you could have a paper as well, and still get the factory up and running.”</p><p dir="ltr">The Potters smiled widely and turned their hopeful gazes to Hermione. </p><p dir="ltr">Hermione took a sip of her tea and then asked the young man a serious question. “Is your sister absolutely dedicated to potionmaking?”</p><p dir="ltr">He nodded eagerly. “She’s got her cauldron out every day, Miss Dumbledore. She’s not just skilled at brewing, but she’s a right magical chemist. It’s her dream to reopen the factory.” His face fell a bit. “We just never had the galleons to do it.”</p><p dir="ltr">Hermione rubbed her lips together pensively. “Could you set up a meeting with myself and your sister? I would like to discuss her business plan, and perhaps we could come to an agreement. We could decide on an investment, and perhaps we can be co-owners of the factory.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Miss Dumbledore, if I may interject,” Monty said, breaking in. “I have another brilliant potion in the works, but unfortunately I don’t have time to devote to the manufacturing of it. But all in all, I think this sounds absolutely brilliant, and I’d love to be involved myself, if you’re so inclined.”</p><p dir="ltr">Euphemia piped in as well. “Monty has such an incredible business mind, Hermione. He would be a great asset in getting it off the ground.”</p><p dir="ltr">Hermione smiled widely. “Well, it’s absolutely marvelous, that’s what it is. I’d be happy as a lark if we all could come out on top from such a collaboration.”</p><p dir="ltr">Tobias cleared his throat, obviously biting back tears in his glistening eyes. “I’ll set up a meeting with you and my sister right away, Miss Dumbledore. This would be a huge encouragement to my family.” His eyes fell. “It’s been a rough few years, to say the least.”</p><p dir="ltr">Hermione gave him a soft smile. “I look forward to meeting her.”</p><p dir="ltr">Euphemia clapped her hands, which were clad in trendy, chameleon skin gloves. “I say we <em>all</em> get together. <em>Soon</em>! Whatever terms we come to, Mr. Sylvanox can draft up in writing.” She looked at Hermione. “But you have no idea how thrilled I am to hear you’re starting your own paper! The Daily Prophet has had the monopoly for far too long. Sometimes I hardly trust a word they print. Do you have a name for your newspaper yet?”</p><p dir="ltr">Hermione’s lips curled into a dazzling grin, and she replied, “<em>The Chronomancer</em>.”</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p dir="ltr"><br/>
Tom had finished setting up a display of Haitian voodoo instruments  in the window of Borgin &amp; Burkes when a paper boy dropped off a copy of The Prophet for his employer. Tom took the paper and walked back to the clerks desk, tossing it on its surface. Then he stopped short as he  caught sight of the front cover. His anger flared instantly.</p><p>
<em>Dumbledore and Dufresne… Dating?!</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">There was a covertly snapped photograph of the two of them seated side-by-side in The Three Broomsticks, alone in the dark of the pub.</p><p dir="ltr">They were <em>too close</em>.</p><p dir="ltr">Tom grit his teeth, his hand flexing with the subconscious urge to curse Dufresne.</p><p dir="ltr">Tom’s heart beat violently, possessiveness washing over him in red-painted fury.</p><p dir="ltr">He forced himself to breathe steadily. In and out.</p><p><em>Mine</em>.</p><p dir="ltr">His compulsions were swiftly taking over, but he counted to ten in his head, which was one of his methods of trying to control them.</p><p>He wanted Dufresne dead.</p><p>His rational side told him that there was a possibility that nothing was going on between the two of them. They were co-workers, after all, and the papers had always claimed Hermione was romantically linked with various wizards based on artfully timed photographs, even while she was in Tom’s bed every night.</p><p dir="ltr">But with their separation, Tom was growing more and more frustrated.</p><p>He wasn’t worried about the rest of them. </p><p dir="ltr">But Dufresne…</p><p dir="ltr">Tom hadn’t liked the way he looked at Hermione at the inaugural ball.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite that, Tom had learned his lesson when it came to his little witch. She did not appreciate Tom’s interference, and to take action against another of Hermione’s employers would only drive her further from him.</p><p dir="ltr">That, Tom could not stomach.</p><p dir="ltr">He took a deep breath, then swallowed thickly. His every thought was consumed by her… this infuriating witch with the butterscotch eyes and mocking laughter. She was so intelligent and enterprising… so vindictive and yet soft-hearted all at once. Hermione existed on two planes at once…  both dark and light, and she came apart so beautifully for Tom, letting him invade her light with his darkness, letting him thaw himself against her flames.</p><p dir="ltr">For him, she took the mask off. Tom had been so concerned with uncovering her secrets that she’d managed to slip beneath his own exterior and sink her hooks into him.</p><p dir="ltr">Now his entire nervous system, his body, his intellect, his spirit, his <em>blood</em> screamed out for her in visceral anguish.</p><p dir="ltr">Every day without her was a spiritual purgatory. </p><p dir="ltr">Tom was alarmed by it… and yet, he could not stop it.</p><p dir="ltr">He often looked back on the past year, racking his brain in an attempt to decipher the moment he’d ceded his carefully cultivated control. </p><p dir="ltr">He had been so sure of himself when he first touched her, there in the gardens below the balcony at Malfoy Manor. She’d come undone beneath his touch, and he’d seen her as a fascinating and enticing plaything.</p><p dir="ltr">The most exciting witch he’d ever met in his life… but nothing more.</p><p dir="ltr">He’d never imagined she would begin to mold him with her soft but capable hands. He never imagined the plans he’d clung to since his school days would be washed away so easily, as if they were merely a castle made of sand. </p><p dir="ltr">But his obsession, his love for Hermione… it was the very blood coursing through his veins. </p><p dir="ltr">It was a stone fortress which he planned to conceal her within… safe, protected, <em>supported</em>. </p><p dir="ltr">His love was a temple of worship, and his marks on her body, the very product of their mutual Nirvana, branding her more deeply than Theravada ink.</p><p dir="ltr">He wanted to become everything Hermione Granger would ever need.</p><p dir="ltr">Tom leaned over, his chest tight and constricted. He spread his hands wide on the desk, and rested his head against the wood. </p><p dir="ltr">In just a few days… he would see her again.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Ostara</em>...</p><p dir="ltr">… where it all began.</p>

<p>Tonight, Tom would push his magic further than he ever had. His followers had traveled by muggle means to their designated locations and were currently awaiting his instructions. </p><p>When their job was finished, he would apparate them all back to London. He wasn’t quite ready to test the efficacy of the dark mark, and he’d thus far failed in his attempts to teach them cross-continental apparation.</p><p>They simply weren’t yet up to his standards magically.</p><p>Avery was in Bangladesh.</p><p>Rosier and Dolohov were in Paris.</p><p>Lestrange was in Sydney.</p><p>MacNair was in Dubai.</p><p>Nott was in HongKong.</p><p>Malfoy was in Sofia.</p><p>Rookwood and Mulciber were in New York City.</p><p>Rowle and Yaxley would take on London and Edinburgh.</p><p>Tom had practiced his long range apparation for months now. He was skilled, but he’d never apparated so much and so far in one night, and to be carrying others with him… </p><p>He would truly find the limits of his power in just a few short hours.</p><p>He’d done everything he could do to prepare. He didn’t want to be too magically drained and exhausted to tend to Hermione at Ostara.</p><p>He had things to discuss with his little siren.</p><p>But for now, his focus lay on his plans.</p><p>After tonight, the political climate in Britain would shift. Tuft would be questioned, and it would only add to the unrest in Britain caused by Hermione’s articles.</p><p>Tom would hold a rally in London the following week. </p><p>Then, Tuft was as good as dead.</p><p>One move at a time, Tom carefully plotted his strategy, as if he were hovering above a chessboard.</p><p>His black chess pieces moved ever closer, circling around the white Queen, their perimeter tightening steadily. </p><p>Hermione was his center of gravity, and he intended to place them in a position of irrefutable political power… together.</p><p>He’d almost forgotten his horcruxes. Though he still desired to locate Slytherin’s locket, Tom’s central focus had become Hermione…</p><p>… and the Minister for Magic position.</p><p>The longer he went without her, the more antsy he became.</p><p>He was no longer a sole entity, and he couldn’t bear being severed from her. As the potion had confirmed, they were two halves of one whole.</p><p>Tom was beginning to realize that his desire for her had little to do with the blue potion that sat on his mantle and the amplified power that their union would bring.</p><p>He <em> needed </em> her.</p><p>He needed her mind. Her participation and partnership. Her body. Her weaknesses. Her tears.</p><p>He needed her glances and her fingertips on his jaw. Her moans, which he never grew complacent to, and her nails digging into his back. He needed her unruly hair in his grip and he needed to watch her bite her lip as he whispered in her ear.</p><p>He needed to debate her. To argue, to challenge her. To see her pretty face grow hot with indignation when she realized he was right, again. To watch her bury her nose once again in her book, seeking where she went wrong in her theorizing.</p><p>He needed her soft words, coaxing out his confessions as if she were a priest. He needed to give it all, to hear her absolve him of his sins against her. </p><p>He needed to make love to her. To show her with his body what she awoke within him. </p><p>Yes, he needed her, but what frightened Tom more than the knowledge that he needed her, was the fact that he wanted <em> her </em> to need <em> him </em>.</p><p>The potion only confirmed what he had already felt in his heart for the better part of a year.</p><p>They belonged to each other…</p><p>… and he would forge no paths without her.</p><p>They were two trailblazers, and he wouldn’t rest until she  stood at his side.</p><p>He was ready for the world to know he’d chosen Hermione Dumbledore.</p><p>But first… she would have to choose him.</p><p>Tom took the small, velvet box from his nightstand and stroked it thoughtfully.</p><p>Tom knew what his death eaters thought. </p><p>They’d already decided that Tom was befuddled by a witch, following along on some romantic tangent.</p><p>But Tom was no romantic.</p><p>It was merely a fact that he and Hermione were divinity embodied, destined to rule as Cleopatra and Caesar had.</p><p>It had crossed Tom’s mind that she was Guinevere, and somewhere in the future, there had surely been a King Arthur that he’d managed to steal her away from.</p><p>Perhaps Gaspard Dufresne was her King Arthur. Perhaps it was Dumbledore himself.</p><p>Tom would have liked to believe that he was Lancelot, a heroic but forbidden love who would steal her away from the Knights of the Round Table.</p><p>But he knew that he was worse. He was Mordred, the dark and traitorous murderer of Arthur. </p><p>Tom laughed to himself. Regardless, he would take his Queen, his throne, and immortality, robbing Death himself.</p><p>Not even Albus Dumbledore would stand in his way.</p><p>Camelot never stood a chance.</p><p>Tom sat in his favorite armchair and cracked open <em> The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore, </em> awaiting the hour when his plans would be set into motion.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p>Hermione walked into the Ministry of Magic on Friday morning to an absolute cacophony of chaos. A slew of interdepartmental memos, far more than usual, whizzed back and forth through the wide corridors, circling around the fountain in the center of the lobby in search of their destination. Hermione looked around her in confusion as witches and wizards ran between offices, heels and men’s brogues clacking on the mirror-like tiled floors. </p><p>Reporters met her as she made her way to the elevator. </p><p>“Auror Dumbledore, can you comment on the breaches?”</p><p>Hermione gazed at them with wide eyes, their quills poised and ready to collect her statement. “I’m sure I have no idea what-“</p><p>“Dumbledore!”</p><p>Hermione’s head snapped to the side in search of her boss’ voice.</p><p>She found him standing by the elevator, holding it open as he gestured to her to join him.</p><p>Hermione’s mouth fell open and she hurried toward him, followed eagerly by the gaggle of the press.</p><p>When she reached Gaspard, he shoved her roughly by the shoulder into the elevator and turned to the reporters. “I suggest that you all return to your places of work until the Ministry schedules an official press briefing. There will be no further comments by the DMLE until then. Please leave our aurors to do their jobs.”</p><p>Then he turned and stalked into the elevator, and the doors closed, shooting them up to Level 2.</p><p>“What has happened, Gaspard?”</p><p>He turned his eyes on her, perhaps caught off guard by her use of his given name. His gaze flicked over her in a quick appraisal, blue eyes betraying a slight bit of concern before he sighed and rubbed his eyes. </p><p>“I’ve been up all night. There have been breaches of the Statute around the world, in at least nine or ten countries that we know of. It appears to be an organized attack.”</p><p>Hermione’s eyes grew wide. “Are there any leads?”</p><p>He shook his head. “The DMLE is still gathering evidence, statements. This investigation is going to be intense. It will involve international cooperation. I have a meeting today with Supreme Mugwump Santos and several delegates of the Confederation. Our hit wizards and aurors are working overtime to neutralize the damage. Thousands and thousands of muggles have been compromised, Hermione.” He glanced at her, his expression hard. “I’d hoped you’d have a bit more experience under your belt before encountering something like this, but it is what it is. We could use your ingenuity… and your skills at uncovering information.”</p><p>Hermione shrugged, still in shock. “Any way I can be of help, Gaspard.”</p><p>He swallowed, looking at her again as she used his name. “Hermione, I-“</p><p>He cleared his throat, cutting his words short with a shake of his head. “Nevermind. We can talk about it later. There’s too much to be done today.”</p><p>Her lips parted as the elevator dinged. “You mean, about the other night…”</p><p>He straightened his tie, and their gazes met. “Later. I need every available auror on the floor immediately.”</p><p>“… yes, sir.”</p><p>His eyes were hungry and uncertain as he looked at her, but he quickly averted his gaze as the elevator doors opened. He walked briskly down the hallway, leaving Hermione gazing after him.</p><p> </p><hr/><p><br/>
He was right. Whoever had organized this attack had chosen crowded areas in large cities to execute elaborate displays of magic. Muggle newspapers were full of terrifying headlines.</p><p>Some blamed it upon aliens, extraterrestrials, and UFOS.</p><p>Some called it the work of an extraordinary magician. </p><p>Some claimed demon possession. Others called it witchcraft.</p><p>Others questioned the existence of supernatural forces.</p><p>International magical leaders corresponded with muggle politicians to get the hysteria under control. The Bulgarian  government was already working on damage control, claiming it was an elaborate show organized by the city.</p><p>There were hundreds of international papers flooding the DMLE, published with their various attempts at explanation.</p><p>There was a small, black and white TV set up in the department to monitor various muggle news stories. </p><p>The obliviation squad was working tirelessly. Hit Wizards were assessing the damages. Aurors were interviewing eyewitnesses undercover, performing legilimency in order to gain more knowledge of the breaches. The interns were fielding memos and taking notes as fast as their quills would write. </p><p>Gaspard returned from his meeting with Santos with some rather grave news. The aurors and officials who weren’t out in the field gathered around to hear the briefing.</p><p>“We have a tentative list of the spells used in each breach and a stack of eyewitness accounts detailing the physical attributes of the perpetrators. It’s… alarming.” He ran his hand over the stubble on his chin. It was clear that he’d had no time to shave and very little sleep that night. “Each and every auror in this department is going to have to submit to questioning by the confederation. While we have been assured that this is just a precautionary measure and a part of protocol… the perpetrators match the descriptions of our team of aurors.”</p><p>The room was silent for a beat.</p><p>“What exactly do you mean?” asked Andrew Rabnott.</p><p>Gaspard sighed. “Whichever terrorist group did this… they were likely under the effects of polyjuice potion.” He looked at them all meaningfully. “They had access to our department and took on the physical appearance of our aurors. To send a message, if I had to guess.”</p><p>Hermione’s eyebrows furrowed. The entire team looked around in shock.</p><p>“How could they have done it?”</p><p>“That,” Gaspard began, “is something we will endeavor to discover in the days to come.”</p><p>Hermione stared at her stack of files. This was an utter and complete mess. Who would’ve done such a thing? She didn’t think it was Tom. This wasn’t anything that she’d ever learned about in her history class, and it certainly wasn’t a move of Voldemort’s as far as she knew.</p><p>Her presence in the timeline couldn’t have altered things <em> that </em> much, could it? That simply wasn’t probable.</p><p>Or had the ministry simply swept this under the rug?</p><p>Something of this magnitude surely would’ve been reported widely. Hermione had learned of lesser breaches to the statute in her History of Magic class.</p><p>Something wasn’t adding up.</p><p>Minister Tuft suddenly came barreling into the department, all fancy clothes and wild eyes and clacking heels. </p><p>“Dufresne, I must speak with you. <em> Now </em>.”</p><p>Gaspard lifted an eyebrow, his expression cool and detached. He silently followed her into his office and the door closed with a click.</p><p>He apparently had dismantled the silencing spells on his office at some point, because her voice boomed through the door. </p><p>“<em> Get me Tom Riddle! </em>” she screeched. “Get him here immediately.”</p><p>Gaspard’s voice was calm and smooth. The rest of the department could barely hear it. They gathered around the door more closely, straining to hear. Hermione made a mental note to check her bag for a pair of Fred and George’s extendable ears. </p><p>“Because I <em> know </em> he’s involved with this!”</p><p>His muffled reply and then her hysterical retort. “I don’t <em> need </em> a reason to have him brought in for questioning and it doesn’t <em> matter </em> how I know. You need to remember your place, Dufresne.”</p><p>Hermione looked at her co-workers with shock, her mouth falling open. She had no love for Minister Tuft, and it was partly for that reason that she waved her wand, casting an amplification charm.</p><p>McLaggen winked at her with a curt nod.</p><p>Gaspard’s voice became clearer. “Minister, I’ll thank you not to come into my department making demands. As far as <em> remembering my place… </em> my place is here, doing my job without interference from other ministry officials who are untrained in the area of law enforcement. I’d like to remind you that this is <em> only </em> my place because I’ve chosen it. I’ve been offered the position of Minister three times since I became head of this department, an offer which I have consistently declined, making it possible for you to take office. So perhaps you’d better learn your place instead. Now, if you have any evidence, or would like to give this department a statement of suspicion, we will take that into account as we move forward with our investigation. Otherwise, I will have to ask you to leave.”</p><p>The door suddenly swung open and the Minister faced them all hotly, her cheeks red with indignation as she met the looks of disgust from the aurors.</p><p>She glared at them all as she walked out of the office and strode angrily back through the door of the auror department, slamming it behind her.</p><p>The day passed in much the same way. There were visits from international law enforcement officers and representatives from the confederation. </p><p>The DMLE was under heat due to the use of polyjuice to take on the appearance of its officers. This led to the belief that the organization responsible was based in Britain. The confederation had already pointed out Azkaban’s breach earlier in the year and the Department’s failure to discover the cause of the breach and to locate the prisoner’s whereabouts. The robbery at the Historical Society was also brought into question. By the end of the day, to say that Gaspard was irritable was an understatement. </p><p>Hermione was chatting with Septimus Weasley, who, being a fellow delegate of the confederation, was charged along with Myra Grimblehawk with traveling to New York City over the weekend by way of Portkey, to meet with the head of MACUSA. As they were discussing the details of the breaches which were still incoming, Dufresne’s door opened.</p><p>“Dumbledore, get in here!”</p><p>Hermione gave Septimus an apologetic smile and entered the office. </p><p>“Sir?”</p><p>“Given the severity of the situation, we need all hands on deck. I know you’re technically off tomorrow, but do you have plans?”</p><p>“Oh,” she murmured, thinking. “Well, I was supposed to attend the Ostara Ball at Malfoy Manor tomorrow evening, but I could always can-“</p><p>“No, don’t do that,” he interrupted. “I will call someone else in. But I need your help first thing Monday morning. More should surface in the next 48 hours.” He flicked his eyes up at her and exhaled, his expression grave. “I don’t suppose I should ask you this… but is this something you would’ve known about?”</p><p>She shook her head. “I’ve never heard of this happening, Gaspard. I’m equally as perplexed.”</p><p>He nodded pensively. “Minister Tuft seems to think Riddle has something to do with it.”</p><p>Hermione gazed at him. “I heard.”</p><p>“Did you?”</p><p>She nodded. “She was rather loud.”</p><p>“What are your thoughts?”</p><p>She shook her head. “I don’t know. I wish I could say I knew. It would be rather unusual, if that’s true.”</p><p>Gaspard reclined in his chair, rubbing his chin thoughtfully. “Who will you attend that ball with?”</p><p>“Abraxas Malfoy.”</p><p>Gaspard’s lips twitched, his eyebrows lifting in surprise.</p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes. “I’m not any particular fan of his. I attended with him last year, and somehow I’ve been coerced into it this year as well.”</p><p>His mouth quirked. “I don’t blame any wizard for wanting you on their arm, Hermione. I do begrudge him your time, though. Especially since I’ll be here, dealing with this mess for the foreseeable future.”</p><p>Their eyes met. Hermione’s lips parted, uncertainty painting her features.</p><p>Gaspard cleared his throat. “I want to apologize for the other night. I don’t regret it… but I do regret us both being drunk when it happened.”</p><p>Hermione shook her head. “There’s nothing to apologize for. I’m a grown woman… not a child.”</p><p>His jaw tensed. “How <em>very</em> <em>aware</em> of that I am.”</p><p>His blue eyes sparked with heat as they locked with hers. It was Hermione’s turn to clear her throat. </p><p>“I don’t expect anything, Hermione. There’s no need to be anxious.” He carefully examined her. “I would like to see you again… only if or when you feel so inclined.”</p><p>Hermione’s heart beat swiftly. Again, she was faced with the same predicament. A very real and present attraction to her boss… but a very real and ever-present awareness of her feelings for Tom Riddle, branding her like a scar that continued to pain her.</p><p>She swallowed. “I appreciate that, Gaspard. I would like that too, but I fear I may need some time, if that’s alright.”</p><p>His eyes were unreadable as always, his emotion hidden beneath that careful mask he wore at all times. He nodded. “Of course, Hermione. Take all the time that you need.” His eyes flicked down to the stack of files and scrolls on his desk. “I have more than enough to keep me occupied for a month, it appears.”</p><p>“I look forward to aiding the investigation, come Monday.”</p><p>He nodded stoically. “Take care this weekend, Dumbledore.” He inclined his head. “Be safe.”</p><p> </p>

</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">Maximilian Dolohov sat in the sunroom at Tuft Manor. Across a little breakfast table set with tea, Wilhelmina Tuft sat with her ankles crossed in a ladylike manner. </p><p dir="ltr">“So tell me, Maximilian Dolohov… Were these attacks orchestrated by Tom Riddle?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Ah ah ah,” Dolohov chided. “You won’t get a confession out of me.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Then why are you here?”</p><p dir="ltr">“I think you and I can be mutually beneficial.”</p><p dir="ltr">Tuft laughed. “That’s what Riddle said, too… and now look at the state of things. It seems the only one who benefited from our alliance was him.”</p><p dir="ltr">Dolohov grinned. “That’s because what you wanted was something he never agreed to give.”</p><p dir="ltr">Wilhelmina’s eyes grew cold. Murderous. It took several moments before she spoke. “Still… these younger ones have no respect for the way things are done in our political system. Favors are rewarded. But Riddle has done nothing in return for my kindness but chip away at my reputation. Him and his… witch.”</p><p dir="ltr">Dolohov lifted his chin slightly, peering at her. “So you know about Hermione.”</p><p dir="ltr">Tuft scoffed. “Of course I do. I make it my business to know everything about my political allies… and even more, my enemies.”</p><p dir="ltr">Dolohov’s eyebrows shot up. “You see Tom as an enemy now?”</p><p dir="ltr">Wilhelmina took a sip of tea. “I don’t see how he could be anything but. He’s made it painfully obvious.”</p><p dir="ltr">Dolohov’s eyes narrowed thoughtfully. “I don’t think Riddle is the one you should be angry at.”</p><p dir="ltr">Her eyebrows rose sharply. “No?”</p><p dir="ltr">Dolohov shook his head. “It’s Hermione Dumbledore. She’s the cause of all this. I guarantee that if we could take care of her… we could get this whole thing back on track.”</p><p dir="ltr">Wilhelmina allowed her eyes to wander Dolohov’s form in appraisal. Then her gaze returned to his, and her eyes were suspicious. “I don’t know if I trust any of you… what is it that you’re called? Death Eaters?”</p><p dir="ltr">Dolohov smirked wryly.</p><p dir="ltr">She continued to examine him. “I know your families well… but you younger set don’t keep to tradition, clearly. You have your own agenda. How would I know that Tom hasn’t sent you here to test me?”</p><p dir="ltr">He sipped his firewhiskey. “I don’t suppose you could know for certain. We are all just walking Riddle’s tightrope, it seems.”</p><p dir="ltr">Her eyes flared with indignation. “I am doing no such thing! I will see Riddle in Azkaban if it’s the last thing I do.” She collected herself, and sat back in her chair calmly. “However, if you and I can come to an understanding… I could see to it that you and your other friends are spared. I would hate to see good pure blood rotting away in Azkaban. Then where would wizarding society be? Magic is might, after all.”</p><p dir="ltr">Dolohov’s lips curved into a sinister smile. “It’s good to know you see things my way.”</p><p dir="ltr">Wilhelmina dragged her perfectly manicured nail along the rim of her teacup. “So why should I hear what you have to say? Why would I trust you?”</p><p dir="ltr">His eyes met hers. “I’m sure you’re aware of Walburga Black and her hatred for Hermione Dumbledore.”</p><p dir="ltr">Tuft nodded slowly.</p><p dir="ltr">“Walburga and I are close.”</p><p dir="ltr">Tuft’s eyes narrowed. “How close?”</p><p dir="ltr">Dolohov leaned forward, his coffee-colored eyes boring into hers. “Close,” he whispered.</p><p dir="ltr">She cocked a brow, then cleared her throat. “What are you suggesting we do, Mr. Dolohov?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Something about Hermione isn’t as it seems. I don’t know what. We’ve combed ministry records, interrogated her mother’s acquaintances… No one seems to have anything beyond a passing recollection of a romantic relationship between Dumbledore and this Eleanor Dagworth-Granger. Legilimency brings up only very specific memories… all the same. No variation. It reeks of memory tampering.”</p><p dir="ltr">Tuft’s eyes narrowed. “And you assume I can help you with this?”</p><p dir="ltr">He ran his tongue over his teeth. “I don’t know that you can. If this is Dumbledore’s doing, he’s got everything locked down tightly. Perhaps there’s a few wizards who owe him favors. Regardless, if we could get inside Hermione’s mind, we would know for sure.”</p><p dir="ltr">Tuft’s eyes grew wide. “You mean to kidnap her?”</p><p dir="ltr">Dolohov shrugged. “It’s a thought.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Wouldn’t Riddle punish you for such a thing?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Not if he doesn’t know.”</p><p dir="ltr">“How is that possible?”</p><p dir="ltr">“With your help, of course. If the ministry suspected her of a false identity, then legilimency could be the solution to confirm those suspicions. An arrest… a warrant. These are things you can achieve as minister, yes?”</p><p dir="ltr">Tuft laughed. “Then have Riddle after my head?”</p><p dir="ltr">Dolohov shook his head. “He’s not stupid enough to go after the Minister for Magic. Besides… He’s not the one you should worry about.” His eyes pierced hers. “Hermione is the biggest threat to you, Minister. Already, London talks of her as the next Minister. I know you’d hoped your son would run when you step down.”</p><p dir="ltr">Tuft’s expression hardened. She bristled with unrepressed anger. “She has gained too much influence for one so young. This is not how things are done in London.”</p><p dir="ltr">Dolohov’s lips quirked as he realized his tactics were working. “No, of course not. She hasn’t schmoozed the rich and powerful at balls and dinner parties and over tea. She hasn’t jumped through our societal hoops, so to speak. She can’t be allowed to bypass social protocol. As young as she is, can you imagine how her influence could grow in the coming years? Not to mention, she’s quite magically powerful, as well.”</p><p dir="ltr">Tuft rolled her eyes. “I’d hoped that, by being so young, she might make ill-advised errors and destroy her own reputation. Put her foot in her mouth, I mean. I’d anticipated she might cast some doubt on Dumbledore’s name as well. But none of that has happened. She seems unable to do any wrong in the eyes of the public. It’s sickening.” Her eyes fell to her teacup. “I don’t understand Riddle’s fascination with her either.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Nor do I. Nevertheless, I’m ready to put an end to it.”</p><p dir="ltr">Tuft smiled slyly. “You think to control Tom Riddle? That’s a dangerous game.”</p><p dir="ltr">Dolohov grinned in return. “I’m a bold wizard.”</p><p dir="ltr">She smiled wider. “You’re also a stupid one if you think that I’m going to take all of the risk on my own shoulders.”</p><p dir="ltr">He chuckled. “I don’t expect that, Minister. Not in the least. Only tell me what I can do. I merely need your approval and the ministry’s aid.”</p><p dir="ltr">She searched his countenance curiously. “Why do you turn on Riddle, I wonder?”</p><p dir="ltr">His jaw tensed, a flash of anger and madness surfacing. “He’s thinking with his cock.”</p><p dir="ltr">“And you aren’t?”</p><p dir="ltr">His eyes sparked with fury. “She’s changing his beliefs. His standards are falling.”</p><p dir="ltr">“What do you mean?”</p><p dir="ltr">“He’s been researching blood purity. Says it’s on its way out and we’ve all got to breed with mudbloods,” he spat with thinly veiled disgust.</p><p dir="ltr">Her brows drew forward sharply. “What?”</p><p dir="ltr">He nodded, saying nothing.</p><p dir="ltr">Her eyes were wide. “Is Hermione a mudblood?”</p><p dir="ltr">He cocked his head. “Why do you ask that?”</p><p dir="ltr">Her eyes were hard. “Why would he need to justify intermarrying if she’s a pureblood?”</p><p dir="ltr">Dolohov shrugged. “I assumed that she’d swayed his thinking in favor of her own distasteful beliefs.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Yes, but you’ve already stated that it’s possible she’s hiding something.”</p><p dir="ltr">He eyed her closely. “Walburga said something similar.”</p><p dir="ltr">Tuft swallowed. “So what you’re saying, Mr. Dolohov, is that we might be able to discredit Hermione in the eyes of the public… even possibly arrest her and put her away?”</p><p dir="ltr">He smirked. “I wouldn’t mind seeing the smug little cunt put away in Azkaban, personally.”</p><p dir="ltr">Wilhelmina rubbed her lips together, then sipped her tea primly. “I will give this some thought, until our next meeting. Are any of your comrades of the same mind?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Malfoy… MacNair… a few others are on the fence. More out of fear of Riddle than anything else. Will you be at Ostara tonight, Minister?”</p><p dir="ltr">“I wouldn’t miss it.”</p><p dir="ltr">——————-</p><p dir="ltr">Hermione would be at Ostara in less than two hours, but she couldn’t bring herself to rise from the bath. She lay in the oversized clawfoot tub in her bathroom, looking out through its window over her terrace. The light was just beginning to fade from the skies, casting the clouds in purple, pink, and red… it would’ve been beautiful, if it didn’t remind her of bruised flesh and blood, instilling her with a sense of foreboding. It reminded her of her days on the run with Harry and Ron, when they had little to do but read and observe nature while they racked their brains for clues.</p><p dir="ltr">She sighed, and sunk deeper into the water. Candles flickered on the little table nearby, which was spread with her bath oils on a silver filigree tray and an ornate brush which Piksy used to brush out her hair. Hermione insisted she could do it on her own, but Piksy had always tended her mistress’ hair and baths in France, and it gave the little elf a sense of comfort. Not only that, but she was actually extremely skilled at taming Hermione’s unruly locks, so she wasn’t complaining in the least.</p><p dir="ltr">Hermione watched the flickering magical flames, which glowed brighter in the dimming light. Her fingertips absently traced the letters etched into her arm. </p><p dir="ltr">She would see Riddle tonight, she was sure of it.</p><p dir="ltr">Did she want to see him?</p><p dir="ltr">The thrill which fluttered in her stomach and the unsettling twinge in her chest told her that she did.</p><p dir="ltr">A shiver of excitement and anticipation coursed through her body.</p><p dir="ltr">Was it because of their encounter at Flourish and Blotts? The way his eyes had fixed on her as if she were the only witch in existence?</p><p dir="ltr">Or had she gotten most of her frustration out by writing in the journal?</p><p dir="ltr">She knew she shouldn’t be feeling this way. She’d been the one to break things off, after all, and she had no reason to believe he’d be different now than he was months ago. </p><p dir="ltr">She shouldn’t allow herself to expect growth from someone like Voldemort. </p><p dir="ltr">Still, she couldn’t help the small smile that turned up her lips and the slight tremble of her fingers at the exhilarating thought of seeing Tom in the very location where they’d first met a year ago.</p><p dir="ltr">The night they’d almost kissed, inexplicably drawn toward each other like magnets.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Say my name</em>.</p><p dir="ltr">She heard his impatient, commanding voice in her mind.</p><p dir="ltr">“Tom,” she whispered, holding her breath as she always did as she waited for a fullness that now didn’t come. </p><p dir="ltr">She missed him around her, inside her. His scent, a vapor around her… his voice, cold and impatient and lustful in her ear, his cock driving into her as if he could dissolve himself into her… his hand like a necklace around her throat.</p><p dir="ltr">She sighed again as she spread her legs, and her fingers wandered between them. </p><p dir="ltr">“Tom…”</p><p> </p><hr/><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">
<em>Tom!</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>Hermione’s voice rang with alarm and fear. So much fear. </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>Tom was running in the dark. Running toward her voice, at a speed he’d never known himself capable of.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>“Hermione!” He called, waiting to hear her reply, his head snapping from side to side, searching, listening. </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>His heart thudded rapidly, panic and terror rushing through his adrenal system. </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>“Tom!”</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>He heard her voice again, almost sounding like a sob, but from farther away.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>He took off running. He whipped out his wand as he ran, jumping over tree trunks and through bramble, briars snatching at his face and hands; blood trickled down his cheeks. </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>He’d never felt panic such as this. It completely unnerved him.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>But where was she?</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>Suddenly, he emerged into a clearing. A stream trickled nearby, but in the darkness, he couldn’t make out exactly what his eyes were landing on. He flicked his wand, casting a charm that sharpened his eyesight, allowing him a sort of night vision.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>He was surrounded by masked, cloaked figures. They arced around him in a semi-circle, holding their wands out away from their bodies. </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>Tom’s chest heaved with labored breathing, his eyebrows furrowing sharply as he took stock of the figures. They wore the masks he’d procured for his death eaters at Borgin &amp; Burkes.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>Surely not…</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>“Where is she?” he demanded, his voice a hiss.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>The masked figures looked at each other.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>There came a chuckle, and then an obscure voice, one that would almost be unrecognizable if he didn’t know it so well. It was the voice of Abraxas Malfoy. </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>The voice responded, “We do not speak parseltongue, Lord Voldemort.”</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>He had been unaware that in his panic he’d resorted to speaking parseltongue.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>He started forward. “Where is she? Tell me before I burn every one of you alive.”</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>The voice laughed.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>“She’s gone.”</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>Tom launched himself at the cloaked figure, conjuring a sword, which whistled as he swung it through the air, a viper striking so quickly there was barely time left to react, severing the man’s head from the rest of his body.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>Several of the figures disbanded, apparating away. The remainder cloistered together, raising their wands. Tom had no awareness of how much time he spent dueling them all simultaneously, until he finally engulfed them in a swathe of fiendfyre. </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>Her voice no longer rang out.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>In a desperate rage, he turned to the body of the decapitated figure. He cast the killing curse at the chest of the body. He watched the green curse strike. Then he cast it again.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>Again and again, he spent his magic upon the corpse, screaming in maddened fury until his voice became hoarse.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>Then he quickly conjured another blade. A short, deadly dagger. He stalked forward and fell upon the body, driving the blade into its chest and ripping it down, slicing open the cavity between its ribs. Then he shredded every inch of the body, overcome with a wrath he’d never felt before, not even when he’d faced his own father.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>He turned to where the head had fallen and rolled away. </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>He knelt down, hands, chest, and face covered in spatters of dark blood. He turned the head over and removed the mask. </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>The face looking back at him was not Abraxas Malfoy.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>Skin, grayed and dry, riddled with black veins, stretched over bony, angular, features. The face was thin and skeletal, with nearly rotting teeth and snake-like red eyes which were still open and stared back at him mockingly.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>Red eyes.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>The creature’s nose was nonexistent, and collapsed into two slits in the center of the skull.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>Tom examined the face, his mouth growing dry and his tongue tasting like sandpaper as he began to notice some familiarity about the corpse.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>As he continued to examine the face, suddenly it’s lips moved.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>A snakelike tongue darted out to lick the thin, purpling lips. </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>Then those same lips curved into a sinister smile.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><hr/><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Tom awoke suddenly with a deep gasp, choking on air.</p><p dir="ltr">He was sweating profusely, heart beating out of his chest. </p><p dir="ltr">He’d been sleeping since he returned from his last trip, apparating Yaxley back from Edinburgh. He’d collapsed as soon as they appeared in the drawing room of Malfoy Manor.</p><p dir="ltr">He’d done it. He hadn’t splinched himself, nor any of his death eaters. He’d safely apparated them all back to London. But he was severely magically drained.</p><p dir="ltr">He’d been sleeping ever since, in the guest wing of Malfoy Manor.</p><p dir="ltr">How strange that he should have that dream here, of all places. </p><p dir="ltr">But what did it mean?</p><p dir="ltr">Tom was no seer, although he’d always received high marks in divination. However, when it came to Hermione, he was known to have dreams, feelings, even premonitions.</p><p dir="ltr">Something wasn’t right, and he intended to discover what that was. He would take no chances when it came to Hermione.</p><p dir="ltr">He gazed out through the windows, past the balcony railings, beyond the hedge maze and the enormous iron gates, to the sky which was imbrued by a blood-red sunset. </p><p dir="ltr">He waited until his muscles, which were coiled with tension, relaxed, and his heart rate slowed.</p><p dir="ltr">He checked his pocket watch, which was still stuffed into his coat. One hour til Ostara began.</p><p dir="ltr">He laid back onto the bed spread with silken, sweet-smelling sheets. He snorted, thinking of the comfortable, balmy way in which Malfoy had grown up.</p><p dir="ltr">Tom had become so used to his hard mattress in the orphanage that he could never sleep on a soft one like this.</p><p dir="ltr">Tom thought of the dream… of the face beneath the mask.</p><p dir="ltr">Deep down, he knew the face was his…</p><p dir="ltr">… and yet, it wasn’t.</p><p dir="ltr">He swallowed, finding his mouth dry and his throat sore… as if he’d been screaming in his sleep.</p><p dir="ltr">There was a cracking sound, and he found Malfoy’s house elf standing on a little table across the room, holding a garment bag.</p><p dir="ltr">“Master Malfoy has sent me for your clothes, Master Riddle. Should Dobby draw a bath?”</p><p dir="ltr">Tom sighed, then nodded curtly to the elf.</p><p dir="ltr">He’d been sleeping for nearly forty hours. </p><p dir="ltr">It was not his first experience with magical exhaustion, but it was the first time his plans had hinged on his own stamina, and it was the first time he feared he might fail. </p><p dir="ltr">He’d apparated nearly 64,000 miles, all in all, in the span of one night. Every muscle in his body ached. He was famished, and his magical core was strained and bruised, for lack of a better description.</p><p dir="ltr">His death eaters had been absolutely terrified. He’d assured them that they would not be splinched, nor injured, but he hadn’t been entirely sure that was true. </p><p dir="ltr">Thankfully, his hard work and practice paid off.</p><p dir="ltr">He could still recall their ghostly pale faces as they balked at him, each one staring at him when he finally came back with Yaxley from Edinburgh, the last leg of the trip.</p><p dir="ltr">They’d looked him up and down as if he were the grim reaper, or a god, or death himself.</p><p dir="ltr">Then, he’d collapsed, losing consciousness completely.</p><p dir="ltr">He had no knowledge of the fallout or repercussions as yet.</p><p dir="ltr">He stood slowly, feeling his bones crack in nearly  every place. He walked gingerly to the bathroom, shedding articles of clothing as he went. </p><p dir="ltr">When he sunk himself into the hot bath, he exhaled slowly in relief as the hot water began to relax his sore muscles. </p><p dir="ltr">“Dobby!” he called hoarsely.</p><p dir="ltr">Crack.</p><p dir="ltr">“Yes, sir?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Bring me a fucking cigarette. Lucky Strikes only. And a copy of the Prophet, too.”</p><p dir="ltr">The house elf disappeared and returned with a pack of the Finnish cigarettes he’d requested and the evening edition of the Prophet.</p><p dir="ltr">Tom flicked his eyes to the elf, then muttered a gruff, “Thank you,” as he shoved a cigarette between his lips. </p><p dir="ltr">The elf gazed at him with wide eyes for a moment, then turned and swiftly pitter-pattered out of the room.</p><p dir="ltr">He attempted to light it wandlessly, and he smirked to himself as the end of the fag sparked and blazed cherry red. </p><p dir="ltr">His magic was already replenishing.</p><p dir="ltr">He leaned back in the tub, allowing the heat of the steaming water to sink into his limbs. He breathed in the smoke deeply, then unfolded the copy of the Daily Prophet to admire his work. </p><p dir="ltr">Except there, on the front page, was a photograph of Morsmordre, his dark mark, blazing bright in the night sky above Paris, the Eiffel Tower lit up like a Christmas tree below. The photograph moved, giving a perfect view of the skull, a serpent slithering out of its mouth.</p><p dir="ltr">Tom’s jaw tensed, and he growled, standing up with a splash and exiting the bath, leaving a trail of water after him.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><hr/><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Hermione gazed at the dress which hung in her bedroom. It was reminiscent of the dress she’d worn last year to Ostara, but rather than dusky grey-blue velvet, the dress was black as night. Thin, floral straps climbed over her shoulders like the vines of devil’s snare. The bodice of the gown consisted of gathered black leaves and roses, appliquéd over sheer mesh, the back of which was see-through. The design trailed down the raven-colored tulle skirt like a nocturnal garden, leading to a jewel-flecked hem, which was enchanted to shimmer like starlight.</p><p dir="ltr">Madam Malkin was rather put out that she’d had it custom made by a muggle designer and enchanted it herself, but Hermione didn’t care. She’d seen the designer’s other dresses on Elizabeth Taylor and Vivien Leigh and knew it was a necessary switch. </p><p dir="ltr">The designer had actually given her the choice between four different designs, but when Hermione laid eyes on the black, it seemed to call to her. </p><p dir="ltr">When she slipped into it, allowing Piksy to help her with the buttons which trailed up her spine, it seemed to fit itself to the very threads of her magic. She gazed into the bronze, floor length mirror and hardly recognized herself. Her hair was curled in the popular style of the season, but pinned low with a golden crown of leaves at the base of her neck. She’d scrubbed her skin pink in the bath and rubbed perfumed oils into her tanned skin, so that it glowed effervescently against the dark gown. </p><p dir="ltr">She swiped a maroon lipstick over her lips and slid Dumbledore’s ring onto her finger, then clasped the Phoenix and Serpent necklace around her neck, letting the delicate pendant settle into the hollow of her throat. </p><p dir="ltr">This year’s ball was a masquerade. Hanging from her mirror was a delicate black mask inlaid with jewels. She lifted it and tied it to her face with its silk ribbons. </p><p dir="ltr">She examined her reflection.</p><p>She truly looked the part of Persephone, Queen of the Underworld. Perhaps she was always meant to be halfway in the dark, halfway in the light.</p><p dir="ltr">She gazed down at the subtle flickering of the stars in her dress. </p><p dir="ltr">Now that she looked at it, she realized the stars shone much brighter against the blackness.</p><p dir="ltr">Hermione took a deep breath, and apparated away. </p>

<em>I was ashamed of myself when I realized life was a costume party and I attended with my real face.</em>
</p><p align="center">
<em>- Franz Kafka </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Edward Rosier leaned against the wall of the drawing room, swirling his fifth firewhiskey of the night in his glass. Ostara hadn’t even begun yet, and he was well on his way to being toasted by the end of the night. He tipped the glass back and finished it off, then set it aside and ran a hand down the front of his crimson velvet suit. He straightened the collar of his black shirt, crimson tie, then looked down at the shine of his black shoes. </p><p>All dressed up and no one to see.</p><p>No one he wanted to see, anyway.</p><p>These fucking parties bored him to death of late. </p><p>Perhaps the guests’ murmurings about the breaches would be interesting enough to hold his attention. He glanced around the room. Dolohov stood in a corner with his date, Alicent Bulstrode. He was fucking Walburga Black, the slytherin mattress, but she was attending with her fiancé Orion. They’d probably be arriving soon. Edward couldn’t have cared less. It was nothing but a bloody charade, as much of his world was.</p><p>He cared very little in general these days. </p><p>He readjusted his mask, which was also crimson and had two horns, imitating the devil of the muggle world. Its horns poked up through his chocolate brown curls.</p><p>His old school friends all stood in various positions around the room, some drinking, some talking quietly. Some stood staring through the windows watching as the first guests arrived.</p><p>They were all waiting for Tom. </p><p>It was uncanny how Tom had become the thing which knit them all together. </p><p>They’d seen him collapse, and it was the first sign of humanity they’d witnessed in several years. </p><p>But only after a feat of nearly impossible magical proportions.</p><p>
<em> How had he done such a thing? </em>
</p><p>None of them had spoken since. They were too racked with fear.</p><p>They were beginning to realize that this was no schoolboys’ club. Not anymore.</p><p>Tom was pushing the limits of what was possible for wizardkind… even for Dumbledore himself.</p><p>It was frightening, seeing that kind of power in action. Watching someone they’d known as a skinny, impoverished orphan suddenly become the most powerful wizard they’d ever encountered. Standing at his side as he stretched his power like a cord around them all, making it work, making it <em> last </em>. </p><p>Doing things that only Merlin had been rumored to have accomplished.</p><p>Rosier was the only one who had also witnessed Tom fly.</p><p>Tom had asked him not to mention it to the others, so he hadn’t.</p><p>They would all probably vomit if they saw it.</p><p>Tom had dug himself out of the graveyard of his muggle infancy with bloodied fingernails and climbed an impossible mountain, elevating himself to the level of a god.</p><p>Rosier didn’t know what to think.</p><p>Some part of him admired Tom. Some part of him feared him.</p><p>Some part of him loved him.</p><p>Some part of him hated him.</p><p>Hated him for his surety, for his commitment to what he wanted most in life. </p><p>Rosier had never gone after what he wanted.</p><p>He’d sat back in his depression and waited for what he wanted to come to him.</p><p>Whenever it did, it inevitably was ripped away.</p><p>The door of the drawing room opened, and Tom walked through. He wore all black, a sharply tailored suit with baroque stitching along the collar. His shirt and tie were black, even his mask, which covered half his face. Instead of the usual way he wore his inky hair, curled and falling over his forehead, it was clipped shorter than usual and slicked back in the popular style of the day. </p><p>He was sleek and terrifying, like a black panther.</p><p>Rosier was suddenly filled with dread. He lifted his eyes and they locked with Dolohov’s, then Avery’s. One by one, each of the wizards walked to the center of the room, ready to be greeted by their leader.</p><p>The first thing Rosier noticed was his eyes. They were blazing red, which never boded well.</p><p>Lord Voldemort entered the room and stalked across the expensive carpet, jerking a pack of cigarettes from his suit jacket and lighting one as he came to stand before them.</p><p>He inhaled as he looked at them all. </p><p>Malfoy piped up, “My mother would have a fit if she knew you were smo-“</p><p>Tom’s eyes turned on Malfoy sharply, and the latter’s words failed him.</p><p>There was only silence for a beat. Tom’s eyes cut like a blade, his expression severe. </p><p>He lifted his hand and took the cigarette between his thumb and index finger, inhaling snappily and pulling it away. </p><p>Then he spoke, and his words were like daggers.</p><p>“What did I fucking tell you all?” He walked along the line formed by his followers, meeting their gazes. “I told you <em>not</em> <em>yet</em>. I told you, <em>do…</em> <em>not…</em> <em>cast…</em> <em>MORDSMORDRE</em>!” </p><p>His voice rose to a booming, wrathful pitch.</p><p>He came to stand before Rosier. “And what did you do?”</p><p>Rosier interjected solemnly. “I didn’t cast it, my Lord.”</p><p>Tom paused and his head instantly snapped to the side, his gaze aimed at Dolohov. “<em> You </em>.” His legs carried him over to stand before Dolohov. They stood eye to eye, and Tom took another drag from his cigarette before expelling the smoke into the other’s face. “You-“</p><p>“It was an accident, my Lord.”</p><p>Tom cocked his head, eyes narrowing. “An accident?” He laughed acidly, looking to his other followers in complete incredulity. “An accident, he says.”</p><p>He took his wand from his inner pocket and there were sharp intakes of breath around the room. Dolohov’s eyes widened a fraction and his adam’s apple bobbed.</p><p>Tom twirled his wand in his fingers.</p><p>Then he paused.</p><p>“Crucio.”</p><p>Dolohov collapsed with a guttural scream.</p><p>“Do you take me for an absolute fool, Dolohov?” He stared at him as he writhed on the floor.</p><p>He held the torture curse for another minute. Rosier gulped. He’d only felt the affects of the torture curse in practice. Tom had used the spell briefly on them all, reasoning that they all needed to know the effects of the curse in order to know fully what they were faced with if it were ever cast upon them.</p><p>Mere seconds were all it took for Rosier to know that he never wanted to experience it again.</p><p>Dolohov, however, was a few marbles short.</p><p>Dolohov was hunched over on his hands and knees, face buried in the carpet as he wailed. Rosier watched him passively. He had no great love for Dolohov, and he found his use of the spell stupid, at best.</p><p>Suicidal, at worst.</p><p>None of them knew why he did it. With Dolohov’s mutinous murmurings, Rosier feared he intended some betrayal, but he couldn’t figure out how.</p><p>Rosier wasn’t sure which side he would take, when it came down to it.</p><p>The more the curse was used upon a person, the worse its effects became. In essence, it wore on the nerves until they were permanently damaged. It affected the mind, scrambling one’s consciousness.</p><p>Tom relented, breaking his hold on the curse. </p><p>“I don’t trust you. No, I don’t. You’re on my fucking list, now, Max. You’ve sabotaged this organization one time too many. You’re out. Don’t come to the meetings.”</p><p>Dolohov groaned, but managed to grit out a desperate plea, “But my lord, I’ve taken the mark-“</p><p>“Then I’ll cut your <em> fucking </em> arm off. Would you like that?”</p><p>Tom stared at him, his red eyes like flames. </p><p>Suddenly, Dolohov caught on fire. </p><p>Tom hadn’t even lifted his wand, nor moved an inch. </p><p>Several of the men started, crying out in fear. </p><p>But Tom waved his wand, a simple movement that extinguished the flames instantly. </p><p>Then he took another drag.</p><p>Rosier’s eyes found Malfoy’s. He knew what those silver eyes were communicating.</p><p>How had Tom, as magically drained as he was, been able to cast <em> crucio </em>so powerfully, and conjure fire with his mere gaze?</p><p>Malfoy’s expression was one of shock, and his eyes returned to Tom. </p><p>Tom waved his hand, vanishing the cigarette. “We’ll talk about this later. You’re out, until you can prove yourself worthy. And if you’re ever out for good, Max, then the <em> least </em> you have  to worry about is that mark on your arm. Trust me on that.”</p><p>Tom adjusted his black silk tie. “All of you, stay out of my way entirely tonight. I don’t want to hear <em> fuck all </em> from any of you.”</p><p>Then he turned and stalked to the double doors, ripping them wide as he exited the room, his cloak curling about him.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Winifred Haywood stood on the steps of Malfoy Manor, linked arm in arm with her older brother, Tobias. She’d been invited by her friend Corelius Crouch, but Winifred had always been plagued by a bit of social anxiety and preferred to lean on her elder brother. Her flaxen hair was done up in elaborate braids like a halo upon her head, and her silver dress matched the glittering mask that shaded her eyes. She looked like an angel or a delicate snow bird, flown down from the arctic, migrating south for the winter. </p><p>Monty and Effie Potter climbed the steps alongside them. Effie was a vision of the season’s fashion, with her light brown bob, teal gown, and red lipstick, closely resembling the Daisy Buchanan of the magical world. </p><p>“You’ll be fine, Winnie,” murmured Effie with a smile and a squeeze of her hand. “Whatever happens, you know who you are.”</p><p>The two couples entered through the mammoth double doors and were immediately escorted to the ballroom.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>“My, my, <em> my </em>,” exclaimed Abraxas Malfoy as he took Hermione’s hand, and bent over to place a chaste kiss on her gloved hand. There was nothing chaste, however, about the glint in his eye.</p><p>“Hello, again, dear Abraxas,” Hermione muttered coyly, her firewhiskey eyes sparkling.</p><p>“Forgive me for saying so,” he murmured softly. “But this seems to be a full circle moment. A year ago I escorted a poised, but uncertain witch on my arm. One who made the gossips whisper with curiosity. But today, I daresay I’m being escorted myself, by a dark goddess who demands reverence. You’ve certainly come into your own in the past year, Hermione. I congratulate you on your profound success.”</p><p>Hermione’s lips curved into a slow, languid smile as she examined the wizard before her. “I appreciate that, Abraxas. You’re too kind.” Then she lowered her voice and whispered conspiratorially, but it came out sounding threatening, “More than anything, I applaud your recognition that goddesses are not to be trifled with.”</p><p>Abraxas cocked a brow, then bowed his head as he chuckled darkly under his breath. “I wouldn’t dare to trifle with you, Miss Dumbledore.” He lowered his voice as he led her toward the ballroom, his eyes dancing over her exposed skin. “That is unless, of course, you would like me to.”</p><p>They emerged into the immense ballroom. Hermione had admittedly not been in this part of the manor in many months, not since the night Tom had cast a spell over her and pushed her physical and emotional boundaries to their limit. </p><p>Her eyes searched for him first, but he was nowhere to be found.</p><p>The ballroom was nearly unrecognizable. Last year, the room had been decked out in blue and silver, but this year, a magical trellis formed the ceiling, upon which grew enchanted vines and flowers. Roses of blood red, magenta, and periwinkle grew from the florid vines. The entire room was like an evergreen garden, and the guests with their colorful gowns and sparkling masks, were like the faeries of ancient Druid tales.</p><p>The beauty of the enchantments was so wistful that Hermione caught her breath for a moment, until she noticed Abraxas staring. </p><p>There was something disconcerting about his expression, which was searching and troubled.</p><p>“I believe you now know almost everyone in attendance, my dear,” he said quietly. “I don’t imagine I can impress you with my powerful acquaintances, as you’re more likely to know them better than I do these days. Would you care to dance?”</p><p>Hermione smiled and nodded, and allowed him to take her into the dancefloor. </p><p>She placed a hand on his shoulder and he took her waist, and began to spin her softly around the floor. The music was live, and the famous singer, Celestina Warbeck, crooned a jazzy ballad in her warm, throaty vocals. </p><p>“Oh,” Hermione breathed excitedly. “<em> Celestina Warbeck </em>!”</p><p>Abraxas grinned. “A close friend of my family. I could introduce you, if you like.”</p><p>Hermione cocked a brow. “I’m surprised you’d lower yourself to associate with a witch who has a muggle mother… and a Gryffindor, no less.”</p><p>“Now, now,” he chided. “Exceptions can always be made. I’m not a complete barbarian, as you seem so determined to make me out to be.”</p><p>“That statement by itself was decidedly barbaric, but thankfully I don’t expect any better from you, Mr. Malfoy.”</p><p>His brows furrowed, lips turning into a scowl. He gazed at her searchingly as they spun about the floor. “I can’t quite put my finger on what it is about you that makes me want to win your approval, Hermione. You could make a zebra question its own stripes.”</p><p>Hermione smirked and batted her eyelashes, clicking her gaze to his. “If I could make you question anything, I’d like to start with that cravat.”</p><p>His eyebrows shot up. “You’ve been speaking with Tom, I see. No doubt having a laugh at my expense.”</p><p>Hermione shrugged. “Not at all. I haven’t spoken with Tom in months.”</p><p>Abraxas’ brows drew forward, eyes narrowing, but he said nothing. </p><p>He led her around the room, her shimmering tulle skirt twirling around her dainty feet, like a dark queen bathed in starlight.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Winnie’s eyes widened as she watched Abraxas Malfoy and Hermione Dumbledore waltz. To her, Dumbledore’s daughter was a celebrity. Winnie admired her style, her confidence, her power and the way she articulated and carried herself. In addition to all of these things, she was in awe of Hermione’s ambition and enterprise. If Winifred desired to emulate anyone, it was Hermione Dumbledore. </p><p>She wasn’t alone. The entire ballroom eyed Hermione. Photographers persisted in flashing their enchanted cameras, capturing the various angles of Hermione and Abraxas together, hoping to capture a look or a touch, anything they might use to paint a picture of blossoming romance in the papers come Monday. </p><p>Winifred hadn’t intended to come, but knowing that Hermione would be here was an incentive she couldn’t turn down. When her brother had informed her of what Hermione had proposed at their meeting the previous week, Winnie had hardly been able to believe it. Hermione Dumbledore, an investor in her factory? In her potions?</p><p>Hermione planned to purchase half of the factory, to pay for the repairs, equipment, and ingredients, to cover the costs of manufacturing, <em> and </em> to fund Winnie’s research of new potion formulas.</p><p>It was everything Winnie had dreamed of. She could scarcely begin to believe it could become a reality. </p><p>Nothing but hardship had befallen her family since she’d been a young witch. To imagine that their luck could turn now seemed like a cruel joke.</p><p>Even her love life had been filled with pain and heartache. Edward had been too good to be true.</p><p>Winnie wouldn’t have braved seeing him tonight if it weren’t for Hermione.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>After the dance, Hermione had run into the Potters and stood chatting happily with them, when she finally spotted Tom. He stood across the room, surrounded by ministry officials, whom he seemed to be conversing seriously with. </p><p>Hermione wondered what the topic of conversation was. She had a feeling she knew.</p><p>She wondered if he indeed had something to do with the breaches. She hoped not.</p><p>Since he seemed quite engrossed in his discussion, she took the opportunity to admire him unimpeded. She almost didn’t recognize him at first, because he wore his hair differently. It was cut shorter than usual and was slicked back dashingly, and he looked every bit like a film star. She couldn’t tell which way she preferred it… he looked devilishly handsome either way.</p><p>He stood a head above the rest, and she almost let out a burst of laughter as she realized their choice of attire was perfectly coordinated. He wore a sharply tailored black velvet suit, with embroidery around the collar. The sheen of the velvet contrasted subtly with the black of his shirt and silk tie. A black mask obscured the left half of his face, and she noted that he still did not wear his Gaunt ring. She found herself rather surprised that he’d opted for a more muggle style of clothing for the ball, rather than the usual dress robes like the rest of the wizards in attendance.</p><p>It made him stand out, as if he didn’t stand out enough.</p><p>Her heart sped up, stomach turning flips.</p><p>“Oh, here they are!” said Euphemia Potter, motioning to a blonde couple leaving the dance floor. “Hermione, you’ve already met Tobias Haywood. I would like to introduce you to his younger sister, Miss Winifred Haywood!”</p><p>“Oh, do call me Winnie, please, Miss Dumbledore,” the blonde witch said breathlessly, partly from the waltz and partly due to nerves. “It’s so marvelous  to meet you.”</p><p>“Likewise,” Hermione said, taking the witch’s proffered hand. “I do <em> so </em> look forward to getting to know you, Miss Haywood. We are to be in business together, it seems.” Hermione winked.</p><p>Winifred caught her breath, her excitement and disbelief rising like a tidal wave in her chest. </p><p>They chitchatted about the factory, discussing theories of the best methods of brewing, and the Potters watched it all amiably. Soon, Eulessia Baron joined the mix, having been designated as the Prophet’s press representative for the ball. </p><p>“I can’t wait to join the <em> Chronomancer </em> ,” she muttered to Hermione under her breath. “Things are simply awful over at the <em> Prophet </em> now. The reporting is all politically influenced, and if Carrow doesn’t like your take, she scraps it entirely. It’s a complete farce of a paper now.”</p><p>Hermione was tittering with excitement about her new paper, but she reminded Eulessia to keep it quiet. </p><p>Minister Moon was in attendance, and kissed both of Hermione’s cheeks, congratulating her on her spellbook, and her new career as an auror.</p><p>“There’s no limits for you, my dear,” he murmured under his breath, his eyes locked with Hermione’s seriously. “You are your father’s daughter. A true force of this century. Never forget it.”</p><p>Hermione’s eyes shone as tears collected along her waterline. She blinked them away, thanking him. </p><p>The Weasleys were in attendance, and Hermione spotted Cedrella’s sister, Callidora, whom she had met in Plovdiv at the convention. She was on the arm of her husband, Harfang Longbottom, and Hermione caught her eye and bowed her head respectfully. The Black sister returned the gesture, and Hermione thought she caught the smallest upturn of her lips.</p><p>Abraxas returned to her side, his eyes taking in the mixed company guardedly. At his side was a very special witch indeed.</p><p>“May I present Celestina Warbeck?” he muttered with a smile. “I believe she needs no introduction.”</p><p>The witch was a vision, her dark skin contrasted against her brilliant gold and blue robes. She flashed a gleaming smile, and responded in her throaty voice, “I’ve been dying to meet the famed Hermione Dumbledore.”</p><p>Hermione’s eyes widened and she stuttered. “M-me?”</p><p>Ceslestina nodded eagerly, taking Hermione’s hand affectionately. “Your articles inspired me so greatly that I donated all of the proceeds from my latest tour to the Muggle Awareness Fund. I hope maybe one day we can team up for an event, perhaps a fundraiser. I’d love nothing better than to work with you to do some good around here! Let’s talk about having dinner at my home sometime.”</p><p>Hermione was at a loss for words for once. “I- I’m absolutely floored. That would be a dream come true, Miss Warbeck.”</p><p>Abraxas chuckled under his breath. “It seems Hermione is finally starstruck. Where are the cameras when you need them?”</p><p>As if summoned, there was a bright flash and the sound of a shutter clacking. </p><p>“Right on time,” Eulessia laughed with a roll of her eyes. </p><p>Winifred stayed very quiet, but her eyes followed Hermione’s movements, taking in every word she uttered. </p><p>Hermione caught sight of Minister Tuft from across the room, surrounded by a group of very powerful international leaders. She was garbed in a brilliant red dress, her lips coated with the same cherry red lipstick. Feathers jutted out from her sparkling ruby mask. </p><p>It was then that Hermione’s eyes wandered, and finally, they connected with a pair of eyes, ones that she knew quite well. </p><p>Tom’s dark pools of obsidian held her hostage, dragging down her body and back up to meet her gaze, framed by dark lashes behind a black mask.</p><p>Hermione’s lips parted as the air escaped her lungs, and in that instant, Tom’s lips curled into a lethal grin, and he winked.</p><p>With a sharp intake of breath and a lurch in her stomach, Hermione looked away.</p><p>She turned back to Abraxas, only to find him staring at her, his silver eyes sharp with suspicion.</p><p>“Will you excuse me for a few moments?” she murmured to him, out of earshot. “I think I’ll go take a turn in the gardens.”</p><p>“Shall I accompany you?” He replied, eyes still narrowed with suspicion.</p><p>Hermione thought for a moment, but she decided that the memories she intended to revisit were best done in solitude. “No, Mr. Malfoy. That won’t be necessary.”</p><p>He stared at her a moment longer, but finally relented, seeming more than a little pleased to be free of the current company.</p><p>Hermione excused herself and turned, making her way to the balcony. </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>The halls of Malfoy Manor were open to guests, allowing for attendees to browse its opulence at their leisure. Winifred had disengaged herself from her brother when he’d run into some of his old school friends, taking the opportunity to soothe her social anxiety by wandering the splendorous art galleries of the mansion. </p><p>She’d never been to Malfoy Manor, nor any of the famed homes of the pureblood dynasties. How resplendent it must have been, she thought to herself, to have grown up in such a place!</p><p>Her family had always come from some hardship. It seemed to almost be a curse upon her ancestry, to struggle financially. For a time, they’d known plenty, when the factory had been at its height and they’d had an exclusive contract with Sleekeazy’s. But all in the course of six months, the Potters had sold their company, and her father fell ill.</p><p>It wasn’t the Potters’ fault, but they seemed to feel that it was, and they were doing everything in their power to make up for it.</p><p>Winifred walked the wall of the gallery, marveling at the beauty of the magical portraits, the statues whose eyes moved, following her, and the busts of various renowned wizards and the ancestors of the Malfoy line.</p><p>She reached out a hand to trace the fluid contours of a golden bust… one formed from a rare alchemical substance, she was sure, having studied it at length in her potioneering research. </p><p>She suddenly imagined Edward as a boy in a place like this, running along its magnificent hallways in his childhood, being reared with the best of the best, born with a silver spoon in his mouth, instilled with a sense of irrefutable superiority.</p><p>How desperately she had loved him. </p><p>How foolish she had been to ignore the iron bars of the wizarding caste system.</p><p>It was an unbreachable wall between her and Edward.</p><p><em> But even Azkaban was penetrated, </em> a voice whispered. <em> Fate always finds a way… </em></p><p>But not for her. Not for them.</p><p>Edward Rosier was not her fate.</p><p>Winifred welcomed the thought of running the factory, of brewing her own draughts and tinctures. She welcomed the distraction as much as the opportunity. She would make her own way, and he would regret the day he left.</p><p>“Well, well, well,” came a deep voice from behind her.</p><p>She startled, jerking back her hand from the bust and spinning around, her heart leaping into her throat.</p><p>Speak of the devil…</p><p>Edward Rosier stood in the open archway to the gallery, in a crimson suit and a mask with horns emerging from his dark brown curls. </p><p>He gazed at Winifred, his eyes slowly perusing the silver dress draped over her form, the crown of braids atop of head, the nervous jumping of her jugular.</p><p>“What are you doing here, Win?”</p><p>She blinked, lifting her hands to anxiously spin her silver ring on her finger. “I was invited. I came with the Potters.”</p><p>He snorted. “With your brother.”</p><p>“Corelius asked me, you knob.”</p><p>His chin lifted. “Did he now?”</p><p>She nodded, her eyes fixed on the blood red rose pinned to his lapel. She daren’t look him in the eye.</p><p>He started walking toward her, slowly, deliberately. His wand was out and the doors shut behind him. </p><p>Winnie backed away, step for step, until her back hit the wall of the gallery with finality. </p><p>His lips turned up in a smirk. “<em> Immobilis </em>.”</p><p>“Edward,” she muttered cautiously as he approached her. She couldn’t leave or move; her muscles were locked.“What are you doing?”</p><p>“You.”</p><p>“Like hell you are.”</p><p>He chuckled. “Always so much spunk. I’m quite fond of taming you.”</p><p>“You no longer have that right.”</p><p>“No?” His chocolate brown eyes were dark and intense. “Will you tell me no, Winifred?”</p><p>“I will.”</p><p>His eyes roamed her face, her body, the expanse of her milky skin, before they lifted and locked with her seafoam green eyes, light beneath her pale lashes. Then his gaze dropped to fix on her lips. </p><p>“Why do you dress like an angel, Win? Do you think yourself innocent?” His voice was deep and threatening.</p><p>She scoffed. “You’ve stolen my innocence, Edward.”</p><p>His eyes narrowed, and he lifted his hand to brush the back of his knuckles against her cheek. “I suppose it’s an even trade. Your innocence for my happiness.”</p><p>Her face twisted into an expression of disgust. “I’ve stolen <em> nothing </em> from you. You have everything and I have nothing.”</p><p>He watched her, and his eyes were both cold and hot. His gaze, both a glare and a prayer. </p><p>Again, he trailed his eyes over her gown. He dropped his hand to her shoulder, dragging his fingertips down her arm gently. He watched her face as he touched her, and though her eyes were fixed on some point over his shoulder, he could see the violent beating of her blood through her jugular vein, and the trembling of her lips.</p><p>He inhaled sharply, and then kissed her. Winifred had no choice but to let him, and though she would have liked to bring her arms up around his neck, she was still immobilized.</p><p>His scent was both toxic and comforting all at once. Her body flooded with heat, every nerve ending aflame from his soft touches ghosting her skin.</p><p>He broke away, but their lips still touched, his hot breath falling against her lips as she whispered, “Please. Please don’t.”</p><p>He closed his eyes. Hard. “Win,” he whispered.</p><p>“Please don’t,” she pleaded. </p><p>He opened both eyes, his mouth twisting into a cruel snarl. He reached for her waist and ripped her away from the wall, pressing her tightly against him as he jerked her dress up.</p><p>“Edward, please. Here? Now?”</p><p>“Here. Now.”</p><p>“Will you rape me?”</p><p>He exhaled sharply through his nose. “Are you telling me no?” His fingers dug into her flesh. “Are you, Winnie?”</p><p>She swallowed, her bravado lost. “But… the paintings will see.” </p><p>He laughed under his breath. “Then I suppose the paintings will see what a whore you are for pureblood cock.”</p><p>Her answering smile was cold. “I think they’ll be more shocked by a pureblood wizard being hard for a half-blood.”</p><p>He laughed again, and leaned in to whisper in her ear. “I don’t think they’ll be so shocked by that, my dear. You clearly know very little of how these families work.”</p><p>“I hope I never find out. I’d sooner give up my magic than be a part of such a disgusting group of bigots.”</p><p>Rosier’s smile faded into a rage-filled scowl. “Don’t lie, Winnie. You wanted it. The wealth and the prestige-“</p><p>“I wanted <em> you </em>!” she screamed, cutting him off. “I don’t need your wealth. I’ll make my own way-“</p><p>“You wanted it because you’re family is poor-“</p><p>“I wanted you to <em> care </em>!” </p><p>Rosier seethed, but watched her in silence.</p><p>Tears threatened to spill over her eyes, coating her bottom lashes. “I wanted you to care about everything I’ve been through.. what my family has been through. I wanted you to care about my well-being. I wanted your encouragement. Your support. But now I know who you really are, you and your friends. You’re not who I thought you were.”</p><p>“You just want to manipulate me.”</p><p>“If that’s true, why are you seeking <em> me </em> out? I’ve left you alone.”</p><p>“You came here tonight <em> knowing </em> I would be here!”</p><p>“And yet I still came… to help my family. You’d know it if you cared at all… if you asked me a damn thing about my life but all you ever wanted from me was… was…” She sighed and broke away. “You took everything from me.”</p><p>He watched her for some time, torn, at war with himself. “What’s this about Dumbledore’s daughter?”</p><p>“It doesn’t matter. You don’t care.”</p><p>“Tell me, Winnie.”</p><p>“I don’t have to.”</p><p>“I want to know.”</p><p>Winifred swallowed, her eyes cutting to him. “She’s bought my family’s factory. She’s going to invest in my business… and I’m going to run it.”</p><p>He watched her for a moment, then released her waist and pressed her against the wall. Their eyes met and silence stretched between them for several moments. </p><p>“You shouldn’t be running a business,” he muttered disdainfully. </p><p>“Why not?” she asked angrily.</p><p>He shook his head, refusing to answer.</p><p>“Nothing is good enough for you, is it?”</p><p>His eyes snapped back to her, filled with hatred. “I can still take care of you, Winnie. I just can’t marry you.”</p><p>Tears finally fell onto Winnie’s cheeks. “You thought you’d marry your pureblood wife and keep me on the side. Your little strumpet. That’s what you thought, isn’t it?”</p><p>He sighed, but said nothing.</p><p>“I’m going to tell you something right now, Edward. I may be quiet and shy, but I’m not weak. The next man I fuck will have a pair of balls. Not some pureblood prick who’s afraid to make his own decisions.” She heaved a deep breath of indignation, her cheeks red with anger. “And I <em> will </em> marry someone who cares about me. Someone who’s proud of me, not ashamed of me.” She cast a scathing look at him, up and down. “Someone who isn’t afraid.”</p><p>He closed his eyes again. “You wouldn’t get what you want, Winifred. If I marry you, my father will disown me. We’d have nothing. You’d get nothing.”</p><p>“If I thought we could cut ties with your wealth <em> and </em> family, I would marry you in a heartbeat,” she breathed tremulously. “I don’t want it, Edward. I want <em> you </em>. Only you.”</p><p>He swallowed, lips twisted into an expression of hidden pain. His eyes scorched her, burning her like the flames of a funeral pyre, mournful in their heat. He waved his wand, releasing her from his spell.</p><p>He cocked his head as he gazed at her, then murmured, “Say I can fuck you.”</p><p>She returned his stare in silence, but he saw the slight shaking of her chest, where her heart pounded violently. </p><p>His fingers tightened on her hips, biting into her flesh. He knew they would leave bruises. Her pale skin was prone to them, and that’s how he liked it. “Say I can fuck you, Winifred.”</p><p>She sucked in a sharp breath, then nodded.</p><p>That’s all he needed.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Wilhelmina Tuft eyed Hermione Dumbledore from across the room. She was surrounded by an odd assembling of witches and wizards.</p><p>The Potters, an odd and eccentric couple, but pureblood nonetheless. A young witch with dark skin whom Tuft recognized as a press agent from the Daily Prophet. A young man and woman with pale blonde hair. The ginger-haired Septimus Weasley, a self-professed muggle activist, and his blood traitor wife. </p><p>Hermione lit up as she was introduced to Celestina Warbeck. Tuft decided she hated them both. </p><p>She had thrown back her flute of champagne and was reaching for another, when she spotted her husband in a corner of the room, chatting up one of the DMLE’s young interns, Miss Parkinson.</p><p>He knew better than to be indiscreet with his pursuits in public.</p><p>Still, Tuft’s eyes narrowed as she watched the girl giggling.</p><p>Tuft felt vomit rising in her throat but she swallowed it back.</p><p>Her eyes found Tom Riddle. He was sleek and sharp as a blade, and having what appeared to be quite an amusing conversation with Minister Moon. She watched as Tom’s eyes lifted and searched the room. </p><p>They fixed on Hermione. </p><p>Wilhelmina followed his line of sight. Hermione was disengaging from her group and escaping onto the ballroom veranda, slipping through the thick set of drapes hanging over the archway. </p><p>Tuft watched Tom’s gaze, which was intensely locked on her retreating form, then cleared just as quickly as his eyes flicked back to the Minister’s former financial advisor. </p><p>Tuft was positive he was also disengaging himself. </p><p>Tuft’s eyes flicked over to the far end of the room, catching the eyes of Maximilian Dolohov. </p><p>The corner of his lips turned up, and he gave a barely perceptible nod.</p>

</p><p><br/>Dolohov watched as Tom made his way along the outer edges of the ballroom, like a shadow wraith attempting to avoid notice.</p><p>He observed as Tom lingered in front of the heavy drapes concealing the terrace’s exit. Tom’s eyes swept the ballroom for several moments, glinting red in the dim candlelight,  and then he slipped through the curtains as swiftly as a serpent, with all the incorporeality of a ghost.</p><p>Dolohov crossed over to where the Blacks stood, alongside the Malfoys and Lestranges. He squeezed by Callidora and Walburga’s parents, nodding his greetings and kissing the hand of Abraxas Malfoy’s domineering mother, whom he fondly referred to as Mother Malfoy.</p><p>He set eyes on Walburga, who wore an emerald-toned green gown, her generous bust on display, with an obscene-looking jewel nestled against her daring décolletage. He almost grinned at her, but was stopped by the sight of her hand resting on the robes of Orion Black. </p><p>Dolohov cleared his throat as he neared. “Miss Black, good evening. You’re looking quite well.” He glanced at Orion. “May I borrow your charming fiancé for a moment? I believe someone was asking after her.”</p><p>Orion shrugged and handed her over, passing her hand from one arm to the next.</p><p>“I appreciate the rescue,” she murmured softly as they walked away.</p><p>“You can thank me later,” he said suggestively. “For now, I think you may want to inform that photographer over there,” he said, pointing at a squat, balding man across the room, “that he may find Hermione Dumbledore in <em> interesting </em> company out on the balcony.”</p><p>Walburga’s eyes grew wide and she glanced at the photographer, then at the curtains. She immediately turned to retreat, but he caught her by the arm. </p><p>“Be sure to show him the staircase to the upper level balcony.” He winked, giving her a malevolent grin. “For an aerial view.”</p><p>“Is that all?” she asked, an eyebrow lifted questioningly. “I mean…” She swallowed. “She <em> is </em> here, after all. If we wanted to bring her to <em> the Eye </em>-“</p><p>“That’s all,” he interrupted. “For tonight. One step at a time, my love. We must tread <em> carefully </em> when dealing with the most poisonous serpent in the forest… and his <em> lady fair. </em>”</p><p>Walburga’s blue eyes narrowed, and she curtseyed before backing away and approaching the man with the enchanted camera across the room.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Tom stood for a brief moment as he appeared on the other side of the curtains, admiring the silhouette of his witch against the moonlit gardens beyond. The night was crisp and cool, not yet warm and balmy, and the stars appeared as myriad brilliant flares of white light in the spring sky. Hermione faded into them like Asteria, the goddess of the stars, the flickering jewels in her black dress blending into the night like a celestial gradient.</p><p>She was facing away from him, and he blinked, drawing in a deep breath, hesitant to pull her from her reverie.</p><p>
<em> Was she remembering their almost kiss upon this very balcony a year ago? </em>
</p><p>“I should have kissed you,” he pronounced as he crossed the stone veranda and came to stand at her side.</p><p>He’d expected to startle her, but she didn’t seem surprised as she slowly turned to gaze up at him. He imagined that she might have felt his presence, or sensed him coming.</p><p>“What?” she asked softly, eyeing him as he pulled his cigarettes from his coat. </p><p>“Last year. On this balcony. I would’ve kissed you if I'd known what’s good for me.” He gazed at her, frustrated by the mask which covered her features. His eyes flicked downward. “You’re like devil's snare in that dress.”</p><p>She looked down at her dress, somewhat self-consciously.</p><p>“Why do you say that?” </p><p>He lit a cigarette wandlessly and sucked the smoke deep into his lungs. “Because you’ve ensnared the devil it seems.”</p><p>She snorted, quite an unladylike action for one wearing such an elegant gown. “The devil surely knows what he is. <em> You </em>, however, keep pretending not to be what you are.”</p><p>His jaw tensed. “How can I, if I don’t know what I’ve done to warrant such a title?”</p><p>“You’ve done enough already to deserve it.”</p><p>He cocked his head with a smirk.“That’s quite true, to be fair.”</p><p>Silence stretched between them, save for the hum of tension between their bodies, an electric current sizzling and snapping like a metal wire being struck by lightning.</p><p>“You look beautiful tonight.”</p><p>She took a deep breath, then turned to look at him. “Thank you. You look fit as well… but you look tired.”</p><p>“I am tired. I don’t sleep well without you next to me.”</p><p>Hermione didn’t respond, but continued to gaze out at the hedge maze, coldly lit by the opal moon.</p><p>He took another drag, then breathed as he expelled the smoke, “Come back to me.”</p><p>She was quiet for a moment, as if contemplating. “No.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“You know why.”</p><p>“Can nothing be forgiven? Is your heart made of stone, Hermione?” His jaw muscles flexed in frustration. “Or did you lie when you said you loved me?”</p><p>“I didn’t lie.”</p><p>“Then come back to me.”</p><p>Hermione sighed. “Love isn’t always enough, Tom.”</p><p>“You’re wrong about that. Love is everything.”</p><p>Hermione let out a bark of laughter, a disbelieving “ha!” as she shook her head. “How strange to hear you say that. The version of you that <em> I </em> knew never loved a day in his life and didn’t care to.”</p><p>He laughed through his nose. “Then it should strike you as very ironic, I would think. You should know better than anyone the impact you’ve had upon my heart, little witch.”</p><p>Hermione swallowed. He turned to her, and it reminded her of the last Ostara when he’d nearly kissed her. His scent flooded her senses the same way it had then, dizzying her. He reached up and ran his knuckles gently along her shoulder blade. She could feel his eyes on her. </p><p>He took a deep breath, and dropped his hand.</p><p>“Dumbledore and Dufresne… dating. That’s what the headlines say,” he muttered caustically.</p><p>“Since when have the headlines ever been right about anything?” </p><p>He tilted his head. “‘Drag you back by your hair.’ That’s what I told you I would do if you ever tried to leave me… and look at me. You, <em> my dear </em> , are enough to test the patience of even the most <em> long suffering </em> of wizards. I’ve given you plenty of space, I think. Have I not?”</p><p>“How generous of you.”</p><p>He was quiet for a moment, as he flicked away the ash from his cigarette. “So is it true?”</p><p>“Is what true?”</p><p>A pause. “What the papers say.”</p><p>Her lips curved upward slightly. “You’re jealous, aren’t you?”</p><p>He took another drag, the end of the cigarette blazing red in the darkness. “Very jealous, my love… and you know what happens when I get jealous, don’t you?”</p><p>Her smile fell, and her head snapped to the side. She glared at him as she whispered, “You won’t touch him.”</p><p>His eyes narrowed. “Do you really believe that?”</p><p>She swallowed. “If you do it, you’ll wind up in Azkaban and I’ll make sure of it.”</p><p>He grinned, his distracting lips pulling back over his brilliant white teeth and Hermione could hardly ignore the way it made her chest tighten. “Nevermind that Azkaban couldn’t hold me… do you really think I can’t kill someone and get away with it? Come on, darling. You know better than that. You once called me a genius, remember?” He breathed out more smoke. “I’ve done it before.”</p><p>She looked at him coldly. “I’m aware.”</p><p>His eyebrows shot up. “Are you?”</p><p>She narrowed her eyes. “Yes. I know you’re a murderer, Tom. I know you killed your own bloody father.”</p><p>He laughed. “On the contrary. He wasn’t bloody. I used the killing curse. Quick and clean. Better than he deserved.”</p><p>He watched her visibly tense, struck by the coldness of his statement.</p><p>“Of course, there’s something you don’t know, I’ll wager.”</p><p>She crossed her arms. “What’s that?”</p><p>“That your pretty hands are the only ones that can stay my wrath. I’ll do anything for my soulmate.”</p><p>Hermione froze, eyes wide. “What did you say?”</p><p>His lips curled into another grin. “You heard me, little witch.”</p><p>He noticed the way her breath caught, how her hands started to tremble. “What made you say that?”</p><p>He took a step toward her, and it took everything within Hermione not to also take a step. She was drawn to him like a magnet, despite her simmering anger. </p><p>He took another step, tentatively, as if she were a skittish animal. Then, when he stood before her, gazing down at her, he lifted one hand to cup her chin and ran his thumb over her bottom lip. “Do you know how desperately I’ve wanted to touch you? My heart has ached terribly in your absence, Hermione.” </p><p>“Why did you call me your soulmate, Tom?”</p><p>His eyes searched her face. He wondered if his eyes were still red, or if they were pools of blackness, swallowing her whole. “You know it, don’t you? Without my telling you. You know that you’re my soulmate.”</p><p>She turned away, attempting to break the powerful hold he seemed to have on her. Tom could sense that her rage had dissipated with the previous months, and she now tried to build a wall between them, but even he could tell that it was crumbling steadily. “Even if it is true... It doesn’t matter. The only thing that matters is your actions, and they’re vile, Tom.”</p><p>“What actions are those?”</p><p>She shut her mouth.</p><p>He laughed through his nose, shaking his head. “You still won’t tell me the truth… about what I’ve done. About the future. Do you think that’s fair?”</p><p>She lowered her eyes. “No, I don’t. But does it really matter if we aren’t together?”</p><p>“It matters to me. It’s only fair that I be given a chance to right my wrongs.” His eyes fell closed for a moment, then he blinked them open. His sharp cheekbones rippled with frustration. “Can you honestly see yourself with someone else, Hermione?”</p><p>Her lips parted, breath coming in shallow crests. “No,” she said, swallowing thickly. “But I can’t see myself with you, either. I’m terrified of the thought.”</p><p>“Lies.” He flicked away his cigarette and smiled, the half of his mouth not obscured by the mask lifting slightly. “Shall I give you a peek into my mind? Because you and I are all that I can see.”</p><p>She gazed at him for a moment, searching his face , then she suddenly moved closer, and reached up to take off his mask, disturbing his perfect hair slightly. She held it in her hands, her fingers stroking its contours, but her eyes never left his face.</p><p>He reached out and took her hands in his, then gently extricated the mask from her grip and tossed it into the gardens below. “My mask is off, Hermione. When will you take yours off?”</p><p> </p><hr/><p><br/>Hermione’s lips parted and she exhaled all at once, her gaze locked on the hand that held hers. </p><p>She slowly turned her hand in his, then threaded her fingers into his longer ones. In response, he tightened his grip, and lifted her hand to press his lips to the inner part of her wrist. His thumb stroked her skin softly. </p><p>“Hermione,” he whispered, and her gaze lifted slowly, as if she couldn’t fight the pull. Their eyes met, and it was as if some magical cord between them pulled tight, knocking the wind from their lungs.</p><p>Her eyes grew wide as she pressed into the feeling, letting herself feel the whirling, crackling forcefield of magic that whipped about them. It was as if they were both one entity, forming the eye of a hurricane.</p><p>At the same time, all was quiet, and Hermione felt as if she were existing on two alternate planes at once, each the antithesis of the other.</p><p>Perhaps she was.</p><p>She knew he could feel it. The circling dance of their magic. But he stood very still, letting her breathe in the air, giving her time, reigning himself in. </p><p>After a moment, the corner of his lips turned up, and he pulled ever so slightly on her hand, bringing her closer. </p><p>She sucked in a nervous breath, but didn’t pull away. Her feet moved forward a step, until they stood toe to toe.</p><p>“Will you deny me a kiss tonight?”</p><p>She swallowed, her breath releasing in halting degrees. “If you kiss me… I’ll be trapped.”</p><p>He cocked his head, his brows furrowed. “Trapped… by a <em> kiss </em>?”</p><p>“I know I won’t be able to think about anything but that kiss… and I’ll be shackled to you once more.”</p><p>He ran his tongue over his teeth, eyeing her searchingly. “Would that be so bad? You’ve had me in chains since this night a year ago.”</p><p>He leaned forward slowly, releasing her hand and reaching around to slide his fingers into her hair, gripping the back of her head. </p><p>She felt his nose brush her ear as he whispered, “I love you.” </p><p>His lips met her temple, then pressed softly along her jawline. “Don’t stop me,” he whispered, his breath hot against her cheek.</p><p>Then, he kissed her.</p><p>The kiss was soft and warm, his hand firmly holding her head steady as he slanted his mouth across hers, a silent demand that she open her mouth to him.</p><p>He didn’t need to demand it. She parted her lips, and his tongue found purchase, seeking hers out with ferocity and hunger. As soon as their tongues met, Hermione let out a soft sound, not a sigh or a whimper, but something in between. Tom sucked in his breath sharply through his nose at the sound, which sent his pulse speeding through his veins.</p><p>Tom let out a growl under his breath, a deep rumbling sound in his chest, and his other arm slipped around her waist to tighten her body against his. </p><p>He kissed her hard as his hand slid up her back, stroking the bare skin between her shoulder blades. At the familiar sensation of his body against hers, almost a feeling of coming home, Hermione sighed. </p><p>She broke away briefly. “Tom,” she whispered shakily. </p><p>“Shh,” he replied, and then kissed her again, moving his hand from the back of her head to her cheek, tracing its curve with his fingertips .</p><p>Suddenly, there was a brilliant flash of light from somewhere above them, and the sound of a shutter snapping.</p><p>Tom ripped away from her instantly and looked up, seeking the source of the flash. Hermione followed his line of sight just in time to catch a glimpse of a photographer slinking back from the balustrade of the balcony on the upper level.</p><p>“Tom!” she shouted, backing away. “Did you do this?”</p><p>His brow furrowed and he looked at her as if she’d gone daft. “Bloody hell, Hermione. Of <em> course </em> not!”</p><p>He tipped his head back to cast one more look at the perpetrator before he began to take off running. Then, he stopped short. Turning back, he muttered under his breath to Hermione, “Meet me in the library. I need to talk to you.”</p><p>She gave him an exasperated look, but he didn’t give her time to argue before he ran after the photographer, whipping out his wand as he took the stone stairs two at a time.</p><p>Hermione’s heart rate refused to slow, but she couldn’t tell whether it was fear, or adrenaline, or the effects of the kiss. </p>

<h2 class="heading">Through the Floo</h2>
</div>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Hermione browsed the library of Malfoy Manor, waiting for Tom. The library was dark save for a few magically lit torches, and the low dancing of the flames in the fireplace. The few portraits hanging along the walls were asleep, but they still made her anxious; she’d never trust the Malfoys, nor their portraits. She laid her hand against her gossamer skirt, ensuring that her wand was still in place in the holster strapped to her thigh. </p><p>She was too nervous to look at the books lining the shelves, so she took a seat on what looked to be a Queen Anne sofa in front of the fireplace. She ran her fingers along the carved wood frame, thinking to herself that it likely wasn’t Queen Anne, but she wasn’t abreast of the styles and trends of wizarding furnishings. She’d bought all of her decor from muggle designers.</p><p>The sounds of the ball reached her as distant echoes… the voice of Celestina Warbeck crooning… the low hum of voices and the tinkle of laughter… Hermione’s heart beat rapidly, and she began to bite her nails in apprehension. She hoped Malfoy wasn’t looking for her.</p><p>She hadn’t intended to cave so easily to Tom, but there had been something quite sincere about his words. It hadn’t been his typical charming act, but a string of confessions that rolled off his tongue with the ease of a man speaking pure truth. </p><p>He loved her. Hermione believed it.</p><p>
<em> But was he good for her? </em>
</p><p>With one breath he confessed his devotion, and with the next, he uttered death threats and spoke whimsically of murder.</p><p>Hermione leaned her head against the sofa’s back, wishing she had a drink. </p><p>She wasn’t even sure <em> why </em> she’d decided to come here and wait for him. Hermione felt she was being sucked back into a vortex, a black hole that would swallow her whole.</p><p>She thought of the kiss. Of his hands stroking her skin, of his stomach pressed to her chest. The way she’d had to strain on her tiptoes to return his kiss, which was passionate despite the fact that she knew he was restraining himself.</p><p>She’d done it now. Tom was a worse addiction than euphoria elixir. She felt as though relenting to that kiss was a kind of relapse, and now she was terrified that she would be even more addicted than she was before.</p><p>
<em> Can nothing be forgiven? </em>
</p><p>
<em> You should know better than anyone the impact you’ve had upon my heart, little witch. </em>
</p><p>Part of her had worried that he was manipulating her. Using her to gain information about the future. Voldemort had been ever present in Hermione’s mind, tainting her image of Tom. She’d convinced herself that any dalliance they had would be ended eventually, that his true colors would come out at some point, and then she’d have a reason to kill him.</p><p>But that hadn’t happened. </p><p>
<em> Your pretty hands are the only ones that can stay my wrath.  </em>
</p><p>She heard his whisper against her ear, feverish and laced with desire.</p><p>
<em> I love you. </em>
</p><p>Hermione sighed, knowing she was fucked.</p><p>“I’m fucked,” she breathed.</p><p>Not only because she desperately missed Tom Riddle, but because now the whole wizarding world would know it.</p><p>She started suddenly and stood at the sound of the heavy library doors being opened. A beam of light streamed in and then disappeared as Tom walked through and closed the doors behind him.</p><p>“You came,” he muttered, as if he hadn’t really believed she’d have waited for him there. “I thought I might have to drag you out of your flat by your hair.”</p><p>“Very funny,” she whispered.</p><p>He stood fixed just within the library doors, gazing at her for several moments before he crossed the room.</p><p>“They got away from me. Apparently they slipped out through the press floo before I reached them, but I promise you, I will find out who’s responsible.”</p><p>Hermione gave him a tight smile, feeling absolutely mortified.</p><p>He cleared his throat. “Is it that terrible that people would know about us?”</p><p>Hermione sighed. “I don’t even know what’s <em> happening </em> with us, Tom. Do you think I want the interference of the entire wizarding world? Not to mention the fact that we are <em> supposed </em> to be enemies.”</p><p>Tom grinned devilishly and winked at her. “Enemies to lovers. They’ll eat it up.”</p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes, and lifted a hand to rub her forehead as if she had a headache.</p><p>Tom looked her up and down once, and then muttered, “As much as I’d love to continue our romantic interlude, I have more pressing things to discuss with you.”</p><p>She looked up, already exhausted. “What is it?”</p><p>“I want you to quit your job.”</p><p>Her eyes widened, and her mouth fell open. “Oh, <em> here </em> we go-“</p><p>“Because I want you to run for Minister for Magic.”</p><p>She cocked her head, her expression one of incredulity. “Have you gone <em> absolutely </em> daft?”</p><p>He whipped out his cigarettes and lit one. “I plan to run, myself.”</p><p>She stared at him, blinking, for a minute. “Tom,” she began slowly. “I’m sure you’re aware that there is <em> already </em> a Minister in place.”</p><p>He nodded as he breathed in smoke.</p><p>“You should stop smoking those.”</p><p>He pulled the cigarette out of his mouth and expelled the smoke, the corners of his lips turning up slightly. “Perhaps I may let you convince me… if you’d stop running from me, that is.”</p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes and folded her arms, leaning back against the elaborate stone statue framing the fireplace. “The <em> Minister </em>, Tom?”</p><p>He nodded. “Right. I plan to kill her.”</p><p>Hermione promptly pushed off from the stone. “<em> What </em>?”</p><p>“You heard me.”</p><p>Her mouth dropped open in absolute horror and shock. She moved closer, lowering her voice. </p><p> “You <em> cannot </em> kill the minister, Tom.”</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>She sputtered. “B-<em> because </em>! Are you absolutely off your rocker?”</p><p>His lips slowly curved into a smile, his eyes roaming her face with an expression akin to adoration.</p><p>She backed away. “Don’t look at me like that.”</p><p>He brought the cigarette back to his lips jauntily, holding back laughter, and spoke around the cigarette in his mouth, “Like what, little witch?”</p><p>She looked around, eyeing the paintings. “We cannot talk about this here.”</p><p>He tilted his head, following her line of sight. “My flat?”</p><p>She gave him an exasperated look.</p><p>“Your choice.”</p><p>She shook her head, resigned. “I suppose the night is already over for me, anyway,” she huffed. “But I should say something to Abraxas, though.”</p><p>“I’ll give him your apologies. Let’s go.”</p><p>He vanished his half-smoked cigarette, then walked forward and took her hand, leading her back to the fireplace. He grabbed a handful of floo powder. </p><p>“Your flat is connected to this fireplace?” she asked, surprised. It didn’t seem like something he would allow. </p><p>“It only lets me through,” he said. “How do you think I get here so early to study in the mornings?”</p><p>He threw the powder into the fire and the flames flared bright green. Then, he tugged her hand as he led her through.</p><p> </p><hr/><p><br/>As soon as they exited the fireplace in his flat, she stood back, ripped her hand away, and yanked up her skirt to grab her wand. She cast a cleaning charm on herself, scourgifying the ash and soot and then slid her wand back into its holster.</p><p>He, of course, stood with lips quirked, ogling the expanse of her thigh and calf open to his gaze until she dropped her skirt again.</p><p>“Like what you see?” she asked sarcastically.</p><p>His eyes narrowed and he tilted his head. “I’m not sure. Show me again.”</p><p>She rolled her eyes. “Tom, you cannot kill the Minister. You can’t just kill people.”</p><p>He sighed, ejecting a breath sharply through his nose as he leaned back against the wall with arms crossed. “Why is that?”</p><p>“Because it’s wrong. It’s morally reprehensible. You cannot just snuff out people’s lives like you’re God.”</p><p>“That’s debatable.”</p><p>“No, it isn’t!”</p><p>“Didn’t you kill a dark wizard?”</p><p>She paused. “That was different.”</p><p>He smiled and laughed, and the sight was so arresting that Hermione found herself frozen for a beat. “Was it now? So perhaps, murder isn’t always black and white.”</p><p>“Not if it’s to protect other people from dying.”</p><p>“And what if you’re that person? What if I’m protecting you?”</p><p>Hermione’s brow furrowed. “Why would you need to protect me from Minister Tuft?”</p><p>He took a deep breath and crossed to his kitchen and withdrew a bottle of Ogden’s from the cabinet. He took down two crystal glasses and began to pour shallow draughts into both of them.</p><p>He tipped one back and drained it, then refilled it. He took them both, made his way over to Hermione, and handed her a glass.</p><p>“To be honest, I’ve known I would kill that woman since the moment I met her. Call it intuition, if you like.” He took a sip of firewhiskey. “A few months ago, Tuft had me followed. Somehow she obtained a photograph of you in my flat. Apparently, she’s the one lone person in London who’s not a fan of you. I doesn't surprise me, as she’s a covert blood supremacist. In any case, she threatened to go public with our relationship if I didn’t do something about your articles.” He smiled in amusement  “Apparently, you made her look bad on more than one occasion. Not to mention in more recent developments, talk of you as a potential future ministerial candidate. She’s practically frothing at the bit to wipe you out of existence.”</p><p>He watched Hermione carefully, gauging her response, but she stood still, her features guarded, listening attentively. For once, he couldn’t discern what she was thinking. The girl who wore her emotions on her sleeve had become quite skilled in managing her expression. Hanging around politicians and influential people tends to rub off in that way. Tom gave the barest hint of a smile, the slight turning up of his lips as he realized that once again, he was impressed with Hermione. </p><p>He took another sip of whiskey as he stared at her, admiring the sight of her body in her jeweled gown and rose bedecked bodice. </p><p>“I love the way you look in my flat, Hermione.” His lips curled back, a flash of canines. “Like a diamond in a trash heap.”</p><p>Hermione blinked as she looked around herself, as if remembering something. “I thought you and Tuft were allies.”</p><p>He tilted his head. “It seems our paths have diverged.”</p><p>“Because of me?”</p><p>“Partly.” He drained his glass and set it aside. “You know she wanted to fuck me.”</p><p>That got Hermione’s attention. Her head snapped up and her eyes met his. He smirked. “Don’t worry, darling. I assured her that I already have a witch.”</p><p>The rage in Hermione’s gaze was barely concealed. </p><p>Tom’s eyes sparkled. “You want to kill her now, don’t you?” He chuckled darkly as her jaw muscles tensed, anger flaring in her dilated pupils. “Jealousy becomes you.”</p><p>She looked away and brought the glass to her lips as she took a sip. Then, she lifted her hand and slid her mask off and tossed it on his sofa. “There are other ways to deal with people besides killing them, Tom.”</p><p>“Yes, but they’re not nearly as fun for me.” She gave him a look of reproach, so he continued, “She’s outlived her use. She’s in my way, and yours. She’s a liability. She knows too much. She’s a fucking thorn in my side and I don’t like to leave loose ends.”</p><p>Hermione’s lips parted. </p><p>Tom watched, noting the way her breath grew jagged. </p><p>He crossed the room to stand before her, then laid his hand at the base of her throat, thumb pressed against her pulse. “You like it when I talk like that, don’t you? You try to act so moral and heroic, Hermione, but I think you’re darker than you let on.”</p><p>She swallowed and he tightened his grip slightly, the cords of her throat straining against his fingers. “That tends to happen when people manage to live through a war,” she whispered.</p><p>His heated gaze rested on her like a kiss, and she could almost see all of the things he wanted to do to her, reflected in his coal-dark eyes.</p><p>“You can’t kill Tuft,” she added.</p><p>“Are you ready to negotiate that?”</p><p>She laughed in disbelief. “You want something in return for not being evil?”</p><p>His gaze was intense and searching. “Is it evil to want to protect you? If so, I’ll wear it as a badge of honor.” He stroked her collarbone softly with his thumb. “How about this? Before I kill someone, I’ll consult you first. If you can’t give me a good reason not to, then I have every right to sever their head with a scythe and place it on a pike for our enemies to see.”</p><p>“I can’t believe you think I’ll discuss murder with you as if we’re a married couple deciding on new draperies.”</p><p>He chuckled. “You can choose the curtains, my dear. And speaking of marriage so soon? We’ve only just rekindled things.”</p><p>Her mouth fell open. “We have <em> not </em> rekindled things.”</p><p>He chuckled. “Whatever you say, Mrs. Riddle.”</p><p>She rolled her eyes, then took his wrist and moved his hand away from her skin.</p><p>“So you want to kill Tuft, and use me as your candidate to run the ministry for you. You think that I’ll do what you say if I win. I assure you, I will do no such thing, and I take offense to you trying to corale me like you did with my job at the Prophet.”</p><p>“That’s not what I’m doing, Hermione. I plan to run myself, and it doesn’t matter to me which of us wins. You are better suited for the job, truth be told, but I can’t risk another Tuft in office.” </p><p>“You can’t run for minister,Tom.”</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>“Because… you’d just…”</p><p>He cocked a brow. “I’d what?”</p><p>“You’d turn the whole ministry into your little death eaters club!”</p><p>He grinned. “That sounds quite perfect.”</p><p>Hermione scowled, causing Riddle’s grin to widen.</p><p>“If you don’t want me to win, then I suppose the only logical course of action would be to run against me.”</p><p>She gazed at him, her eyes dark.</p><p>He returned her gaze, his black eyes sparkling with amusement, then he cocked his head. “Speaking of which, how did Tuft leave office in the future, and who replaced her?”</p><p>She backed away, shaking her head. “You’re not going to use my knowledge of the future for your benefit. <em> This </em> is why I didn’t tell you anything!”</p><p>He took a deep breath and sighed. “I'm not trying to use it for my benefit, Hermione. It’s for <em> your </em> benefit. I’m just morbidly curious. Trust me, there are far more important things that I would ask, if we’re talking about <em> my </em> benefit.”</p><p>Hermione bit her lip. “She died. Apparently, she was allergic to alihotsy fudge and didn’t know it. Her son succeeded her.”</p><p>Tom blinked, and then his eyebrows shot up. Then, he started laughing. “So you’re telling me all I have to do is sneak the wench a tin of fudge and call it a day? Not quite as satisfying as strangling her with my bare hands, but effective nonetheless.” He wrinkled his brow, lost in thought. “Of course, it’s also a possibility that someone in the future poisoned her fudge. Might not have been an allergy after all. Shall we find out?”</p><p>“You’re insane.”</p><p>“Am I? So that wasn’t your plan when you first met me? To kill me?” He paused when the shock registered on her face. “Oh yes. I’ve figured it all out, even without you telling me. What makes you think you’re so much more righteous than I am, Hermione?”</p><p>Hermione swallowed. “Killing you would save countless lives…. And yet I’m still too weak to do it. It’s called a conscience, and most people have one.”</p><p>“I suppose you deserve a biscuit for that.”</p><p>“You kill people and yet you mock my morals.”</p><p>“I mock the discrepancies in your morals.”</p><p>She took a step forward, rage overcoming her and pulling her toward him. “Killing you would’ve saved people I cared about. It would’ve prevented genocide and mass killings. You tried to take everything from me and everyone I care about!”</p><p>Tom swallowed, his eyes roving her face. He reached out and slid his hand around the back of her neck, his thumb resting on her cheek and stroking gently. “You don’t think telling me the truth would change things? I’d do absolutely anything for you, Hermione.”</p><p>She shook her head in frustration. “I don’t want you to change for me. I want you to change because it’s right. But I know you never will. You have no sense of right and wrong… only what benefits you.”</p><p>His jaw muscles rippled in anger. “You don’t care enough about me to try. You’re so poisoned against me that you can’t see any efforts I make to right my wrongs.”</p><p>“Right your wrongs? You’re going to kill the Minister-“</p><p>“Because I hate her!” He snapped, his eyes shifting to blazing red. Hermione gasped at his sudden ferocity. “I hate anyone who speaks a word against you. I will <em> absolutely </em> kill anyone who threatens to take you from me… or anyone who stands in our way.”</p><p>Hermione’s chest heaved. “That’s frightening.”</p><p>“Well, that’s where it stands.” </p><p>His words were cold, punctuated by the ferocity of his convictions… as if he’d finally found religion, some code of morality to cling to, and that code was centered around Hermione Granger.</p><p>“I can take care of myself, Tom. I don’t need your protection.”</p><p>“I can’t help myself, Hermione.” He swallowed, his face twisted with something Hermione didn’t recognize. “I don’t think you understand. My heart beats for you. I don’t know how to be perfect for you, the way you want me to be. I’ve never been perfect. I am what I am… but whatever I am is yours. I’ll do whatever I have to do in order to be someone worthy of your love.”</p><p>Hermione’s heart fractured. “Tom,” she whispered as she reached out to run her fingertips along his cheek. “You <em> are </em> worthy of love.”</p><p>“I only want yours,” he whispered, turning his head to touch his lips to the palm of her hand.</p><p>Her lips parted. “You have it.”</p><p>His eyes were dark, jaw clenched in misery. “Then why do you deny me? All I want is you… for as long as I can possibly have you.”</p><p>Hermione’s eyes twisted with grief, tears welling up along her bottom lashes. “Oh, Tom… I wish there was a way we could be happy together.”</p><p>Tom shook his head in disbelief. “Do you not understand? Have I not made it perfectly clear to you? I would do anything to make you happy.”</p><p>“Forcing me out of a job that I loved doesn’t make me happy, Tom.”</p><p>“Let me make it right, Hermione. Perhaps I don’t have a moral compass. It’s possible that mine is broken… but you could help me. Show me what I’ve done and help me correct it. Show me how to be deserving of you.”</p><p>Hermione wanted to believe him. Desperately.</p><p>She had once thought to herself that she wanted to get to know the real Tom, the orphan boy who grew up unloved and unwanted. She realized suddenly that boy was before her now, begging for her affection.</p><p>“And if I refuse?” she murmured. “What will you do?”</p><p>His jaw visibly clenched as he grit his teeth. His black eyes snapped with ire as they flicked to hers. “I would break… but… I would let you go. As long as you can handle the fact that you’ll torment me for as long as I live.” He exhaled violently. “Which will be a very long time, little witch.”</p><p>“I kissed someone else, Tom.”</p><p>Tom’s eyes sharpened, instantly shifting to crimson.</p><p>“Who?”</p><p>“Gaspard.”</p><p>His eyebrows shot up. “Your <em> boss </em>?”</p><p>She nodded. “We almost had sex.”</p><p>Tom froze, his red eyes penetrating Hermione as if he could turn her inside out. The expression on his face wasn’t one of anger… It was one of betrayal. “And why didn’t you?”</p><p>Hermione averted her eyes, gazing at the wood grain in his floor. Her lips parted as she sucked in a labored breath. “How could I? It’s only ever been you.”</p><p>Tom examined her face, searching her features for explanation. </p><p>She turned her gaze back to him at length. </p><p>“When was this?”</p><p>“Two weeks ago.”</p><p>He appeared to be absorbing the information. </p><p>He blinked, his eyes skirting her as he walked across the room and stood before the windows, gazing out at the dark alley of Knockturn, lit dimly by dirty street lamps. His expression was like ice. He took his pack of cigarettes out and drew one, lifting it to his lips and lighting it wandlessly.</p><p>“Tom…”</p><p>He swallowed, his Adam’s apple bobbing. “I'm just imagining you with him.”</p><p>“Don’t. Don’t do that.”</p><p>His cheek muscles flexed. “Did I drive you to it, Hermione?”</p><p>Hermione sighed. “I suppose everything you’ve ever done drove me to it. But I don’t deny that it was a mistake. I was drunk.”</p><p>“You got drunk with him? Was that the night you were at The Three Broomsticks?”</p><p>She nodded silently. </p><p>He cocked his jaw to the side, gazing out at the crooked street below.</p><p>“You were with Walburga for six years, Tom-“</p><p>“That was before I bloody met you.”</p><p>“It was one kiss. Well, two.”</p><p>“Fucking hell,” Tom muttered angrily.</p><p>“We were not together, Tom… <em> are </em> not.”</p><p>His nostrils flared and he spun around, eyes blazing crimson. “Mine, you said. Forever.”</p><p>“Do you think that’s not true now?”</p><p>He blinked, then swallowed once more. He took a drag, expelling smoke from between his lips. “I suppose it’s my fault. I thought giving you space was the best thing. But apparently you’re a sadist and enjoy torturing me when left to your own devices-“</p><p>“That’s not fair.”</p><p>He chuckled, then murmured, “And here I am, wanting…” He trailed off, his eyes fixed on the shrunken head shop across the street.</p><p>“Wanting what, Tom?”</p><p>“Wanting you to be my wife.”</p><p>Hermione’s breath left her lungs.</p><p>She took three deep breaths, her vision blurring.</p><p>The wife of Lord Voldemort.</p><p>Part of her recognized the ludicrousness of it, but another part of her felt a secret thrill run through her body.</p><p>Voldemort wanted to marry her.</p><p>How could she even have a stable relationship with him? How was it possible?</p><p>He didn’t even know the truth yet.</p><p>Which, she supposed, was her fault.</p><p>
<em> His wife. </em>
</p><p>Everything in Hermione screamed <em> yes </em>.</p><p>But her mind questioned the sanity of it all.</p><p>“Tom…” </p><p>He didn’t look at her.</p><p>She made her way over to him, and stood beside him, gazing up to search his face. She reached up to run her knuckles along his sharp cheekbones, then brushed her fingertips through his closely clipped, ink-colored hair.</p><p>“I hoped for someone to make me stop missing you.” She sighed, then took his hand, and plucked the cigarette from his fingers.</p><p>She lifted it to her lips and sucked in a drag of her own. As she blew out smoke, she breathed, “It didn’t work.”</p><p>He stood with eyes lowered for a moment, then turned and slid his hands around her waist, his long fingers forming a girdle as he pulled her against him. </p><p>“I’ve done nothing but love you, Hermione. Even if it wasn’t the proper way… You were and are still my foremost priority.” He took the cigarette from her and sucked in another drag. He turned his head to the side and exhaled. “I suppose in the beginning it was a game… a distracting, delicious game. But I think you very quickly became the only person I’ve ever cared about. I cannot go back to who I was before I met you.” He touched her hair, brushing back a curl from her face. “My life feels so empty without you.”</p><p>Hermione slid her hands up his velvet jacket, then snaked her arms around his neck, her fingers threading into the fine hair at the base of his neck. “Despite everything I know… I love you, Tom Marvolo Riddle. That is something I cannot deny.”</p><p>Their eyes locked into a searing soul connection, something too potent and powerful for words. Tom’s magic rose around him, like crackling electricity. It melded with the currents of her fluid, wave-like magic, his darkness licking at the edges of her light. </p><p>“Say it,” he breathed.</p><p>Her eyes fell closed. “I’m yours,” she whispered.</p><p>Tom’s mouth covered hers in a bruising kiss, his tongue sliding against hers hungrily.  He brushed his fingers against the vine-like straps of her gown and pushed the bodice away, revealing her naked breasts. He handled them, cupping them in his hands and running his thumbs over her nipples. Hermione gave a little sound against his lips as the peaks hardened beneath his touch.</p><p>He kissed her until she was gasping for air, and then he broke away to murmur, “How could you leave me?”</p><p>Their eyes met and she whispered, “You deserved it.”</p><p>He kissed her again, his teeth tugging on her bottom lip before he responded, “You’re right, I did.”</p><p>Then, their lips crashed together again, and she caught his tongue in her mouth and sucked on it, causing his eyes to roll back in his head. “Fuck yes,” he muttered, his voice hoarse with hunger. “Let me have you, Hermione.”</p><p>Hermione’s mouth fell open and she could feel his hot breath against her lips and in her mouth. She didn’t understand the hold he had upon her. </p><p>Everything within her was yielding… so hungry for his touch, for his words, for his mouth. Was it some kind of spell? Was he using his magic to pull her in?</p><p>He pulled up the skirt of her gown and slipped his hand into her knickers. She felt the roughness of his fingers sliding along her slick entrance. </p><p>“Fuck, I’ve missed this,” he breathed. His expression was raw and pained. “I’ve missed your sweet cunt… and your soft tits… and your pretty moans… and your fucking hair. <em> Goddammit </em> Hermione.” His jaw muscles flexed and one would almost think his expression was one of pure hatred. But in reality, it was of desperate desire.</p><p>He slid his fingers inside her. “I need you… I need you, now.”</p><p>Her heart pounded in reaction to the visceral need she felt. It was like a drug sweeping through her body. </p><p>She fought the desire, but her resistance was crumbling beneath his desperate pleas.</p><p>“Are you happy, little witch? Now I’m the one begging at your feet.” He swallowed, anguish twisting his handsome face. He pumped his fingers in and out of her. “You’re so wet. Even though you hate me… your body betrays how much you want me.”</p><p>“I don’t hate you, Tom.” She was already pulling his black dress shirt out of his trousers and working on the buttons.</p><p>He lifted his fingers to his lips and slowly sucked her taste from them, his eyes locked with hers. </p><p>Hermione’s breathing was strained with anticipation. He leaned in and whispered in her ear, “I’m going to fuck you, so you’d better say no now, because I won’t be able to stop once I start.”</p><p>He allowed her to rip his jacket off, pulling it down his shoulders and arms, then she finished with his buttons and did the same with his shirt.</p><p>The moment his shirt hit the ground, he drew the blinds and then turned her around. He bent over and kissed her bare shoulder as he undid the buttons of her bodice, reveling in the slight trembling of her body. When he finished, he pushed the gown down over her waist and it fell to her feet. She was completely bare to his gaze, save for a pair of black lace knickers. Tom cocked an eyebrow as he hooked his fingers into the thin waistband of the underthings, then dragged it along the curve of her bum.</p><p>“What kind of contraption is this? I don’t think I’ve seen anything like this, muggle or otherwise.”</p><p>Hermione turned her head to the side, fighting back laughter. “Tom, it’s called a thong… and no, they’re not very popular in this time.”</p><p>“Because they’re <em> obscene… </em> although I find them rather perfect.” He slid his hand over the curve of her hip. “Has anyone ever told you that you have a magnificent arse?”</p><p>He slipped an arm around her stomach and pulled her back against him, letting her feel the hardness of his cock against her backside.</p><p>“No,” she breathed. “Although no one has seen it but you.”</p><p>“Let’s keep it that way.”</p><p>He reached up and fondled her breast as his lips met her shoulder again, then he pressed his face into her hair, breathing in her scent.</p><p>She stepped out of her gown, and the moment she was free, he pulled her against him and gripped her thighs, hoisting her legs around his waist. He shoved her back against the wall beside the doorway and kissed her, forcing her mouth to open, tugging on her lip with his teeth, devouring her like a criminal would his last meal.</p><p>“Tom,” she whimpered as she broke away. “<em> Please </em>.”</p><p>“Please what,” he said impatiently. “Use your words, little witch.”</p><p>“Please fuck me until I can’t stand.”</p><p>His eyebrows rose sharply and he reached between them, keeping her pinned to the wall as he unbuckled his belt and unzipped his trousers. </p><p>She brushed his hands aside and removed him from his trousers herself. She slid her fingertips along his shaft, tapping her long nails against his velvety smooth skin.</p><p>“Fuck,” he whispered, his cock twitching reflexively at her touch.</p><p>She smiled at him, then lined him up against her entrance but no further. With an impish grin, she rolled her hips against him, teasing him with the barest hint of her warmth.</p><p>“You evil little witch,” he murmured. “They’d have burned you at the stake for witchcraft in another century.”</p><p>There was something intensely erotic about the way he looked at her, his red eyes having faded back to black. </p><p>He pressed himself against her entrance, and Hermione began to tremble. The heat of his cock against her was something she’d missed desperately. It felt too good. Too right. He teased her slit open.</p><p>Hermione’s eyes sparked with lust. “I love you, you psychotic asshole.”</p><p>Tom smirked and chuckled in his deep tenor, his eyes falling to her mouth. He slid himself along her wet entrance again before plunging inside her warmth.</p><p>“Fuck, I missed this,” he breathed against her hair. “You’re mine, Hermione. Don’t leave me again.”</p><p>The moment he slid inside her, she let out a desperate moan. It wasn’t lust. It was as if the moment he entered her, he also penetrated her soul. </p><p>“Let me make you come, Hermione. Let me bring you to ecstasy.” He began to thrust in fevered passion. “Say it. Tell me you’re mine.”</p><p>Instead of obeying his command, she whispered, “You’re mine.”</p><p>He paused, eyes locked on her face, still as a statue. He searched her eyes, and their magic crackled, swirling around them in a whirling dervish of intangible atoms.</p><p>Hermione longed to pull him closer, to become incorporeal so that her essence could melt into his, blending into one being, one existence. She rolled her hips against his, seeking more of him inside her. She wrapped her arms tighter around his neck, drawing herself up against him, her breasts pressed tightly against the muscular planes of his chest.</p><p>His lips parted, and he whispered against her hair as he began to thrust again, “I’m yours. All yours, Hermione.”</p><p>He thrust harder, fucking her through her moans. Then he lifted her higher and wrapped her thighs around his waist, spreading them wider, seating himself deeply inside her. </p><p>“Oh <em> fuck </em>,” she breathed as he began to stroke a spot deep inside her, and it took her breath away. Her abs tightened with the tension building in her core.</p><p>“No one will ever fuck you the way I do, little witch. This is ours. We can have it all. We can create our own world, just ours.”</p><p>Hermione’s mouth fell open as her legs began to quiver around his waist. Her voice was shrill and high-pitched as she rasped, “Oh my god- Tom- <em> fuck </em>.”</p><p>Tom’s pupils flared and he grinned as he watched her face twist into one of torturous bliss, rising into the heights of unmatched pleasure. Her walls tightened around him, and he sped up, drilling her into the wall as she let out a cry followed by a series of animalistic moans. </p><p>“Tell me how it feels, Hermione.”</p><p>She was out of breath, but managed to whisper, “So <em> good… </em>”</p><p>He leaned down and kissed her hungrily, still chasing the heights of his own passion as he railed her against the wall.</p><p>“I want you every way possible,” he growled, his voice hoarse and dark. “I want you everywhere. I’ve been losing my mind remembering the way you feel. Seeing you in the papers with him… it’s taken all of my willpower not to end him. You should really be more careful.”</p><p>Hermione could hardly process the words he was saying as she was teetering on the edge of release. “Don’t-“ she rasped between his thrusts. “Don’t touch him, Tom.” Then she moaned, unable to speak, unable to <em> think </em>. “Harder.”</p><p>“Ask nicely.”</p><p>“Harder, <em> please </em>.”</p><p>Tom smirked. He slowed his speed but increased his power, thrusting into her hard and deep. She leaned her forehead against his, their breaths mingling, her moans coming rhythmically as Tom felt himself hardening. He reached between them and rubbed her clit, but she moved his hand away, shaking her head. “No, I don’t need that. Just keep doing what you’re doing, that spot, just like that.”</p><p>Tom grinned, flashing his white teeth as his black eyes met hers. “I could make you come every day, baby. I’ll give you every fucking thing you could ever want.”</p><p>She bit her lip, but murmured, “Sex isn’t everything, Tom.”</p><p>“What do you want, darling?” He leaned down to whisper in her ear, and his deep voice sent shivers through her body. “Name it and it’s yours. I’ll give you my soul if you ask for it. I already have, but you gave it back.”</p><p>She let out a desperate cry, so close to finishing, his impassioned words driving her further into an uninhibited state. “Tell me more, Tom.”</p><p>He brushed a few unruly curls from her face and then gripped her throat. “I’ll make your life paradise, Hermione. I can make you happy, you just need to tell me the truth.”</p><p>“Do you love me?” Her walls tightened around him, and Tom felt himself growing painfully hard, his balls tightening and drawing up close to his body, but he held a tight rein on himself.</p><p>“So much so that I would burn the world for you.” He adjusted her so that he was driving upward, intent on rearranging her organs.</p><p>“Oh, fuck,Tom… you’re so deep.” </p><p>He knew she was there when her head fell back and her eyes fell closed. Her warmth began to pulse violently around him, and he felt his vision blackening with tiny stars, the sheer pleasure of it nearly knocking him off his feet. </p><p>He watched her chest flush red, felt her fingers tightening in his hair, pulling painfully, but he loved it. “Yes, baby, that’s it. Such a good girl.” He stroked her cheek as he thrust hard and deep, driving her over the edge. “Beautiful,” he muttered, in awe. “Bloody perfect.”</p><p>She released a strangled cry, and in that very moment, he began to throb, fully sheathed inside her as they both pulsed simultaneously, coming as one. He lowered his head, resting it on her shoulder as he shot into her, his breathing stalled for those few moments. He felt her clenching around him as his warm cum filled her, as if she were begging for it.</p><p>“Holy shit,” he muttered, finally releasing his breath, chest heaving. “You are… wow.”</p><p>“Hmm?” she hummed happily, barely conscious. “I’m what?”</p><p>He swallowed hard. “I may have fucked my fair share of witches but the sex was never this good. Not even close.”</p><p>She laughed, a trenchant bit of air escaping through her nose. “It’s just because you love me, darling.”</p><p>He cocked his head. “You’ve never called me that.”</p><p>“First time for everything.”</p><p>His lips pulled up into a side smile. “I much prefer Lord. Sir. <em> Master </em>.”</p><p>“Do you take me for a death eater?”</p><p>He grinned, then ran his fingers softly along the place on her arm where her scar lay, concealed. “I’d like to mark you up like one.”</p><p>He pulled out, then withdrew his wand from his pocket and cast a contraception charm. Then, he gently sat her on her feet. She winced slightly.</p><p>“Did I hurt you?”</p><p>“No, it’s just been a minute, and you’re…” she trailed off, her cheeks flushing pink.</p><p>He blinked several times. “I’m what?”</p><p>Her eyes flicked to his and then averted. “Well, you’re kind of… big.”</p><p>He cocked his head, eyes narrowing. Then, his lips twitched and he lifted his hand to cover his mouth. “Is that so?”</p><p>“Oh, nevermind,” she huffed, shoving him aside with a roll of her eyes. “You wizards and your egos.”</p><p>“I didn’t say a word.”</p><p>Hermione started to step back into her gown, causing Tom to grip her arm and spin her around. </p><p>“What do you think you’re doing?”</p><p>“I- well… I thought-“</p><p>“You’re not leaving tonight.”</p><p>Hermione heaved a deep breath and looked at him, exasperated. “Tom…”</p><p>He shook his head. “I don’t know what in Merlin’s name you’re thinking, but the last time <em> I </em> fucked <em> you </em> and left, you gave me quite a tongue lashing.”</p><p>She sighed. </p><p>“Unless, of course, you don’t want to stay.”</p><p>Hermione bit her lip. This night had gone further than she’d ever intended. Was she ready to fall back into their old habits?</p><p>Somehow, it didn’t feel the same. This time, it felt different. </p><p>It felt as if there were some level of trust beginning to form.</p><p>Her eyes trailed over his muscular shoulders and the smooth marble-like contours of his chest which was etched with the strange runes from the Feast of Bones ritual, then her eyes followed the light line of hair that disappeared beneath the waistline of his trousers. </p><p>“I always want to stay,” she whispered.</p><p>He reached for her hand and pulled her closer, and she shivered as the warmth of his body enveloped her, warding off the chill. “Then stay,” he whispered against her hair.</p><p>She melted into his embrace, knowing she would never again have the strength to leave.</p>

<h2 class="heading">Rainy Sunday</h2>
</div>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Hermione woke with a start to darkness, and the loud clap of thunder. Lightning streaked the sky, illuminating the bedroom through the shaded windows. A moment later, another peal of thunder rumbled into the distance. Suddenly, rain began to pelt the roof, a roaring torrent blanketing the serene darkness. </p><p>Arms were wrapped around her waist, and the hardness of a man’s chest and stomach were hot against her back, enveloping her in a cocoon of warmth. For someone she’d always imagined to be so cold, Tom Riddle’s body was incredibly warm, like a blazing furnace of skin. </p><p>She turned in his arms to face him, and even in his deep sleep, he tightened his arms reflexively as if to keep her near him. Lightning struck, flashing momentarily over his face and she noted the dark circles under his eyes. Hermione ran her fingertips along his cheek, deciding that he looked quite exhausted. Drained. Had he missed her that badly? Was he stressed for some reason? It was odd for him to sleep so deeply, when he had always seemed to wake before her, or at least stir to consciousness whenever she made even the slightest move in her sleep. It was as if he couldn’t bear to be vulnerable, too paranoid to allow himself to rest in the presence of another. Perhaps the orphanage had made him that way.</p><p>Only now, he slept soundly. </p><p>She extricated herself from his arms carefully, which was quite a task, and bent over the edge of the mattress, reaching for the night table where his pocketwatch sat. </p><p>She clicked it open. 6:13 am.</p><p>It was quite dark still, made even darker by the black storm clouds overhead.</p><p>Hermione was used to waking early. Even this was a little late for her to sleep, but the night had waxed late by the time she’d collapsed, tangled in Tom’s limbs.</p><p>She always had plans. Responsibilities. Too many things on her plate. Thankfully, she had Piksy to keep her on task. </p><p>Despite her busy agenda, she found that this morning, she had nothing planned. She would have to see Dumbledore in the afternoon, but her busy week essentially started early Monday morning. She would have to help in whatever way she could with the investigation. Despite the romantic night she’d had, she hadn’t forgotten all of London was still in an uproar. The breaches were all anyone could talk about at the ball. She had another quarterly convening of the International Confederation of Wizards approaching soon, and the breaches would surely be the central topic of discussion. </p><p>When she turned back to Tom, she found him awake. He gazed at her in the meager light, rain pounding the rooftop, his eyes roaming her face as if he was shocked to wake and find her in his bed.</p><p>“Good morning,” she whispered with a small smile.</p><p>He didn’t smile back, but his hand reached out and wandered her hip, following its curve down to her thigh. “It is a good morning,” he muttered, his voice hoarse with sleep.</p><p>“<em> Very </em> good,” she smiled, unable to control her giddy expression.</p><p>He cocked an eyebrow. “I find it amusing how drastically your mood improves with a good fuck. Food and sex… you’re as bad as a man, Hermione.”</p><p>She rolled her eyes. “I could’ve had casual sex anytime if I wanted it, Tom.”</p><p>His eyes narrowed. “Don’t remind me.”</p><p>She searched his face. “Am I forgiven?”</p><p>His brows quirked, and he shook his head. “There’s nothing to forgive. You don’t owe me anything. It’s like you said… I deserved it.”</p><p>“But will it continue to bother you?”</p><p>His eyes met hers, and he was quiet for a beat. “I’ll get over it, Hermione.” He cleared his throat. “I don’t like the thought of you working with him, though, but there’s not much I can do about that, is there?”</p><p>Hermione bit her lip. “Are you quite serious about killing Minister Tuft?”</p><p>He blinked, flicking his eyes at her, before looking away. “Yes.”</p><p>She swallowed, then inhaled deeply. “I wish you wouldn’t.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“Because…” she trailed off, looking around the room. “It’s dangerous, and I don’t want you caught.”</p><p>He snorted, laughter rumbling in his chest. “I appreciate your concern, darling, but I’m afraid my track record is rather perfect.”</p><p>“Did you have something to do with the breaches, Tom?”</p><p>His eyes sharpened. He ran his tongue over his top teeth. “You expect me to tell you the truth when you work for the DMLE?”</p><p>Hermione’s eyes scanned his face, then she sighed. “I’ll take that as a yes. I don’t suppose you’ll tell me <em> why </em> you thought it was a good idea?”</p><p>“Divulge your secrets, and I’ll divulge mine.”</p><p>She swallowed and looked away.</p><p>He watched her for a moment. “When will you tell me?”</p><p>Her eyes lifted to meet his. “I mean… is this… are we…”</p><p>His eyes narrowed slightly. “Are we what?”</p><p>Her lips parted. “Are we doing this, for real? Are we serious about this?” She swallowed again. “<em> Us </em>, I mean.”</p><p>He chewed the inside of his cheek, eyes still narrowed. “I’m very serious, Hermione. I think I’ve been quite clear about that.”</p><p>She nodded, looking down at his chest, where her fingers traced the runes crudely burned into his chest. </p><p>After a few moments, she sighed. “Soon, Tom.”</p><p>She felt the weight of his gaze upon her, but she refused to meet his stare. She still had so many questions and uncertainties. In truth, she hadn’t anticipated or planned for this reunion, but now that it had happened, she realized that she’d been wanting it all along, deep down.</p><p>She’d been wishing to see him again, to kiss him, to hear him tell her how he felt.</p><p>But she still wasn’t positive that their relationship wouldn’t end in heartbreak or violence. She wasn’t sure if he was good for her… but did it really matter? When she wanted him so conclusively? It was as if she’d been forced down a path that ended at the shore of a tumultuous, dangerous ocean. There was no way out but through, it seemed.</p><p>“Soon.”</p><p>“When?”</p><p>She took a deep breath. “A week. Two at the most.”</p><p>“I’m holding you to it.”</p><p>As she looked up at him, in her heart, she prayed, <em> Please, don’t break me </em>.</p><p>The moment she thought it, their eyes met, and somehow she knew that he was thinking the exact same thing.</p><p><em> Don’t break me, Hermione </em> . <em> I’ll never recover </em>. </p><p>Was it legilimency? Had he somehow penetrated her mind? Or had he let her into his?</p><p>Before she could ask, he reached out and gripped the back of her neck, pulling her in for a kiss.</p><p>Thunder cracked violently, and jagged lightning illuminated the sky much like the scar on Harry’s forehead. </p><p>As their lips locked in a searing kiss, Hermione wondered if the future would stay the same.</p><p>She would, in all likelihood, never know.</p><p>She could only hope that the love she and Tom were cultivating would be enough to heal the open wound Voldemort had left in the future.</p><p>Rain beat down on the roof insistently. Water dripped from the ceiling in the corner of the room.</p><p>Tom kissed her and she returned it with fervency. His fingers traced her jaw, then followed the line of her neck as if he were memorizing her edges and contours. When his mouth left hers to suck roughly on her neck, she gasped, begging him for more, asking for marks, for bruises. </p><p>He gave in to her pleas, leaving purple marks on her throat and breasts. When he gripped her thighs and spread them apart, his fingers bit into her flesh, leaving the beginnings of bruises like accessories on her thighs. </p><p>She felt his lips touching softly to each mark, then a moment later, his hot breath fell against the slickness between her thighs, his disheveled hair tickling her skin. </p><p>His tongue slid along her entrance, slipping inside her quickly and then out again to swirl around her clit. His lips met the bundle of nerves and sucked gently, causing her hips to twitch, to lift upward and seek more. Her fingers slid into his hair, pressing his head against her.</p><p>His chest rumbled, a deep sound that vibrated against her, eliciting a moan from her throat. </p><p>“Tom,” she whispered.</p><p>His teeth grazed her flesh, and he sucked harder, then his tongue penetrated her, pulsing inside of her as she threw her head back with a high-pitched moan. His hand snaked upward along her stomach and chest to wrap his fingers around her throat, tightening until her breathing grew shallow and labored.</p><p>She looked down and watched as he turned his head, her wetness stringing from his lips as he sunk his teeth into her thigh sharply. </p><p>She cried out, then bit her lip as his bite mark began to form. </p><p>He leaned back and took his wand from the side table. He muttered a quick, “incarcerous” and thin ropes shot out of his wand, binding up her wrists and lashing them to his headboard. </p><p>He grinned at her apprehensive expression, flashing his canines as he spun his wand deftly around his fingers. </p><p>“Open your mouth.”</p><p>Her eyes widened and rose to meet his. She swallowed as his eyes flashed crimson, then back to black. He cocked his head.</p><p>“Hermione,” he said sternly. </p><p>Her mouth fell open. He leaned in and slid the carved end of his yew wand into her mouth. His eyes never left hers. </p><p>“Close,” he commanded. </p><p>She closed her lips around its wood, and it reminded her of being at the dentist, her tongue curling around the birdlike carving on its handle. That carving had always reminded her of death.</p><p>“Do not open your mouth.”</p><p>He sat back on his knees, finally free from the sheets he was under, and she saw that he was totally naked. His cock was hard and swollen, jutting out from his body like a sword. Her eyes followed the line of hair trailing up his stomach to the hard contours of his chest muscles and defined shoulders. </p><p>She would’ve bit her lip at the sight, were his wand not filling her mouth.</p><p>“Such a good little witch,” he praised. His eyes dragged over her body, admiring the treasure map of bruises and marks scattered across her skin. </p><p>“I’ve had several months to think of everything I want to do to you,” he said with a grin. “Of course, it will take years to do it all, but I think we have time. Don’t you?” His grin widened as she nodded. “Some of it will take getting used to, but don’t worry, love… I’ll ease you into it.”</p><p>Her eyes widened and her heart rate sped up. </p><p>He gripped her hips and turned her onto her side. She began to breathe heavily, her wrists tied above her head and her mouth effectively gagged. She let out a whimper as he slid behind her. </p><p>He pulled her hair behind her shoulder, letting it fall down her back. Then he pressed his face into its soft tresses, breathing in her flowery scent. </p><p>“Fuck, I love the smell of you, witch,” he murmured. </p><p>He hooked his hand around her knee and lifted her thigh. With his other hand, he lined himself up against her opening, pushing his tip into her heat. </p><p>A moan escaped her throat, muffled around his wand. </p><p>He whispered into her ear, “You asked me to fuck you until you couldn’t walk, but unfortunately you were still able to do so last night, so I plan to remedy that this morning.” He kissed her cheek as he slid deeper, and she threw her head back over his shoulder. “I want your boss to wonder why you’re wincing when you sit down.” He gripped her hair, arching her neck as he pulled her head back. “If he asks you why, you’re going to tell him that Tom Riddle fucked you senseless.”</p><p>He smiled as she made a frustrated sound. He lowered his head to her throat, swiping his tongue over the purple marks. “You’re not allowed to cover these. Then maybe I’ll forgive you for letting another wizard touch you.”</p><p>She let out another whimper as he sheathed himself fully within her, lifting her leg higher so that her walls tightened around him. Then he shifted, angling himself so that she felt him in her stomach. </p><p>She moaned, and it sounded like a sob. He quieted her with a soft “shh” against her hair. “Such a good girl for me. Loves to be marked. Loves to be used. Loves to give up control. Absolutely perfect.” </p><p>In that moment, he thrust hard and deep. Hermione couldn’t help the strangled sound that left her chest. Then he thrust again, deeper. Her eyes rolled back. He picked up speed, and her core began to tighten. Pain and pleasure rocketed through her middle, causing her thighs to tremble.</p><p>With his free hand, he brushed his middle finger between her arse cheeks. She jerked and made a sound of protest, but he held her steady with his hand firmly around her knee. He laughed lightly, then muttered against the shell of her ear, “Oh, every part of you is going to belong to me, little witch. In good time. There won’t be an inch of you that I haven’t claimed.”</p><p>She moaned as her walls constricted, clenching around him as she began to arch against him, seeking more, even though she was painfully full of him. He moved his free hand from her bum to her throat and wrapped his fingers around her neck as he drove into her. </p><p>“How many times did you touch yourself and think of me, little witch? How many tears did you cry? I need to know, because I’m going to make you shed that many tears with my cock down your throat.”</p><p>She couldn’t answer with his wand in her mouth, but that only made him chuckle. “You don’t need to answer, little witch. I watched you come with my name on your lips many times the past few months.”</p><p>She started, an angry sound leaving her throat as she attempted to spit his wand from her mouth, but he tightened his grip painfully on her throat. </p><p>“I said, don’t <em> fucking open your mouth </em>.”</p><p>She stilled, but a choked sob left her throat. He kissed her cheek. “Don’t touch yourself without my permission again.”</p><p>She let out a frustrated sound, but he thrust roughly, silencing her protest. Her head fell back against his shoulder and their eyes met. </p><p>His hand left her throat and gripped the tip of his wand. “Open.”</p><p>Her lips parted and he withdrew the wand from her mouth. His movements became quick and brutal, and he leaned forward to kiss her, thrusting his tongue into her mouth with the same sense of urgency.</p><p>The ropes holding her wrists bit into her skin as she used them as leverage to arch against him. </p><p>“Harder,” she begged, and he answered with punishing force.</p><p>He tightened his grip on her throat, and she gasped, “I’m going to-“</p><p>“Beg,” he said sharply, his tone brooking no refusal.</p><p>“Please, Tom. I can’t stop it.”</p><p>“You will if I tell you to, won’t you?”</p><p>“Yes,” she rasped, struggling. </p><p>He felt her walls tightening around him. The feeling was maddening.</p><p>“Yes, <em> sir </em>, little witch.”</p><p>“Yes, sir,” she moaned breathlessly, part of her rebelling against his tone of command, and another part of her craving it, <em> needing </em> it like she needed air to breathe.</p><p>“Come for me. Now, Hermione.” His hand flexed around her neck like a collar, cutting off her breath and circulation all at once. </p><p>She let go, his words the only encouragement needed. White burst on her vision, her ab muscles contracting as she throbbed around his length, which was growing impossibly hard with each thrust, and she was vaguely aware through the euphoria that he issued his own groan, chasing his release as he filled her with his spend. </p><p>The friction of those last movements were a pleasure Hermione could have only dreamt about. He drove himself deep through waves of pulsating heat and ecstasy. Soft moans fell from her lips, as her thighs shook violently.</p><p>“Tom,” she choked out.</p><p>“I love you,” he whispered, almost seeming reluctant to pull away. When he did, he lowered her leg gently and picked up his wand, releasing her wrists from the binds. He cast a cleaning charm, and a contraceptive as well. Then he stroked her bare thighs and asked how she felt. </p><p>“Fine,” she said, shaking slightly and shivering.</p><p>He pulled her close and wrapped a blanket around them both. Then he lifted her wrists to examine them. “I have a salve for these.”</p><p>She nodded, but said nothing.</p><p>His brows furrowed, worry tinting his features. “Are you alright?”</p><p>“Kiss me,” was all she said.</p><p>So he did. The rain continued to beat down upon the rooftop, but it was gentler now.</p><p>After they laid in silence, listening to the downpour for several minutes, he spoke.</p><p>“I don’t want to leave you,” he said with a sigh. “But I have to go and find out who took those pictures.”</p><p>“And what if you can’t?”</p><p>He was quiet for a moment. “Then we will do whatever you want. I know it’s not ideal at this point in your career.”</p><p>She sighed, running her fingers over the prominent veins in his forearms. “I mean… I suppose people were bound to find out at some point… and… if we are going to be…” She swallowed. “… <em> serious </em>.”</p><p>He didn’t say anything, but lay with his arms around her, letting her think and speak.</p><p>“I mean… is it what you want, Tom?”</p><p>He ran his tongue over his top teeth, deep in thought.</p><p>She added, “I mean, I know that we have very opposite views…”</p><p>He rolled away from her and reached onto the floor, pulling his pack of cigarettes from his trouser pocket. </p><p>He sat up in bed and leaned back against the headboard, lighting one. “I don’t think our views are quite that opposite of late.”</p><p>Hermione didn’t know what he meant. </p><p>He blew out smoke. “I suppose I could come out and say I kissed you. They don’t have to know you reciprocated.”</p><p>Hermione shook her head. “No. There’s no use in lying, especially if we intend to… see more of each other.”</p><p>He blinked, staring straight ahead.</p><p>“And,” she continued, “I wouldn’t do that to you. I’m not ashamed of you. That’s never been the issue.”</p><p>He swallowed hard, still staring straight ahead. Hermione’s eyes narrowed, and she realized suddenly that he’d been waiting for her to say those words to him for months.</p><p>He’d secretly feared that she didn’t consider him worthy.</p><p>“I love you, Tom,” she said softly. “I don’t know what we’ll do about our differences… but I’m sure we will figure it out.”</p><p>His jaw flexed and he stood, stuck the cigarette between his lips and then extended his hand to Hermione, muttering around the cigarette, “Tea, Mrs. Riddle?”</p><p>She rolled her eyes but still smiled and took his hand and let him help her out of bed.</p><p>He tossed her a white shirt from his closet and that’s when she saw them. </p><p>Her nightgowns, laying across his chair.</p><p>The chair where he always laid out his clothes every night.</p><p>She cleared her throat. “I’m surprised as obsessive compulsive as you are, that you didn’t move those,” she said, pointing to the chair.</p><p>He followed her gaze, then smirked. “Those, I’m afraid, have become a part of the structural integrity of this flat. If they get moved, I’m afraid the place will combust.”</p><p>She noticed he kicked something under his bed, but she shook her head, confused, and continued to button up his shirt. </p><p> </p><hr/><p><br/>
Tom sat in his armchair, staring at Hermione as she roamed his flat with a cup of tea in hand.</p><p>Tom always took the mornings to think and strategize.</p><p>Hermione, on the other hand, couldn’t sit still in the morning. She either had to have her nose in an abnormally large book, or she would constantly be roaming about, organizing papers, planning for her work, scanning blueprints, cleaning the kitchen, answering mail, or any other such menial task. </p><p>Tom, however, didn’t mind. He greatly enjoyed sitting back with a coffee in one hand and a cigarette in the other, his eyes possessively tracing the slender curve of her calves and delicate feet as she loped about.</p><p>He watched her examine his cupboards, rifle through the scrolls on his table, curious about his most recent study material, and peek through the blinds to watch the passersby as they skulked along the cobbled streets of Knockturn Alley.</p><p>“Should’ve cast a rain repelling charm,” she tutted, watching a rather round dark wizard in a black cape barrel through the rain, soaking wet.</p><p>A moment later, she gasped.</p><p>“I think I just saw a werewolf,” she said as if it were the most interesting bit of gossip. </p><p>Tom’s lips twitched. “How do you know?”</p><p>“He’s got fresh cuts all over his face… and it was just a full moon. Oh!” she exclaimed. “He’s going into the <em> giant’s </em> alley.”</p><p>“As many do.”</p><p>“I thought it was a secret.”</p><p>“For most, it is.”</p><p>“Tom,” she said with an eyebrow lifted.</p><p>“Hermione.”</p><p>One would’ve thought his conversation a bit dry, if they hadn’t seen the way his eyes positively glittered as he watched her.</p><p>“Did you ever… did you do things with Walburga that you haven’t done with me?”</p><p>He lifted his cigarette to his lips, eyes narrowed. He languidly took a deep drag and then released the smoke before answering, “Why do I feel like this is a dangerous question?”</p><p>Hermione bit her lip. “It isn’t. I just wondered if… well, maybe if you were holding back. With me, I mean.”</p><p>“You mean… sexually?”</p><p>She looked away, then nodded.</p><p>Tom tilted his head, his expression pensive. “I suppose.”</p><p>“Oh.” She sounded disappointed. “Why?”</p><p>He cocked his jaw to the side, blinking. “I’d rather not talk about this, but if you insist…”</p><p>She gave him the most devastated look, and he sighed, having no other alternative. “It took more to get me off. With her. That’s all.”</p><p>She took a sip of her tea and then sat it down, walking slowly across the room to where he sat in his armchair, his elbows on the arm of the chair and legs spread wide like a king.</p><p>His eyes were dark as they followed her.</p><p>“What things?”</p><p>He glared at her, his jaw muscles tensed. “Bad things.”</p><p>“Would you ever do them with me?”</p><p>His nostrils flared, and he answered with punctuated slowness as he put out his cigarette, “I don’t want to do those things to you.”</p><p>“But you did them to her.”</p><p>He reached out and snatched her wrist, pulling her into his lap. “That’s because I didn’t give a fuck if she stayed or went.”</p><p>Hermione felt breathless. She swallowed, then murmured, “I like what you did this morning.”</p><p>His lips twitched. “Did you?”</p><p>“Mhmm.”</p><p>His eyes fell to her lips.</p><p>“You want me to hurt you?”</p><p>Her lips parted. “I don’t know. Not until I try something.”</p><p>“I’ve hurt you before.”</p><p>“You mean… the first time. You crucio’d me.”</p><p>He nodded. “And I never will again.”</p><p>“What else did you do?”</p><p>His eyes narrowed. “Things better left in the past.”</p><p>She blinked, then looked away, disappointed.</p><p>He reached up and took her chin between his thumb and forefinger, turning her back to face him. “You are not her.”</p><p>“I know that,” she whispered. “But… if those were things you enjoyed...”</p><p>“I enjoyed them because I wasn’t fond of her. I enjoy different things now because I am fond of you.”</p><p>When her eyelashes fluttered, his heart stopped, and Tom thought to himself that she was full of witchcraft. “You said you’ve thought of things that you want to do to me.”</p><p>He nodded. “And I will do them.”</p><p>She bit her lip, and he grinned like the devil. “So eager already, little witch? It hasn’t even been 24 hours yet since the ball.”</p><p>She smiled wryly and her cheeks blazed red. Tom wasn’t sure who this new version of Hermione was, but if he’d thought he couldn’t be more enamored of her, he was swiftly standing corrected.</p><p>“I have to go soon,” she breathed, leaning back against his chest.</p><p>He wrapped his arms around her middle. “Dumbledore?”</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>A beat of silence.</p><p>“Tom?”</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>“Would you want to come? With me… to have tea with Dumbledore sometime?”</p><p>A moment passed.</p><p>“I mean, not today, or anything,” she added. “Just… sometime. I know you don’t like him, but…”</p><p>He took a deep breath. “Sure.”</p><p>She settled back into his arms, content. “Good.”</p><p>“Not today, though. I have to track down a photographer.”</p><p>“Right.”</p><p>The thunder rumbled and the rain started up again, falling like a curtain outside the window.</p><p>Tom kissed her hair. “We will figure this out, Hermione…</p><p>I promise you.”</p><p><br/>

<p>Winnie awoke on Monday morning in one of the guest rooms of Malfoy Manor.</p><p>She sat up in bed, gazing through the French doors which led out onto the third floor balcony. It had been raining for two days, and thunder cracked deafeningly in the skies, rumbling through the moors that stretched out before Malfoy Manor.</p><p>Dark gray clouds hid the morning light. Winnie sat up in bed, then caught sight of a figure leaning against the wall beside the balcony doors.</p><p>He blinked his gaze to hers. </p><p>She rubbed her lips together. “Good morning.”</p><p>His eyes roamed her where she lay beneath the sheets. “Good morning.”</p><p>He looked away, his eyes fixed on the gray storm clouds in the distance. </p><p>Winnie watched him, observing the way he blinked, his jaw tensing and eyes narrowing in thought. She wondered what he was thinking, but he’d rarely tell her. He was the strong, silent type, and though she was shy, she was usually his opposite, both feisty and opinionated when she felt comfortable with someone.</p><p>She’d felt comfortable with him once. For a short period of time. </p><p>Now he felt like a stranger, aloof and closed off.</p><p>He wore a simple white crewneck shirt, tucked into pinstriped trousers. His brown curls were tousled from sleep and reminded her of the way she’d gripped them the night before. They’d spent two nights holed up in this room since Ostara. </p><p>They couldn’t go to her home, and they certainly couldn’t show up at the Rosier Estate.</p><p>She ran her hands over her own waist length hair, smoothing its pale strands. “I suppose I should go.”</p><p>He blinked, then nodded, his eyes still fixed on the sky.</p><p>She stood and dressed. He turned and leaned back against the wall as he watched her in silence.</p><p>She stood there, wearing the same gown she’d worn to the ball, her hair a mess and cheeks flushed. </p><p>Their eyes met. </p><p>He reached for his velvet jacket. “Can I see you home?”</p><p>She shook her head, twisting her wand in her hands. “No, I can fare just fine on my own.”</p><p>A beat of silence ensued.</p><p>“I know you can, Win.”</p><p>His brown eyes smoldered like coals, bestowing upon her their intensity.</p><p>She didn’t know what to say to that, so she stayed silent.</p><p>He crossed the room to stand before her, slipping an arm around her waist. “Can I see you again soon?”</p><p>Winnie’s heart twisted in her chest.</p><p>“I don’t think that’s a good idea, Edward.”</p><p>His thumb stroked her lower back.</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>She rolled her eyes. “You know why, you daft nunce.”</p><p>His lips twitched. “Watch your mouth, witch.”</p><p>“I will not.”</p><p>He gripped her waist roughly. “Begging to be silenced, hmm?”</p><p>Her mouth twisted into a reluctant smile, but she pushed against his chest. “Enough of that. The fun’s over with.”</p><p>His smile disappeared, his expression fading into torturous disquiet.</p><p>His Adam’s apple bobbed. “I need you, Winnie.”</p><p>“Then marry me, you fucking arse.”</p><p>The muscles in his cheeks tensed. His eyes flicked to hers, but she returned his gaze with steely resolve. </p><p>“Or let me go,” she whispered.</p><p>He blinked, gritting his teeth. “You know I can’t do that.”</p><p>“Which one?”</p><p>“Both of them.”</p><p>She gave him a sympathetic smile. “Then I suppose your work is cut out for you.” She sighed. “I have to go. I have a lot of work to do… for the factory.”</p><p>Rosier bit the inside of his cheek. “Do you like her? Dumbledore’s daughter.”</p><p>Her eyes brightened, their tragic romance momentarily forgotten. “She’s magnificent… and so kind. I hope we become friends.”</p><p>He nodded and looked away, continuing to bite his cheek.</p><p>Her seafoam green eyes searched his face. “I know you probably don’t care for her politics…”</p><p>He didn’t respond, he just continued to rub the small of her back with his thumb, deep in thought.</p><p>She watched him for a minute, then reached up and cradled his cheek with her hand, letting her fingers slip into the brown curls at his temples. She stood up on her tiptoes and pressed a kiss to his cheek. “I love you, Edward.”</p><p>Then she was gone, ripping herself from his grip and stealing away from him, silent as a specter…</p><p>… but Edward didn’t want Winnie Haywood to be merely a ghost from his past.</p><p>He was terrified she would haunt him for the rest of his life.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Rosier sat in the library of Malfoy Manor before a crackling fireplace.</p><p>Tom sat across from him, garbed in black from head to toe, his ankle crossed over his knee. An old leather-bound book, three times the average book’s size, lay open in his lap.</p><p>Rosier stared into the fire.</p><p>After a few minutes, Tom looked up, eyes narrowed and blinking as if deep in thought.</p><p>“Rosier, have you ever heard of an object called the Ribbon of Life?”</p><p>Rosier’s eyes flicked to Tom. “Doesn’t sound familiar, my Lord.”</p><p>Tom nodded, and returned to his book.</p><p>A few more minutes went by. </p><p>Rosier cleared his throat. </p><p>“Forgive me if I’m overstepping, my Lord, but… are you… are you courting Hermione Dumbledore? I saw you with her on the balcony. The others have… said things, as well.”</p><p>Tom’s eyes paused their sliding back and forth, and there was a distinct tightening of the skin around his eyes, a stilling of his breathing.</p><p>At length, he lifted his head, running his tongue over his top teeth. “I’m not at liberty to say.”</p><p>Rosier snorted. Their eyes met. Tom’s lips twitched in an almost smirk.</p><p>Silence ensued.</p><p>After a bit, Tom’s black eyes cut toward Rosier with all the slyness of a serpent. “What happened to Winnie Haywood?”</p><p>Rosier’s eyes slid to Tom. He rubbed the stubble on his cheeks, and took a deep breath. He couldn’t seem to find words to answer the query.</p><p>Tom promptly closed his book, uncrossing his legs as he adjusted. “Marry her. I don’t have time to deal with a lovesick Death Eater.”</p><p>“Marrying her will create more problems.”</p><p>“It won’t.”</p><p>Rosier’s eyebrows drew forward. “That’s easy for you to say…”</p><p>Tom cocked an eyebrow sharply. Rosier swallowed.</p><p>“I just mean-“</p><p>“I know what you mean. I have no family. No inheritance. No estate. No legacy to destroy.” He paused. “I’m a half-blood. The very kind your family refuses to inter-marry with.”</p><p>“I don’t mean to cause offense, my Lord-“</p><p>Tom waved him away impatiently, dismissing his apology.</p><p>“What’s the point of a legacy,” Tom began, “Of <em> power… </em> if you can’t have what you want?”</p><p>Rosier was quiet, staring back at Tom. After a few moments, he spoke. “You really believe pureblood numbers are dying out?”</p><p>Tom inclined his head. “I think the evidence rather speaks for itself. Don’t you?”</p><p>Rosier exhaled through his nose, looking back to the flames.</p><p>Tom withdrew his wand and twirled it deftly in his fingers. “Our elders get caught up in tradition, and they let prejudices cloud their intellect. It is up to us to pursue progress.” He looked at his friend. “Rosier.”</p><p>He drew the younger wizard’s attention. </p><p>“I will be the most powerful wizard to ever live.”</p><p>“I believe you.” Rosier swallowed. “I’ve never heard of a wizard being able to apparate like that. I don’t know if even Merlin could’ve done what you did.”</p><p>Tom chuckled. “That, my friend, is only the start.”</p><p>“You frighten me, Tom.”</p><p>Tom’s eyes slid toward Rosier, but he chose to ignore the use of his given name. “Let me tell you something, Rosier. You, my friend, need to take control of your life. You’re letting it all happen to you. You worry about your father, but <em> you </em> are the future of the Rosier family. There’s no one else.” Tom reached in his pocket and withdrew a black and gold ring, which he twirled around his finger. “Power is all about leverage, and you have quite a lot of it. Use it… to get what you want. You’ll be glad you did.” He smiled sinisterly. “Daddy dearest isn’t going to disown you, Rosier. He’s terrified you’ll realize that.”</p><p>Rosier was quiet, but his eyes were keen and alert, more than Tom had witnessed in months. </p><p>“What about you, my Lord? Are you going to… marry Miss Dumbledore?”</p><p>Tom gazed down at the ring he held and smirked. “Oh, I’m going to do a lot more than marry her.”</p><p>Rosier blinked, trying to decipher Tom’s meaning, but he thought it best not to ask.</p><p>“Tell me, Rosier, why did Dolohov cast <em> morsmordre </em>?”</p><p>“I don’t know, my Lord.” He bit the inside of his cheek. “Something’s… not right. I wouldn’t trust him.”</p><p>Tom smiled. “I don’t. You know what the muggles say, don’t you Rosier?”</p><p>Rosier shook his head.</p><p>“Of course you don’t. I tweaked it a little.” He winked. “Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer, so that you can shove them into the coffin you’ve built for them.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p><br/>
Hermione walked into the auror department feeling a bit disoriented but nonetheless, prepared to handle her share of the load in dealing with the international breaches. She immediately sat down at her cubicle and began to sort through the stack of files containing notes, evidence, and headlines.</p><p>When her eyes fell on the headline from Saturday, her mouth went dry.</p><p>She hadn’t checked the papers since the morning before Ostara. </p><p>There on the front page, was a moving photograph of an image she knew too intimately.</p><p>A glowing skull lit up the sky, and from its mouth slithered a ghastly looking serpent.</p><p>She grit her teeth.</p><p>Hermione had known it, but to see it so blatantly displayed in black and white on the front page of the Prophet made her question Tom.</p><p>It made her question their relationship.</p><p>But that was just it, wasn’t it? He wouldn’t be honest with her until she was honest with him. Was it a trap? She couldn’t know for sure.</p><p>Still… she’d told him she would put his death eaters in Azkaban. She was resolved to do everything she could to make good on that promise, but would it risk Tom if she did? </p><p>Then there was his threat to kill the Minister.</p><p>How would he accomplish all of this without risking himself and her too?</p><p>She sighed, staring at the paper.</p><p>He was going to make her job incredibly difficult.</p><p>But since when had Tom Riddle <em> not </em> made her life harder?</p><p>The door to the meeting room opened, and Dufresne walked out in quick, purposeful strides. His wand was sheathed in his shoulder harness and the expression on his face was nothing short of serious.</p><p>“I need every auror to report to the meeting room immediately.”</p><p>Hermione stood, taking the most important documents with her, but she was stopped as he approached her desk. “Good weekend, Dumbledore?”</p><p>She gave him a wry smile. “I imagine it was better than yours.”</p><p>“Obviously.” He looked her up and down, and she suddenly felt tremendously self-conscious. </p><p>Was it the fact that she’d spent the weekend shagging her ex-boyfriend two weeks after kissing her boss? </p><p>Hermione wasn’t used to these sorts of predicaments, but they seemed to be happening quite often since she’d found herself in the past. She supposed she’d had little time for romantic entanglements when faced with the dangers of war.</p><p>She wasn’t sure which was more alarming. </p><p>His eyes fell to her throat, and Hermione self consciously pulled her collar up tighter around her neck. She prayed he couldn’t see the purple marks Tom had purposefully left on both sides of her neck.</p><p>His eyes lingered, then rose to meet hers. </p><p>“I see you’ve briefed yourself.”</p><p>“Yes, sir.”</p><p>The room had cleared out, leaving the two of them standing in the cubicle. </p><p>He pointed to the photograph in <em> The Daily Prophet </em>.</p><p>“I hate to ask you questions about things that would only pertain to your knowledge, specifically, but I cannot help myself in this case. Only know that you don’t have to answer if you think it best.” His icy blue eyes met hers. “Do you recognize this?”</p><p>Hermione’s eyes flicked to the dark mark. She swallowed, then answered slowly, “I know the spell that casts this.”</p><p>He blinked, his face as guarded as ever. “What is the spell?”</p><p>“<em> Morsmordre </em>.”</p><p>His cheek muscles tensed. “You’d recognize it then, if we performed Prior Incantato?”</p><p>Her eyebrows rose, but she merely nodded.</p><p>“Good. Come join the meeting, Dumbledore.”</p><p>He flicked his eyes over her once more, taking in her smart caramel-colored skirt suit, the silk blouse under the cropped jacket, the lace up pumps, and her dark red lips.</p><p>“You look nice,” he added as an afterthought, but before she could say anything, he’d turned and walked away.</p><p>She took a deep breath, and realized that an uncomfortable conversation was on the horizon.</p><p>She wished it had been Gaspard.</p><p>But it wasn’t.</p><p>It was Tom Riddle, for her, and it probably always would be.</p><p>Strange, how this alternate timeline had rearranged her entire life, turning a foe into a lover.</p><p>Hermione found that even <em> she </em> was a much different version of herself in this time, and it led her to question time itself, and how people could be transformed so dramatically by minor sets of circumstances.</p><p>Could she be the one to alter the course of Tom’s life?</p><p>She put the thoughts from her mind, and followed Gaspard into the meeting.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>“But we aren’t 100% sure it was polyjuice, are we?”</p><p>“No,” said Myra Grimblehawk, “But it’s unlikely to be transfiguration.”</p><p>“But how did they get our hair?” asked McLaggen. “Surely it wasn’t someone who works here? Or in the ministry?”</p><p>The thought was disconcerting… that it could’ve been someone they knew. </p><p>Hermione was aware, of course, that it was likely one of Tom’s plants in the ministry. She knew that Mulciber worked for the ministry. But she couldn’t say that. In fact, she had to act as if she didn’t know Tom was behind this, and she had to treat this case as if she’d never come from the future and had no special knowledge.</p><p>It was the only fair way to handle it.</p><p>But Hermione would still have his Death Eaters arrested, if she could, and if Tom also was taken into custody as well… that was his own fault, wasn’t it? Tom orchestrated this terrorist attack knowing Hermione worked for the DMLE.</p><p>Was it a test of her loyalty?</p><p>Surely not.</p><p>Hermione seethed inside, frustrated that he’d put her in this position. He truly deserved to be chucked in Azkaban, and let him try to break himself out.</p><p>“But why on earth would they polyjuice themselves to look like aurors? Surely they knew nobody would believe the entire auror department did this.”</p><p>“To send a message,” Hermione said. “It was a joke. They aren’t afraid of us.”</p><p>Dufresne nodded slowly. “Whoever did this… they believe they are really the ones in power. Not the ministry. Or they aim to be, anyway. It’s very clear the perpetrators are against the statute of secrecy.”</p><p>Hermione looked around, only just realizing that there was half the number of aurors on deck. “Where is everyone?”</p><p>“Zabini is in Bangladesh,” said McLaggen. “Pickering is in Paris, tracking down muggles and retrieving their memories, working with the French ministry. Vane is at a meeting with Confederation officials.” He sat back and sighed. “It’s a mess.”</p><p>“We are currently working with the wand registry department to analyze the wand descriptions,” said Dufresne. “We’ve used the memories of muggle witnesses to determine the possible wand woods of the attackers.”</p><p>He handed her a parchment with rough sketches of the wands, their possible woods and approximate measurements, along with a list of the registered wands that matched. </p><p>Thankfully, she didn’t see Tom’s name on the list.</p><p>She did, however, see MacNair… Dolohov… Rosier… Malfoy… and Nott.</p><p>Along with about two hundred other names.</p><p>Mulciber and Avery were not on the list, but that didn’t mean they weren’t involved. It just meant they’d gotten lucky and their wands hadn’t been accurately pegged.</p><p>Hermione gazed at the list, then she asked, “Where did the witnesses say they went after they cast their respective spells?”</p><p>“They disapparated. Right in front of the muggles.”</p><p>“How did they get there so quickly?” asked Zyrus Broadmoor. “It would take days to apparate to most of these locations, and portkeying is very difficult and illegal. The ministry would likely know if an illegal Portkey was set up.”</p><p>Her brows drew forward sharply. “But… it’s believed that they are British?”</p><p>Dufresne shook his head. “We don’t know. It’s likely, since they chose to masquerade as our aurors. But they could’ve had help from locals. We have no way of knowing, but we are hoping that they aren’t part of an international move against the statute. If they are contained to Britain, that would be a good thing.”</p><p>“Then what will this list do? If we have no way of being sure.”</p><p>“It’s a start,” he said curtly. “Sometimes, various pieces of evidence have no use apart from each other. But when pieced together, they paint a clearer picture.”</p><p>The room grew quiet as the aurors poured over their files and documents, examining each eyewitness account, each spell, each report and piece of evidence, searching for something that would stand out.</p><p>“But of course,” Hermione whispered. “It’s a start.”</p><p>Dufresne’s eyes were already on her, watching her carefully. “You have something to say, Dumbledore?”</p><p>“May I suggest something? Perhaps it may lead to another piece of the puzzle.” She bit her lip. “It might seem too simple, or it may lead nowhere, but to me it seems like the logical place to start. How many potions shops are there in London? Polyjuice is illegal to sell to the general public, but aren’t potions shops required by the ministry to keep record of the purchases of certain ingredients? If I’m correct in my thinking, Polyjuice requires two rare ingredients… Boomslang skin and Bicorn Horn. Wand identification is required in order to purchase Boomslang skin. Boomslang is only found in South Africa, it’s a rare ingredient. It’s not something found in your typical potions cabinet.” She paused, deep in thought. </p><p>Dufresne’s eyes narrowed. “They would have to be daft to purchase polyjuice ingredients at a public potions shop… anyone planning something like this had best get it from the Trader’s Guild.”</p><p>Hermione shrugged. “But that’s just it, isn’t it? They may not have thought they’d be suspected. Perhaps they took the risk, thinking it would be too obvious to even be investigated.”</p><p>Dufresne rubbed his chin thoughtfully. “It’s a logical course of action, in any case. Leave no runestone unturned. Walk with me, Dumbledore.”</p><p>Hermione stood and followed him to his office. “The shops should turn over their records for the past several months. Polyjuice only stays good for a short period of time, and it takes a month to brew it. I doubt there are many in London purchasing those ingredients. You can take the shop’s wand log and cross reference it with the wand registries you’ve pulled.”</p><p>Dufresne looked at her for a moment, then pulled his wand from its holster and paged his assistant. “Miss Parkinson, get me a list of every potions shop in London. Miss Dumbledore and Mr. Bones will be accompanying me to pay them all a visit.”</p><p>“But, you’re going yourself?” Hermione asked, surprised. “Don’t you have more important things to do? Eustace and I can certainly handle it.”</p><p>He took a deep breath, then exhaled sharply. “This is currently the most important thing. This is one case I’ve got to solve, Hermione. We don’t need the confederation breathing down our necks. That can get nasty very quickly, and then we’ll have Minister Tuft to deal with. She’s already driving me mad.”</p><p>Hermione’s lips turned up at the thought of what Tom had promised to do, but then she caught herself and her eyes widened.</p><p>Was Tom’s lack of morals rubbing off on her? Had she actually almost relished the thought of Tom killing Tuft?</p><p>Horrified, Hermione followed Dufresne out of the office.</p><p> </p><hr/><p><br/>
They checked all the smaller outlying shops before proceeding to visit the larger, more prominent ones.</p><p>They visited the apothecaries in Diagon Alley and Carkitt Market, and whilst there had been a few wizards who had purchased Boomslang skin a few months prior, their wands didn’t match any of the wands on the list. Still, they took the wand logs all the same, in case any further evidence surfaced.</p><p>Last on the list was Mr. Mulpepper’s Apothecary. It was located on Knockturn Alley.</p><p>“Hermione.”</p><p>“Yes, sir?”</p><p>Dufresne flicked his eyes at her, then at Bones. “If any of the shops are involved, it’s this one. They engage in the bartering of many illegal ingredients and substances. We give them quite a hard time of it. We’ve shut them down a few times, actually. Just let me talk to him, and you observe.”</p><p>They entered the dimly lit shop.</p><p>This was not your average potions shop. It was clear from the various kinds of ingredients lining the shelves, that the majority of the items in stock were used in brewing more dangerous draughts. </p><p>“Hello? Mr. Mulpepper?” Dufresne shouted, his voice booming through the small shop.</p><p>A few moments later, an older gentleman with a few greasy strings of red hair combed over his liver spotted head, emerged from the back of the shop.</p><p>“Ah, blast, it’s you again! Somehow I knew I’d see you here soon.”</p><p>“I wonder why?” asked Dufresne, lips twitching.</p><p>“No idea.”</p><p>Dufresne rolled his eyes. “I need to see your wand logs. Since November.”</p><p>The old man’s eyes sharpened an instant, and he cleared his throat. “Certainly, ah… be right back.”</p><p>Hermione’s eyebrows drew forward, but she stayed quiet. She continued to look around the shop as they waited, and her eyes fell on a glass case containing the Boomslang skin.</p><p>After what seemed like an eternity, the owner returned from the back office. “Your wand logs, sir.”</p><p>Dufresne took the parchments and looked them over for a few moments before looking back to Mulpepper. “Are these forged?”</p><p>The old man looked aghast, comically so. “Why, of course not! What do you take me for?”</p><p>“These look rushed, the ink is fresh. The ink tone should vary. Don’t <em> bloody </em> piss me off today, Mulpepper. Get me the original wand logs.”</p><p>The man’s beady eyes began to dart around, and tears of sweat began to roll down his forehead. “Now, Mr. Dufresne, I have certain patrons that come to me for good reason-“</p><p>“And those patrons aren’t going to mean fuck all if your shop is permanently closed. Get me those logs.”</p><p>The man swallowed, his eyes taking on a crazed look of panic.</p><p>Dufresne gazed at him sternly for a moment, then he leaned forward across the desk. “What say we strike a deal? Perhaps the DMLE will turn a blind eye to your backroom dealings for a time.”</p><p>The old man’s eyes flicked to his, and it was clear that his interest was piqued. “What dealings?”</p><p>Dufresne’s jaw flexed. “All of them. For a time. Not forever.”</p><p>The old man swallowed again, then ran a hand over his wrinkled forehead. “Say, uh, perhaps I may have grabbed the wrong log. Let me see.”</p><p>He disappeared into the back room once more.</p><p>Dufresne took a deep breath, rolled his eyes, and shoved his hands in his pockets while he waited.</p><p>Fairly quickly, the man returned. </p><p>“Ah! Haha,” he laughed breathily. “Here it is! Forgive my mistake. My eyes are not what they used to be.”</p><p>Dufresne gave him a scathing look, but took the wand log. He analyzed it for a few moments, then his eyes narrowed.</p><p>He looked back to Mulpepper, who stood by nervously, ringing his hands. “Mulpepper, do you remember these sales of Boomslang skin?”</p><p>The old man’s eyes widened. “I, uh…”</p><p>“Cooperate with us, and I’ll owe you a favor. I need you to be honest with me. Might I remind you, that lying to us can result in arrest and a trial.”</p><p>The man gulped. </p><p>“December fifteenth, you sold a heavy stock of Boomslang skin to a pair of wizards. What do you recall?”</p><p>The owner cleared his throat. “I uh… they came in asking for Polyjuice… I told them I definitely <em> do not </em>sell it under the table anymore, since you shut us down last September. They demanded it. I told them I don’t even brew it anymore, and of course, it takes a month to do so. Then they asked for all the ingredients to brew it… they told me not to keep any records that they were here. Of course, I did, since you told me last year that another infraction would have me shut down for good.” He looked defeated. “I’d hoped you wouldn’t come sniffing around.”</p><p>Dufresne nodded brusquely. “Thank you, Mr. Mulpepper. That is all. Come.” He gestured for Bones and Hermione to follow him out of the shop. Before they left, he turned back and muttered, “If I return, you will cooperate. Is that understood?”</p><p>The man’s eyes were sharp and furious, but he nodded his assent.</p><p>Dufresne tucked the scroll into his jacket, then reached for both their hands. “Sidelong apparation. We need to get back quickly.”</p><p>Bones and Hermione took his hands, and suddenly, with a cracking sound, they were standing in Dufresne’s office once more.</p><p>Hermione’s mouth fell open in surprise. “You can apparate directly into the Ministry?”</p><p>He nodded curtly. “I’m one of the few. Perks of being the head of Magical Law Enforcement.”</p><p>The door cracked open, and Peoria Parkinson stuck her head in with a simpering smile. “I thought I heard you. There’s a Miss Baron here to see you, from The Daily Prophet.”</p><p>“Tell her to wait. We are working on something very important at the moment.”</p><p>“Yes sir.” The door clicked closed.</p><p>Dufresne looked pointedly at Hermione and Eustace. Then he withdrew the parchment.</p><p>“Have you got the wand registry list, Hermione?”</p><p>“Yes, sir.”</p><p>“I need you to check for the names Dolohov and Rosier.”</p><p>Hermione’s eyes widened. Her heart sped up. She already knew they were on the list. </p><p>“They’re on the list, sir.”</p><p>She handed him the parchment. His eyes scanned it, then he muttered, “I’m going to have to get a wand warrant to search their wands. This is brilliant, Dumbledore. Great work.”</p><p>She watched as Gaspard left her to obtain a warrant request form. </p><p>She watched him go, desperately hoping that this wouldn’t lead back to Tom.</p><p>She’d only just discovered how much he meant to her.</p><p> </p><hr/><p><br/>
“You want me to grant you a wand warrant?” Tuft asked icily, her eyes on the request form before her. “You do realize these are the heirs of two very high profile families.”</p><p>“Do you want the case solved or not, Minister?”</p><p>She glared at him, but hid it behind a sweet smile. “Of course, Mr. Dufresne. This case is top priority.”</p><p>“If a warrant isn’t granted due to this evidence, which is more than sufficient, I may have to bring it before the Wizengamot.”</p><p>Her eyes sharpened like blades. “So… let me get this straight. You think this entire operation was headed by these two young gentlemen? They’re quite young.”</p><p>“No,” he said tersely. “I don’t think they headed it. I think they were following orders.”</p><p>She lifted her teacup primly and took a sip. “Whose orders?”</p><p>“I don’t have sufficient evidence to make accusations.”</p><p>“But off the record?”</p><p>He crossed his arms over his chest and stared at her, his face a mask. “Tom Riddle.”</p><p>Her eyebrows rose and she froze, teacup in hand. She looked at him, blinked, and then looked down at the form before her.</p><p>“You said… Tom Riddle?”</p><p>Gaspard nodded stoically.</p><p>“What makes you think so?”</p><p>“Instinct.”</p><p>She cleared her throat delicately and sat her teacup down. “You believe these two are followers of his?”</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>She examined the form and the evidence she’d been presented with. “Will this arrest somehow help you to capture Riddle?”</p><p>“It’s a definite possibility.”</p><p>Tuft gazed at him, and then back at the paper. She swallowed tightly, and then reached for her wand. With a quick flick of her wrist, her elegant signature appeared on the form in glowing gold script as it traced across the paper. Then it faded to black.</p><p>“Wand warrant granted.”</p><p>Dufresne inclined his head, then stepped forward and snatched the form from her desk, losing no time as he made haste to the elevator.</p><p> </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Hermione was seated on her garden terrace on a balmy spring morning, two days after the arrest of Edward Rosier and Maximillian Dolohov. She had not heard from Tom since.</p><p>On Tuesday, the two wizards were brought in for questioning and their wands confiscated by the DMLE. When performing Prior Incantato, it was revealed that Dolohov had cast both the <em> bombarda maximus </em> and <em> morsmordre </em>, the spells which had resulted in the breaches in France.</p><p>The search of Edward Rosier’s wand had resulted in a few spells which may or may not have been incriminating. Despite the ambiguity of his spell work, he was apprehended on the basis of his connection to Dolohov in purchasing Polyjuice ingredients. Eyewitness accounts stated that the breaches in Paris had been carried out by a pair of wizards, so Dufresne made it clear to Rosier that unless he revealed the name of the witch or wizard who orchestrated the attacks, he would likely be incriminated and imprisoned in Azkaban for his connection to the breaches.</p><p>Rosier remained silent, eerily so.</p><p>A physical examination uncovered magical etchings on their forearms, revealing a skull with a serpent exiting its mouth.</p><p>The wizards would give no explanation as to what these marks meant.</p><p>Investigative legilimency yielded no memories of the events, and the DMLE reports recorded that the wizards had seemingly been obliviated.</p><p>Hermione sat at the little wrought iron table on her terrace, wearing a black robe trimmed with lace, her legs crossed and a tea cup in her hand. </p><p><em> I won’t contact him until he contacts me </em>, she thought. </p><p>This would be the real test of their relationship.</p><p>Hermione was relieved to know that neither wizard would give Tom up.</p><p>She decided she would give Tom the chance to explain to her why he had orchestrated the breaches. Hermione didn’t recall anything like this ever having happened in the original timeline, so how could her presence have changed his actions that much?</p><p>It didn’t make sense.</p><p>Her brows were furrowed and she was deep in thought when her owl, Perdita, flew in with the morning post. She perched on the table as Hermione took the bundle of papers from her beak.</p><p>She untied the parcel and lifted the first paper from the stack, and then her heart stopped beating.</p><p>There, on the front page of <em> The Daily Prophet</em>, was a moving photograph of her and Tom.</p><p>She watched from the aerial view of the photographer as she and Tom stared into each other’s eyes, then Tom moved in for a kiss.</p><p>Her stomach turned flips.</p><p>The headline read: <em> Riddle &amp; Dumbledore: Feud Forgotten in Favor of Budding Romance!</em></p><p>Hermione’s mouth went dry and she blinked.</p><p>Hastily, she rifled through the stack of papers until she found a copy of <em> Rumours</em>!</p><p>The same photograph was on the front page, but the headline was less favorable. </p><p>
<em>Dumbledore, a Fraud? Secret Romance with Sworn Enemy!</em>
</p><p>The arrest of Rosier and Dolohov appeared to have taken a back seat, as it appeared on the bottom of the page in smaller print.</p><p>Hermione sat the papers down and dropped her head into her hands. Once again, nothing could be simple.</p><p>She’d dealt with slanderous rumors for her entire life, it seemed, so she could deal with them once again.</p><p>But it didn’t mean she was happy about it.</p><p>She sighed. “Well, the whole world knows now,” she breathed, resigned.</p><p> </p><hr/><p><br/>
Reporters flocked around the red phone booth when Hermione arrived for work. She pushed through them.</p><p>“Any comment on your relationship with Tom Riddle?”</p><p>“Miss Dumbledore! Were you directly involved in the arrest of Edward Rosier and Maximilian Dolohov?”</p><p>“Was the kiss at the Ostara Ball consensual?”</p><p>“Are you in a secret relationship with Mr. Riddle?”</p><p>“How long have the two of you been involved?”</p><p>“Does this mean there’s nothing going on between you and Gaspard Dufresne?”</p><p>“Are you willing to comment on the political divide between you and Tom Riddle?”</p><p>The questions kept coming, a flood of them, and Hermione’s heart raced, thudding in her chest with anxiety. </p><p>As she attempted to open the door to the phone booth, her savior appeared. Dufresne apparated about a foot away from her, causing the press to fall back a space.</p><p>“Alright, stop hounding my aurors or you will get no press meeting. Step back!”</p><p>The slew of reporters retreated back a few steps, falling somewhat silent as he opened the door to the phone booth and they both stepped in.</p><p>Locked tightly in the phone booth, their eyes met. Hermione’s lips parted, and he swallowed. Then, without a word, he dialed the entry word and they were sucked into the magical vortex. </p><p> </p><hr/><p><br/>
They landed together just within the lobby of the Ministry of Magic. </p><p>He laid a steadying hand on her shoulder as she stumbled. </p><p>She gave him a wry smile. “Never will get used to that.”</p><p>He nodded, but his expression was full of turmoil. “We need to talk, Dumbledore.”</p><p>Her eyes rose to his apprehensively. She nodded in acknowledgement, and he reached out to take her wrist, apparating them into his office.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Once they appeared in his office, Dufresne walked around his desk and took a seat. Hermione’s eyes fell immediately to the paper on his desk.</p><p>The photograph of herself with Tom Riddle stared back glaringly at her.</p><p>She swallowed. </p><p>“Gaspard-”</p><p>“Hermione,” he began, holding up a hand to halt her. “This arrest of Rosier and Dolohov is a great breakthrough in this case and I am greatly impressed and appreciative of your contribution to the investigation. But…” His eyes flicked down to the paper and then back up. “We have reason to believe that Riddle may be the one pulling the strings. Dolohov and Rosier are bait, Hermione.”</p><p>Hermione’s mouth fell open slightly. After a moment of gazing back at him, she closed her mouth and slowly reached up to brush her hair from her face. “I see.”</p><p>He watched her searchingly. “I hope you know that this is a bit out of my hands. Unfortunately, these photographs create a conflict of interest with regards to this case. I have to follow this department’s guidelines. We have plans to lure Riddle using his followers, but unfortunately, as of this morning, I’m not allowed to include you in this investigation moving forward.”</p><p>Hermione pressed a palm to her chest in surprise, her eyebrows shooting up. “I’m off the case?”</p><p>“For now. Until we rule out Riddle as a suspect.”</p><p>She dropped her hand and twisted her fingers together. Her eyes flicked to the paper. “Because of the photographs?”</p><p>Gaspard took a deep breath, then nodded. </p><p>Hermione blinked several times. “I understand.”</p><p>“We can’t risk interference, Hermione. And I-“ He sighed, rubbing his forehead with his fingers. “I don’t want to put you in a difficult position.”</p><p>Hermione rubbed her lips together, digging her nails into her palm painfully. “I see…”</p><p>His glacial blue eyes wandered her face. He sat forward, resting his elbows on the table as he threaded his fingers together. “You’re awfully quiet, Hermione.”</p><p>Her lips quirked to the side, abashed. “Gaspard… it just sort of happened.”</p><p>His face was a mask, as it always was. His lips parted slightly, the only indication of any affect her words might have. “You don’t have to explain.”</p><p>Her eyes met his. “I feel like I do.”</p><p>He sat back, then cleared his throat. “You don’t owe me anything. We established that. I always knew there was a possibility this might happen.” His eyes fell to the paper and he scooped it up, and threw it in the trash. “You’ve done nothing wrong,” he said quickly.</p><p>Hermione stood before him, feeling very small. Despite the mask of his features and the deep brusqueness of his voice, she thought she detected a hint of pain, or perhaps it was regret. </p><p>There was nothing Hermione could do to fix it.</p><p>Hermione cleared her throat. “So I should… work on other things, then?”</p><p>He nodded hesitantly. “There are other aspects of this case you’ll be assigned to. However, this morning’s meeting you’ll be excluded from… and the stakeout.”</p><p>Her mouth fell open. “Stake out…”</p><p>He nodded once. “The other aurors are instructed to keep the details to themselves.” He paused. “Hermione… I’m sure you can keep your feelings separate from your job, but we can’t take the risk, and I am required to follow the rules.” A muscle in his jaw jumped. “The photograph is unfortunate. Bad timing.”</p><p>She didn’t know what to say. “Yes. I suppose it is.”</p><p>Some part of her was relieved that she wouldn’t be caught between Tom and her responsibility as an auror…</p><p>But did they really have a way of incriminating Tom?</p><p>“Are you alright, Hermione?” His voice interrupted her train of thought. “I’m sure you’re used to being in the papers. But I have a feeling this was against your wishes.”</p><p>She swallowed, and nodded quickly. “I certainly wouldn’t have had the world find out like this.” She bit her lip, feeling tremendously awkward talking about her relationship with Riddle to her boss. Especially since they’d shared such a passionate kiss the previous month.</p><p>Silence stretched between them. She could hear the shuffling of feet just beyond the office door, and the whizzing of interdepartmental memos flitting through the air like snitches. Voices were muffled, and Hermione suddenly felt a bit lightheaded.</p><p>“Hermione.”</p><p>Her eyes flicked up to find him staring at her with a concerned expression.</p><p>She took a step forward, then sank into the chair in front of his desk. A few deep breaths, and then, she was able to meet his stare.</p><p>His nostrils flared. “He’s dangerous, Hermione. But you already know that, don’t you?”</p><p>She nodded. “Yes.”</p><p>He watched her for a few moments. “You’re a grown woman, Hermione. I won’t patronize you. But please don’t get into trouble because of him.” His cheek muscles rippled. “You’ll be as great as Dumbledore, a witch of unparalleled strength and influence. Don’t be dragged down by <em> any </em> wizard.”</p><p>She returned his gaze and he ran his tongue over his top teeth as he leaned back.</p><p>“Do you want to know why I’ve rejected the role of Minister?”</p><p>She bit her lip. “I have wondered why.”</p><p>He cocked his jaw to the side. “Because if I leave this position, there’s no one worthy to fill it. We have a disturbing dearth of powerful and moral people in the magical world. The corruption is rampant, Hermione. It’s a festering cesspool of depravity, hidden behind a beautiful facade. Do you know why Albus is put on so high a pedestal?”</p><p>She watched him, eyebrows lifted questioningly. </p><p>“Because he’s the best we’ve got. Our world and its secrets are hanging by a thread… and there is only a handful of witches and wizards keeping our kind safe. The rest are a den of vipers, who care only for power. They don’t care about loss of life, or magical blood. They don’t care about war or millions of muggles dead. We are fighting a great evil, Hermione.” He ran his hand over his chin. “It is a great serpent, sleeping. Waiting to be awoken. Sometimes I get caught up in my business and forget it’s there. Then I have dreams about it.” </p><p>He sighed. “I’m where fate would have me, doing my best to fight against some unseen force. You’re here for a reason, Miss Granger. You’ve done the impossible, and traveled through time and space. Don’t think for a moment it’s for nothing. The universe itself has brought you here. That, in itself, is bigger than whatever you’ve got going on with Tom Riddle. Don’t be dragged down into darkness.”</p><p>Their eyes met, a clashing of two elemental forces, like molten hot lava flowing into a tumultuous ocean. In his eyes, which of a sudden were a clear window, she saw that Gaspard Dufresne possessed depths which she had not realized were there, and for a brief moment, she plumbed them, feeling their magics reverberating around them.</p><p>She suddenly felt the inevitability that he was hinting at, a sense of destiny or providence, as if she were fated to be here and to know him, as if this wizard would always be a force in her life, an ally, a shield. She felt that she knew him in some karmic way, beyond the here and now, beyond even the future and the war.</p><p>The moment was at once serendipitous, and then like a vaporous mist, it faded.</p><p>They were left in an atmosphere of tense silence until Peoria knocked on the door.</p><p>Gaspard’s eyes cleared, becoming a mask once more. “Yes, Miss Parkinson?”</p><p>“A Miss Baron is here again, from the Daily Prophet. She says she will keep coming until you see her.”</p><p>His eyes fell. “Send her in.”</p><p>Hermione stood, but he jumped forward with a hand on her forearm, giving her pause.</p><p>“See Mr. Bones for your assignment, Dumbledore.”</p><p>She blinked, then nodded, and laid her hand over his for a brief moment, barely touching. “Thank you, Mr. Dufresne.”</p><p>With that, there was a wall up between them, one that would likely never come down again.</p><p>She felt a bit of grief as she left his office, a sense of loss deep in the pit of her stomach. But she knew that once the grief subsided, that Tom Riddle was hers, and she was his, and that was bound to be either the most marvelous thing in the world…</p><p>Or the most destructive.</p><p>Only the Fates would decide.</p><p> </p><hr/><p><br/>
“Mr. Riddle… What a pleasant surprise!” Diana Carrow gave him a simpering smile, her lips coated in a dark purple lipstick peeled back, leaving a bit of the deep color staining her teeth.</p><p>“Is it?” He strode forward languidly and took a seat in front of her desk, his arms resting with casual tension on the armrests. He crossed his ankle over his knee and muttered, “That remains to be seen.”</p><p>Her smile fell somewhat, and her lips quirked as a look of faux realization washed over her features. “Oh, but of course. The papers today! I’d almost forgotten, since we’ve been hard at work on tomorrow’s evening edition.”</p><p>Tom smiled, and for some reason, it quite unnerved Diana. “Who sold you the picture?”</p><p>Her eyebrows lifted innocently. “What picture?”</p><p>His eyes narrowed. “Don’t make me ask again.”</p><p>Her lips parted and a nervous laugh issued from between them. Tom’s eyes tracked the movement of her hand beneath her desk. “I don’t know, Mr. Riddle. The photographs were sent anonymously.”</p><p>“Were they?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“There’s no photographer who will anonymously send photographs without payment to a newspaper. Especially photos of significance, as that one is.”</p><p>She cocked an eyebrow. “You’re assuming that<em> The Daily Prophet </em> is the one who issued payment. You would be wrong.”</p><p>“Tell me.”</p><p>She took a deep breath of frustration. “I said the photos were sent anonymously.”</p><p>His jaw muscles tightened. “But you know who, regardless.”</p><p>In the blink of an eye, he had wandlessly disarmed her, causing her wand to fly across the room. Within seconds his wand was in hand and pointed straight at her. Her beady eyes fixed on him like a hawk’s.</p><p>“Mr. Riddle,” she said cautiously. “I’ve heard it whispered that you are under investigation by the DMLE. It wouldn’t do to add other infractions to your record.”</p><p>“Do I look worried to you?”</p><p>She said nothing, eyeing his pale bone-colored wand nervously. It looked like a skeletal appendage as he held it in his hand, the hue of it matching the pallor of his skin.</p><p>When she looked back at him, his eyes blazed red. She stood suddenly, her chair falling back behind her in her haste.</p><p>“I’ve heard of wizards with red eyes,” she said shakily. “They are full of dark magic.”</p><p>“Then perhaps you had better give me a name.”</p><p>“Abnor Bloxham. He is the photographer.”</p><p>He gave her a tight smile. “Not so anonymous, then.”</p><p>She took a step back, her eyes fixed in his crimson irises.</p><p>“Who hired him?”</p><p>“I’m not allowed to say. Go ask the photographer.”</p><p>He scoffed. “Why would I go to all that trouble when I can see the information is in that oversized head of yours?”</p><p>Her chest heaved with her deep breathing, her adrenaline rushing. </p><p>Tom sighed. “Well. I suppose I’d better put this away, shouldn’t I?” He held his wand up and then tucked it into the inner pocket of his robes. “Wouldn’t want them searching my wand and finding anything other than the average everyday charms, right? Since I am under investigation, after all. Good thing I’ve spent years practicing my wandless casting… but truth be told, I’ve had a propensity for it since I was a boy.” He smirked, then lifted his hand aloft, his long, ghostly pale fingers curling into a particular, well-practiced movement.</p><p>“<em>Legilimens</em>.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p><br/>
Tom was angry. He paced in his flat before the windows, running his fingers through his hair in frustration.</p><p>He reached up and loosened his black tie, which was too tight around his neck. He unbuttoned the top buttons of his white shirt and he could all but feel the steam rising from his collar.</p><p>A murderous glint flickered in his red eyes.</p><p>“Soon,” he whispered.</p><p>It didn’t satisfy him. He wanted to wrap his hands around a throat, any throat, and feel the life draining from the corpse, a warm body jerking beneath his hands, blood asphyxiating in its veins, air straining to fill its lungs. He wanted to feel someone’s skin grow cold against his. </p><p>His mind was acting up again.</p><p>Dark magic. It leached from him, seeping out of his very pores like an oily black substance. </p><p>He turned his head this way and that, attempting to loosen the tension, trying desperately to shake the vicious urges from his mind.</p><p>He rested a hand against the windowsill and gazed out over Knockturn Alley, its somber streets a dismal and dreary wasteland in the fading twilight. Tom watched as the shops disappeared down the alley, fading into obscurity. He wanted to kill that damned shop owner, but it would seem entirely too obvious.</p><p>No, he could only afford to kill those who were necessary under the present circumstance.</p><p>But one person would die tonight.</p><p>He reined in his compulsions as best he could. For her sake.</p><p><em> Hermione</em>.</p><p>Just the thought of her seemed to soften his edginess.</p><p>He’d promised to consult her over his actions, vile as she may consider them to be.</p><p>He’d prefer to act alone and leave her in the dark, but that wasn’t how she would want it, was it?</p><p>Marriage. It was both a tempting and a daunting thought.</p><p>Tom had no examples of marital bliss. His own mother had tricked his father into wedding her with a love potion. Some had even whispered that children born under the influence of love potions were incapable of emotion, their psychological dispositions permanently affected by the potion’s magic.</p><p>Tom had sometimes wondered to himself if that were the case, but he’d never thought too hard about it. Until he met Hermione.</p><p>It couldn’t be true. He loved her. He knew that in his soul.</p><p>She was his soulmate, after all, and that superseded and circumvented everything else, in Tom’s mind.</p><p>No, he had to keep her informed, to <em> communicate</em>. He could no longer act as a sole entity.</p><p>He didn’t know how that would work. He had no grid for healthy relationships, or any real idea how to treat a witch properly. He’d simply been muddling through til now, relying on his ability to melt her with words and his hands, letting their issues become lost in the merging of their bodies.</p><p>That is, until they’d run into snags. Then Tom had realized there were things he would have to do differently if he wanted to keep her.</p><p>It was Tom’s instinct to control. He’d controlled everything in his life, his meager amount of power and influence held tightly in his hands.</p><p>He maneuvered and manipulated people, but Hermione was different. She saw through him, a witch who refused to be manipulated by anyone.</p><p>Clever witch. Tom’s chest welled up with something akin to pride, his heart suddenly beating irregularly with the raw force of his attraction.</p><p>He needed to see her.</p><p>His eyes followed the passersby, crawling through the dark twists and turns of the alleyway like ants.</p><p>He had to get Rosier out. Dolohov could rot in a cell for all Tom cared. But Rosier… he wouldn’t fare well in Azkaban.</p><p>Tom gritted his teeth in irritation. Just another complication.</p><p>With a sharp exhale, he turned and escaped to his bedroom. There, he etched the protective runes in a perfect circle across the boards of the old wood floor.</p><p>Then he fell back into his bed and in the same instant, projected his soul into the spirit realm.</p><p> </p><hr/><p><br/>
She was asleep when he materialized in her bedroom. </p><p>Her hired elf Piksy had been out in the sitting room, reading a book by the fireplace while still in her apron, seemingly having finished her work for the evening.</p><p>Tom stared at her as she lay beneath her icy blue comforter, topped with a fur blanket at the foot of the bed. His eyes combed her brown curls, the glowing luster of her tan skin, still warm and deep despite its remaining winter pallor. He measured the even rising and falling of her chest, and he wondered how her day had been. </p><p>Had their photograph in the papers stressed her? Did the press give her a hard time?</p><p>What had she thought when Rosier and Dolohov were brought into custody? Had she realized Tom was behind it?</p><p>Surely she had.</p><p>Tom coveted her thoughts.</p><p>The French door leading from her bedroom out onto the terrace was open, leaving the black starry sky bare and allowing in a light breeze which rustled the voluminous canopy and created a breath of sound in the hush.</p><p>He was considering taking on the body of darkness, if only to check her wards, feeling slightly irritated that she’d left her door open, when he heard a soft sound issue from her lips.</p><p>He looked back, wondering if he’d somehow made a noise and roused her, but he knew that was impossible in his current form.</p><p>She was quiet and still sleeping, but her breathing had picked up. He watched her for a moment, and then she turned her head. Another whimper.</p><p>Then she tossed and turned on her pillow.</p><p><em>Dreaming</em>, he thought. He was tempted to try to penetrate her mind.</p><p>Another whimper, faster breathing, turning.</p><p>He neared the edge of her bed, gazing down at her. </p><p>“No,” she murmured in her sleep, her voice high-pitched with anxiety.  </p><p>He couldn’t rouse her in his current state. </p><p>“Hermione,” he whispered. He wondered if, caught in the spirit world as he was, she could feel him, or sense his presence.</p><p>“No,” she murmured again, more urgently. Tom knelt at her side.</p><p>“Hermione,” he said louder, his voice laced with alarm, but he knew she couldn’t hear him. He didn’t actually have a voice, only an echo reverberating in the spirit world.</p><p>“Tom!” She gave a visceral scream, sitting straight up in bed, fully awake at last.</p><p>Her blood curdling scream made Tom feel the distant pricking of goosebumps along his arms and the back of his neck, a faint impression of the reaction of his body laying in his bed.</p><p>She sat up in the dark, her chest heaving violently, blinking as her eyes adjusted to the darkness.</p><p>She dropped her head in her hands with a choked sob, her limbs and hands trembling. </p><p>Tom reached out for her, but his hand fell through her arm.</p><p>She sat up suddenly, looking around as if she’d felt his ghostly touch. </p><p>As much as Tom wanted to stay, and even considered returning to his body only to come back later, he glanced up at the golden clock covered by a glass dome which sat on her mantle. Little golden spheres magically circled it, and he read the time.</p><p>He had somewhere to be.</p><p>He glanced back at his witch as she sat there, caught in the aftershocks of a nightmare. “I’ll come back later, my love, after I finish slaying your enemies.” His incorporeal eyesight trailed over her tear-stained face, and he leaned in so close that she would have felt his breath on her cheek if he were really there. “Then I’ll slay the monsters in your dreams, as well.”</p><p>Tom stood back and let himself fall through several stories, then he followed the silver cord as it pulled him back through the winding turns of Horizont Alley, back to Knockturn. </p><p>He awoke in his bed, then stood, and smiled. </p><p>He crossed purposefully to his closet, took out a black shirt and changed, then pinned in his gold cufflinks. </p><p>Carefully, he combed back his hair and slung his cloak over his shoulders, then sauntered through the front door of his flat.</p><p>Tom had a date, after all, and he didn’t want to be late.</p><p> </p><hr/><p><br/>
Wilhelmina Tuft was lounging on a peacock blue velvet chaise in her private office at Tuft Manor. The room was large, with checkered marble floors and a regal fireplace connected by floo to the one in her office at the Ministry. She reclined in the sitting area, reading a letter from her son Ignatius, which had arrived by owl earlier in the evening. </p><p>He’d signed the letter, <em> Love, Nate.</em></p><p>Her son was, indeed, the only person she loved in the world.</p><p>Her eyes wandered to the window, where a pastel-painted sunset was fading into twilight, a handful of shy stars peeking through the blue-gray firmament. The looming landscape of the estate crept up to a darkened treeline, which silhouetted like black lace against the dwindling light. </p><p>She folded the letter and held it against her chest as she stood and crossed to the other side of the office. An antique globe opened up into a hidden bar, and she grabbed a crystal decanter filled with gin and poured a glass. </p><p>Aberdeen was off with his latest dalliance. He used to only visit them at their private residences, or hole up with them in some discreet hotel, but he’d become bolder of late, bringing them into his wing of the manor.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed slightly as she took a sip of her gin. He’d hoped she would be too busy with her duties as Minister to notice. They’d fought that evening, and he’d accused her of being cold and overly ambitious. Competitive. A woman without a heart, he’d said.</p><p>“You want to know why I fuck them, Mina? You really want to know?” </p><p>He’d had too much alcohol, and his face was swollen, red as a cherry. </p><p>She’d stared at him with no emotion.</p><p>“Because you’re lifeless… and no one wants to fuck a corpse.”</p><p>He’d snatched his bottle of firewhiskey off the dais and stormed out of the room.</p><p>She should have argued with him, perhaps. Should have chased after him.</p><p>She would have, if she’d cared.</p><p>Wilhelmina had higher pursuits on her mind. Goals and ambitions, for both herself and her son.</p><p>Her son did not belong to Aberdeen, after all. He wasn’t Ignatius’ father, and as yet, her husband had never discovered the truth.</p><p>She intended to keep it that way.</p><p>So she let him have his whores, his distractions, while she built her empire with his fortune.</p><p>A corpse, he said? That was fair.</p><p>She saved her energy for her own affairs.</p><p>She was more secretive about those. Less careless. </p><p>She’d never been rejected until Tom Riddle. </p><p>It was like poison in her veins, how much she’d hoped after him. How much she had even pined, as much as a woman like herself could pine. Wilhelmina had been more careless about Riddle, brought him into the open, even shamelessly promoted him to a level of political status…</p><p>… only to be shut down quite brutally. </p><p>She looked down, just realizing that she was gripping her letter rather tightly, her sharp nails crumpling the parchment.</p><p>She smoothed it again, lovingly, and sat it on her desk.</p><p>Her low heels clacked along the checkered floor, and her fur-trimmed dressing gown dragged along the floor behind her as she stood before the floor-to-ceiling windows. Beyond the gardens of the manor, the faint glow of the magical perimeters acted like a fence, holding the famed Tuft thestrals. She’d been able to see them since childhood, the mysterious and eerie creatures. She’d always hated them, in an inexplicable and irrational way. Perhaps because they had always been drawn to her, followed her like lost puppies, even though they were disgusting, skeletal, rotten meat loving monsters.</p><p>They were omens of bad fortune, after all, and she didn’t like the way they clung to her.</p><p>She sighed and lifted a hand to rest upon the window sill. She hoped Riddle would be arrested and tried. He’d orchestrated the breaches to undermine her administration, Tuft was sure. </p><p>Between Riddle’s brazen crimes and his girlfriend’s interferences, Tuft’s image was sorely lacking with the public. She dragged her fingertips along the glass windowpane, leaving a trail of frost in their wake.</p><p>She’d always had a knack for elemental magic. She could conjure ice and snow from the time she was a little girl, when she first encountered her magic. Her father used to call her his <em> snow princess </em>. </p><p>She’d grown up to become an ice queen.</p><p>Wilhelmina’s soft smile dropped into a cool frown.</p><p>She wanted Riddle in Azkaban. Now, the entire wizarding world knew about Hermione Dumbledore’s involvement with Riddle, and once he went down, so would Hermione. They deserved to burn at the stake together…</p><p>Tuft was working to discover what else the girl might be hiding. She would bring them both down, and then she could sleep at night.</p><p>If Dolohov cooperated, he would be freed, and Riddle imprisoned. Then she could focus her efforts on Hermione. </p><p>It was a shame, really. She had hoped to mold Riddle, to include him in her plans to transform the Ministry, and by extension, the confederation as well. </p><p>But nothing had gone to plan. Riddle had defected, Hermione had poisoned her public image, and even now, there were strong murmurs of dissent in Britain. She felt it everywhere she went, the eyes on her, the whispers. </p><p>They said she was not a strong enough leader. Was it her fault that Dufresne couldn’t catch a criminal? First the Azkaban breach, then there were the articles Hermione released. The people demanded a new wizarding prison. Who better to revolutionize the prison, than the witch who’d commissioned the building of a new bank? That’s what they said.</p><p>Then, there was the robbery of the Historical Society, and now, the international breaches of the statute. It made her, the Ministry, and the DMLE as a whole, look weak. The people murmured that Britain was no longer safe. They feared this “dark wizard gang.”</p><p>Of course, Tuft was sure now who this gang’s leader was. She’d known it all along, in truth, but she’d turned a blind eye. Now, she knew the massive mistake she’d made.</p><p>But no more. It didn’t matter that their political goals matched hers. Riddle was a wild card; he was dangerous, and even worse, he held no loyalties toward his political allies. He had all the makings of a dictator, and his kind of uncanny ability to woo followers would be like a cancer in their society. </p><p>Not to mention he was powerful. <em> Too </em> powerful. Tuft had been greatly mistaken in thinking that he could ever be a puppet. Because of his age, she had underestimated his power.</p><p>But no matter. If Dolohov cooperated, they would have Riddle.</p><p>Tuft smiled to herself. She would always win, in the end. Riddle had met his match.</p><p>A moment later, there was a knock at the door. Her house elf appeared at the door, bearing a silver tray. Upon the tray was a little tin box tied with ribbon.</p><p>“An owl dropped this off, Mistress.”</p><p>“What owl?”</p><p> “Has been here before. A little gray owl.”</p><p>Tuft smiled. That owl belonged to her young assistant, Efren. She had instructed him never to send the owl here, but he didn’t often listen.</p><p>Tuft sighed, but she took the parcel all the same.</p><p>“Away with you,” she muttered to the house elf, dismissing him.</p><p>Tuft untied the ribbon and lifted the lid of the tin. </p><p>He’d sent a box of fudge.</p><p>On a little card branded with Honeydukes’ logo, he’d written a little note. She recognized his messy scrawl.</p><p>
<em> Sweets for the sweet.</em>
</p><p>
<em>P.S. I doubt this fudge will taste as good as you do. </em>
</p><p>
<em>- E.</em>
</p><p> </p><p><em> Bold </em> , thought Tuft. <em> But he’s a bold boy.</em></p><p>With a little smirk, she took a piece of fudge from the tissue paper within the box, clasping it between her long, perfectly manicured nails as she lifted it and popped it into her mouth.</p><p>She chewed and her brows furrowed at the peculiar taste. </p><p>It almost tasted like Alihotsy smelled, but she couldn’t be sure. </p><p>Either way, it was delicious.</p><p>She popped another piece in her mouth and washed it down with a swig of gin.</p><p>Then another knock came at the door.</p><p>“What do you want, Tuppen?”</p><p>The elf was getting on her last nerve.</p><p>The door cracked. “A handsome gentleman is here to see you.”</p><p>Her blood ran cold.</p><p>Her husband may have been bold enough to bring his sexual escapades into their home, but she was not.</p><p>This was quite brave of him.</p><p>She slammed the tin onto her desk and took another drink of gin. </p><p>“Send him in,” she snapped as her vision began to blur slightly. She leaned over the desk, placing both hands on it to keep from stumbling.</p><p>She hadn’t had <em> that </em> much to drink, she was sure of it. All her hard work at the Ministry today must have gotten to her. She’d not been sleeping well, not really. As soon as he left, she would go straight to bed.</p><p>She heard the door open again.</p><p>“Efren,” she began as she whirled around, “how many times have I told-“</p><p>She froze. The handsome man was not Efren.</p><p>Tom Riddle stood in her office, garbed all in black.</p><p>He smiled. “Good evening, Minister.”</p><p>She glared at him, but there suddenly appeared to be two of him. “Get out before I summon the guards.”</p><p>“What guards?”</p><p>“The ones hired to guard my estate, of course.”</p><p>He strode into the room and shut the door, then shrugged. “They’re off duty. Don’t you remember? You gave them the day off.”</p><p>Her eyes bugged out. “I did nothing of the sort!”</p><p>He smirked. “Oh, but you did.”</p><p>Tuft’s throat suddenly felt thick, her tongue like sandpaper. She strained in a breath.</p><p>Riddle sat down on the velvet sofa opposite her desk. “It’s strange how easy it is to murder someone in the wizarding world. A few well placed memory charms, an imperius or two. The muggles are actually much more clever when it comes to catching criminals.” He crossed his ankle over his knee, then retrieved his wand from within his robes and waved it, effectively locking and warding the room. </p><p>Tuft reached for her wand, but he disarmed her in the same instant. She stumbled, falling to her knees. Her head swam, and it appeared the room was tilting sideways. “What have you done?” she croaked through her swollen vocal cords.</p><p>His eyes glowed a fiery red, like the color of embers. He stuck a cigarette between his lips and lit it with a flick of his wand. “I used to steal books, whenever they brought us orphans to that great library in south London. I read a book about those muggle murderers, like Jack the Ripper. I found it fascinating how they got away with it without magic. Though I find most muggles to be quite stupid, some of them are much cleverer than wizards. They’re forced to be, after all.”</p><p>Tuft couldn’t breathe. She tried to suck in oxygen, but her lungs were asphyxiating. “Did you poison me?” she rasped.</p><p>He exhaled a puff of smoke. “No, Minister. I’m rather pleased to see that it worked. Otherwise, I’d have had to use the killing curse, or perhaps even strangle you myself. That would’ve been more satisfying, but we need this to look like an accident, don’t we?”</p><p>“You’re insane.”</p><p>He nodded as he took another drag, his lips wrapped around the cigarette as he muttered, “Very.” He plucked the cigarette from his mouth and held it out between his thumb and forefinger. “I’ll admit I was angry when I found out you’d granted a wand warrant and had my men arrested, but what really sent me over the edge was that photograph in The Prophet.”</p><p>Tuft was crawling now. Crawling to the fireplace, perhaps hoping she could floo away and get help. Tom knew that she would never even reach the powder.</p><p>Her face was turning a gray-blue hue, a thick vein protruding in her forehead, with foam accumulating grotesquely at the corners of her mouth. </p><p>Tom sucked smoke deep into his lungs as he watched her dragging herself across the floor. She paused, seizing violently, and he watched her coldly. “You don’t look nearly as good crawling as my witch does.” He stood and walked nearer, towering over her. “I should’ve killed you long ago. Surprised you’ve toughed it out this long… pun not intended.” </p><p>He knelt over her. “Yes, I would dearly love to strangle you myself, but I fear my girl would be jealous if I put my hands around another witch’s throat.”</p><p>She attempted to lift her eyes to his face, but they rolled back, signaling her near loss of consciousness. He smiled. “I’m going to replace you with Hermione Dumbledore, and that will be your legacy, Minister. So you can die knowing you have nothing to show for all your scheming.” He stood, staring down at her as she jerked in the final throes of death. “Don’t worry, my dear Tuft. I’ll take good care of little Nate.”</p><p>With one last scrape, her nails dragged along the floor. Then, she fell still, her face turned to the side with her cheek pressed against the cold marble.</p><p>Tom rolled her over with his dragonhide boot. The face looking back at him was vacant and windowless, but her eyes were full of fear, that delicious fear that always affected his victims in their last moments. The realization that death was near, a panic-stricken terror. Profound <em> hopelessness</em>. </p><p>Tom had dearly missed that feeling. The feeling of <em> stealing </em>. He’d felt it as a boy anytime he stole one of his fellow orphan’s possessions.</p><p>He always felt it when he stole the life from another’s eyes.</p><p>Something taken, something lost, never to be retrieved.</p><p>Time itself, permanently altered.</p><p>He vanished his cigarette, took a handful of floo powder, and cast it into the fire. The flames leapt, flashing green. He stepped through, intent on searching Tuft’s office top to bottom.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>Hermione woke the next morning to the warmth of sunlight streaming into her bedroom. She rose to consciousness slowly, feeling content, with the heavy sensation of strong arms wrapped around her waist. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her eyes flew open and she looked down to see arms she knew all too well. Regardless, she nearly jumped away, but his arms tightened around her, preventing escape.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good morning,” he said huskily, his voice rough with sleep.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She swallowed, feeling somewhat alarmed. She supposed that unnerved feeling would never go away when it came to Tom. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You…” she gulped. “You broke through my wards?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Obviously,” he chuckled. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Despite herself, she smiled. Despite everything, she was thrilled to wake and find him here. Perhaps she had worried he’d be angry about her part in imprisoning his death eaters. She hadn’t seen him since the day before the arrest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She felt his hand on her hip, guiding her onto her back. Then he climbed over her, and he lowered his mouth to her bare shoulder, then her throat, sucking gently, wetting her skin with his tongue. Hermione began to tremble with anticipation, his scent reawakening memories and a deep desire in her core. His inky black hair was slightly mussed, and she ran her hands through it, savoring the soft feel of it between her fingers. </span>
</p><p>
<span>He lifted his head, and their eyes met. His smiled back at her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I killed Tuft.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione froze, her eyes wide. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The silence was heavy. </span>
</p><p>
<span>He reached out and brushed a stray curl from her face and tucked it behind her ear.  “Is it a dealbreaker?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione swallowed. Before she even realized she was answering, before she’d even really thought it through, she breathed shakily, “No.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>His mouth suddenly took hers, and his tongue was in her mouth, exploring, tasting her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>His fingers bit into her legs as he pulled her thighs apart and settled in between them. She realized in that moment that he was naked, his cock hard and thick, shocking her with its heat against her knickers. </span>
</p><p>
<span>With a growl of frustration and a wave of his hand, he’d vanished them completely. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Then he waved his hand again, and Hermione felt a warmth spreading through her core. She furrowed her brows and twisted her thighs slightly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know the lubrication charm?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course.” He smirked and winked. “I’ve never needed it, have I?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She rolled her eyes, but gasped a moment later as he lifted her and threw her onto her stomach. His fingers wrapped around her hips and jerked her upward onto her knees, then pushed her silky nightgown aside.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I thought it might be necessary this morning, as I’ve no intention of being gentle with you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione’s stomach turned flips. She felt the heat of his cock pressing against her entrance. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Any last words?” he murmured, rubbing her backside admiringly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She turned and gave him a challenging smile. “Don’t go easy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom’s lips curled into a frightening grin.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p>
<span><br/>
Hermione winced slightly as she took her seat at her cubicle later that morning. She had a pile of reports on her desk to go through, and a tray of vials filled with memories siphoned from muggles in various countries. They had been brought by a confederation official this morning and she was tasked with replaying them in the pensieve, then corroborating them with one another, and editing their respective reports appropriately. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She was just getting ready to do so when Dufresne emerged from his office and cleared his throat. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Every auror to the meeting room.” He gave Hermione an apologetic look. “Sorry, Dumbledore.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione felt the eyes of her co-workers on her as they all left their respective cubicles. She felt judged somewhat, but she really couldn’t blame them. They’d all hoped for a romance between her and Gaspard, only to find out she was cavorting with a suspected criminal. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione probably would’ve judged her, too, if the roles were reversed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione barely recognized herself, truth be told, but she decided she was done fighting her heart.</span>
</p><p>
<span>If she wasn’t strong enough not to be corrupted by Tom, then what made her any better than his death eaters? Than Bellatrix Lestrange?</span>
</p><p>
<span>And yet… she was already being corrupted, wasn’t she? She hadn’t even objected when he divulged that he’d killed Tuft. But truth be told, when he’d told her about Tuft’s political views and allegiances, Hermione had been deeply confused. Was Tom no longer on the side of the purebloods? </span>
</p><p>
<span>She sensed that they desperately needed to have a discussion, but she knew he would likely not tell her anything until she revealed the truth to him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The </span>
<em>
<span>whole</span>
</em>
<span> truth. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It gave her chills to think of all that information in the hands of Voldemort.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But </span>
<em>
<span>was</span>
</em>
<span> he Voldemort? To her, he was irreversibly Tom. </span>
<em>
<span>Her</span>
</em>
<span> Tom.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Troubled, she lifted a vial from the tray, but then a thought came to her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She recalled her dream suddenly, in a rush of Dè Ja Vu. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The dream was now just an impression. She’d forgotten the details in the course of the morning.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A dark place, full of despair. Tom lying lifeless on a stone floor.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione shivered, the dream returning to her in bits, and she recalled the way she’d sobbed as she awoke.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She stood, disturbed, and made her way across the empty room to grab a coffee from the auror department’s breakfast bar. There on the surface of the bar, was today’s paper. On the very front page was a photograph of Tom, seemingly taken recently. He was walking into his job at Borgin &amp; Burkes, unaware of the lurking photographer in the alleyway across the street.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The headline read: </span>
<em>
<span>A Riveting Riddle: What We Know About Dumbledore’s Mysterious New Beau!</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione sighed. This was likely not going to end soon. She would have to give some thought to the dilemma, and decide how best to handle it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione took the paper with her, intending to examine the rest of the morning’s news, hoping to perhaps catch an article written by her best friend, Eulessia, when she heard voices from within the meeting room. She paused, then glanced back across the room to where the two interns sat scratching away with their quills.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Just how much evidence did they have against Riddle? </span>
</p><p>
<span>And what were they planning?</span>
</p><p>Hermione’s heart sped up, and her dream once again rose to the forefront of her mind. </p><p>
<span>She blinked several times, then glanced behind her at the office interns. Finding them preoccupied, she reached for the charm on her bracelet. She discreetly engorged it and aimed her wand inside. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Accio</span>
</em>
<span> extendable ears,” she whispered. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When they shot out of the bag and into her waiting hand, she breathed a sigh of relief to know that she did still have a set.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It couldn’t hurt, right?</span>
</p><p>
<span>She surreptitiously cast a disillusionment charm on the ears, and when they blended out of sight, she walked by the door of the meeting room and dropped one, then kicked it underneath the crack between the door and the floor.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She stretched the fleshy channel between the ears until she reached her seat. Then she held the ear to hers and planted it there with a sticking charm. She could hear the muffled voices of aurors muttering, talking over one another. Then she distinguished Gaspard’s voice from the others, his a deep boom as he quieted the group. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’ll each follow the schedule, two aurors stationed at Azkaban at all times, around the clock. We will hope Riddle will take the bait and perhaps we can solve not only this case, but the Azkaban breach as well.” He paused as a deafening roar of murmurs rose, then all at once, they were silenced. “Once we can legally perform legilimency, we can determine the whereabouts of Hausler.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But are you sure its Riddle?” Hermione recognized Andrew Rabnott’s voice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Almost positive, but again, that will depend on the evidence. There’s always a possibility that I’m wrong… but I’d say my track record speaks for itself.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What if Riddle does show at the prison?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dufresne cleared his throat. “You’ll use the emergency summons, which will alert the rest of our department. We are working with the confederation… there are hit wizards on standby for reinforcement. We will capture Riddle, one way or another.” There were murmurs for a moment, then Dufresne finished. “You’ll see Mr. Urquart for your schedule and he will issue your portkeys. Any questions?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a pause, a rustling sound, and then, the scraping of chairs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione casted a wandless accio, summoning the ear to return. Her heart raced as she tucked it back into her bag, then watched as the aurors emerged from the meeting room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She busied herself with the tray of vials, but inside, she was panicking.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Would Tom try to break Rosier and Dolohov out of Azkaban? </span>
</p><p>
<span>If so, she had to warn him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She bit her lip. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But then again… </span>
</p><p>
<span>A lingering fear niggled in the back of her mind. A fear that Tom was manipulating her, that she was being blinded by her feelings.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He </span>
<em>
<span>was</span>
</em>
<span> the most evil dark wizard of the century, was he not? Or was his madness simply due to his descent into the dark arts, the splitting of his soul into seven pieces?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione swallowed, trying to focus on her work, but her anxiety for Tom was an unavoidable distraction.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She began to contemplate a way to warn him without risking her job, when one of the department secretaries burst into the room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The Minister! Minister Tuft! She’s been found dead!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a moment of stunned silence, which lasted only a few moments before the entire office was abuzz. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Two members of the Minister’s cabinet appeared a few moments later, and retreated with Dufresne into his office.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Where? What happened?” asked Myra. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The secretary replied, “I don’t know all the details, but it happened in her home. I imagine you’ll be investigating as soon as Mr. Dufresne comes out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>All heads turned toward the office. Hermione’s heart pounded. She was seriously questioning her choice to become an auror, what with Tom’s choice of hobbies. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Then again, she hadn’t expected their little romance to be rekindled, but here they were… and the clock was counting down to the hour when she would have to tell him </span>
<em>
<span>everything</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Would she be able to do it? Fear pierced her heart.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dufresne emerged from the office, followed by two Ministerial officials that Hermione recognized from the Gringotts meeting. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Bones, McLaggen, Grimblehawk, Rabnott, Zabini…” He paused. “Dumbledore. Come with me. We are going to Tuft Estate.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione sucked in a deep breath, and grabbed her cloak.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p><br/>
“Why are you here, Miss Black?”</p><p>
<span>Walburga Black stood in Borgin &amp; Burkes. It was still early, and Borgin wouldn’t be arriving until after lunch. There were no customers to attend to, so Tom had begun polishing and dusting various objects in the shop with a few flicks of his wand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So I’m Miss Black now? You can’t even call me by my name.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That is your name.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Whatever,” she huffed petulantly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I asked a question.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Max is in Azkaban because of you.”</span>
</p><p>Tom turned to her, adjusting his black tie. “That doesn’t answer my question. You’re going to have to be more specific.”</p><p>
<span>She took a step forward, frustration twisting her features. “What are you going to do about it? He could come out mad, Tom! He can’t be there much longer.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom cocked a brow. “First of all, his being there is his own fault.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Here’s there because of your orders!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He’s there because he didn’t </span>
<em>
<span>follow</span>
</em>
<span> my orders. He stepped out and deliberately disobeyed me, for reasons I still have yet to discover. Secondly… he’s already mad.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you going to get him out or not, Tom?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom ran his tongue over his top teeth. “No. But I will get Rosier out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>What</span>
</em>
<span>?” Walburga cried hysterically. “He’s done everything you’ve asked him to!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He’s caused nothing but problems,” Tom muttered coldly. “And I would watch my tone, if I were you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She scoffed. “You can’t order me around anymore.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not interested in ordering you around. I’m interested in you leaving.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Walburga narrowed her eyes. “You have to get him out. You owe him that much.”</span>
</p><p>“Why do you care so much? Last I heard you were going to marry your cousin.”</p><p>
<span>Walburga swallowed. “I was pregnant, Tom.” She looked down at her hands, fiddling with an emerald ring on her index finger. “I went to see a witch and… well, anyway, it’s gone. I didn’t want to, but… I couldn’t risk my family finding out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom stared at her for several moments. “It was Dolohov’s?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She took a deep breath. “Well, obviously.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom’s jaw tensed. “Does he know about it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her blue eyes flicked up, meeting his. “No… I don’t want him to know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom sighed, taking out a cigarette, which he lit wandlessly. He sucked in a deep drag and muttered, “What do you want from me, Walburga? Want me to get your daft boyfriend out of prison?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He’s your follower, Tom. He was a friend even, once… if you are even capable of friendship, that is.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Smoke spilled from Tom’s mouth as he gazed at her. Walburga felt a coldness crawling over her skin, painting her pale epidermis in a swathe of goosebumps. A shiver ran down her spine.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom sucked in a deep breath through the little paper stick, then pulled it from between his lips, rolling it between his fingers. “I’ll get him out. But only if you pledge your loyalty to me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Walburga heaved a deep breath, then two, then three. “Done.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I want the loyalty of all of the Blacks.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She swallowed. “If… if I can make it so, then I promise.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom’s eyes narrowed. “Stay away from Hermione Dumbledore. If you or anyone else lays a finger on her… I’ll kill you all. I’ll kill Max. I’ll kill little Cygnus. I’ll kill mummy and daddy Black… and I’ll slit Alphard’s throat myself… then I’ll kill you last, after you’ve watched them all suffer. Oh, it will be painful, Walburga, and creative. Especially for Ciggy. I’ll plan something quite ghastly for him.” He expelled smoke from his lungs. “Do you understand?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Walburga’s lips parted. She’d always known Tom was violent. She knew he was dangerous, and he’d made threats before… but this time, with his eyes shifting from black to crimson and back, she knew that he meant it. “Yes,” she nodded, a tremor in her voice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good. Now get out.”</span>
</p>

<h2 class="heading">Confessions of a Dark Lord</h2>
</div>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Hermione stared at the face of the now deceased Minister. Her corpse lay on the checkered marble floor in her expensive clothes, head turned to the side, an expression of raw fear etched into her inanimate features. Her skin was the grayed color of the sky above Azkaban prison, her lips pale and colorless. She was frozen in a position as though she’d been crawling, fingers curled like claws.</p><p>Hermione swallowed thickly. Riddle had done this. He’d admitted it to her, and she hadn’t even objected. Seeing Tuft lying lifeless on the floor of her office made Hermione’s stomach turn flips. It reminded her too well of the bodies that had lain on the floor of the Great Hall. </p><p>That, too, had been Riddle’s doing.</p><p>Would death and destruction always follow in his wake?</p><p>Moreover, would Hermione be able to reconcile herself to that reality?</p><p>The magical forensics team was working tirelessly on the scene. Hermione was waved over by Cash Zabini. </p><p>Gaspard was interviewing Tuft’s house elf, Tuppen. </p><p>“It happened right like I told ya, sir. An owl delivered a box… that box there.” The elf gestured to the tin of fudge which still sat open and barely touched. There were two pieces missing.</p><p>Bones and Rabnott went to examine the tin. </p><p>One of the forensic nurses from St. Mungo’s piped up. The aurors turned to look, seeing a set of glowing symbols floating above Tuft’s body as the nurse waved her wand, performing the necessary spells for a magical autopsy.</p><p>“My assessment shows asphyxiation.” She turned to the nurse beside her who held a quill and parchment. “Record visceral congestion via dilation of the venous blood vessels… blood stasis… tiny hemorrhages… cyanosis… and fluidity of the blood. Possible poisoning. I’ll cast a diagnostic spell on the blood, then check it for traces of common poisons. Perhaps an allergic reaction. No signs of strangulation. No signs of struggle.”</p><p>Gaspard gazed at her for a moment, then turned to the house elf. “Were there any other visitors?”</p><p>“No, sir. None.”</p><p>Gaspard made his way over to the desk, where the tin of fudge sat. He lifted the note, read it’s contents, cocked a brow, then sat it back down.</p><p>“Collect this for evidence, Zabini.” </p><p>Gaspard strode over to the house elf and withdrew his wand. The elf involuntarily flinched when he saw Gaspard’s cedar wand. The wizard gazed at the small elf for a moment, then laid a gentle hand on his shoulder. He pressed his wand to the elf’s temple, extracting a long, silvery ribbon: the memory. He deposited it into a vial and corked it.</p><p>“Thank you. That will be all.” He watched as the elf pitter-pattered away on its bare feet.</p><p>Gaspard turned to Hermione. “I’ve got to have a chat with Minister Tuft’s husband. I’m sending McLaggen to escort her son home from Hogwarts. You and Zabini head back and examine the evidence.” He handed her the vial filled with the silvery substance. “We will need to track down the person who sent that card… but discreetly, perhaps.”</p><p>Hermione’s eyes widened, and she nodded, taking the vial carefully from his fingers. </p><p>“Come, Dumbledore,” said Zabini. “The Ministry will be a mess when we get back. Law stipulates there must be an emergency election.” He glanced back to Dufresne pointedly. “I imagine the wizengamot will set someone up as acting Minister until the election has been held.”</p><p>Dufresne sighed, and slid his wand into his shoulder harness. “Wonder who it’ll be,” he muttered derisively, then promptly left the room.</p><p> </p><hr/><p><br/>That night, Hermione awoke to the smothering stillness of nighttime. Darkness pervaded her bedroom, only lit by the transient halo of the moon’s silvery light. </p><p>She quickly discovered what had awoken her. </p><p>The mattress dipped under a heavy weight, and soon hard arms encircled her. Tom’s scent flooded her nostrils, and she looked up to find two red eyes glowing in the darkness above her.</p><p>His fingers found her cheek in the blackness, stroking softly. “Hermione,” he breathed.</p><p>Hermione’s chest ached, her stomach twisting with a gut-wrenching emotion, one she couldn’t place. Her mind swam with her ominous dreams, the trap set by the DMLE, the murder of the Minister, the impending promise she’d made to Tom to reveal her secrets, and the desperation of their nightly trysts… everything crashed down upon her all at once.</p><p>“Tom,” she choked, and his arms tightened around her.</p><p>The red eyes blinked once, then twice.</p><p>“Please,” she sobbed, slipping her arms around his neck to pull him closer.</p><p>“What is it, little witch?”</p><p>“Please don’t leave me.”</p><p>There was a pause. “I won’t leave you, Hermione.”</p><p>“I’m scared.”</p><p>Another pause. He asked slowly, “Of what?”</p><p>Hermione was shaking and she didn’t know why. It was as though the past few months had caught up to her, and the gravity of her situation was finally sinking in.</p><p>Reality washed over her like a cold rain. She would perhaps never go back to her time. In all likelihood, she would live out the rest of her life in this time period, never seeing her friends again until she was in her sixties…</p><p>If she lived that long.</p><p>She looked up at Tom. The glowing red eyes had faded to black, so that she could barely see the whites of his eyes gazing back at her. </p><p>She was in love with the Dark Lord. </p><p>He was saturated with dark magic. She could feel it like a static vapor around him, its poisonous tendrils caressing her skin and teasing her own magic.</p><p>Her breathing was stilted, heart thudding heavily in her chest.</p><p>“I love you, Tom.”</p><p>There was no reply. Only a hint of a pause, and then, he kissed her. The kiss was slow and languid, his lips holding hers, tasting her mouth. For a moment, Hermione almost felt as if he were sucking her soul out, like a dementor, because she felt a deep burning in her chest, a stirring like flames licking upward in her body. It felt as though her soul were straining toward his.</p><p>Her anxiety was instantly soothed, a serene calm washing over her. </p><p>“How are you doing that?”</p><p>“I have a theory,” he whispered against her lips. “Your magic reacts to mine. I’m testing it… playing with it, if you will.”</p><p>It felt… so good. Like she’d taken an elixir, or drunk a happiness potion. </p><p>He kissed her again, and she suddenly felt hands on her. His hands. She would know his touch anywhere but yet… there were too many of them. There were hands all over her body, stroking her face, pushing her legs apart, encircling her throat, sliding her knickers down her thighs. </p><p>“Tom,” she said nervously. </p><p>“It’s only me, Hermione. Relax.”</p><p>His mouth found her breast, but suddenly there were lips all over her body. He simultaneously bit her shoulder, kissed the side of her throat, and then she felt his mouth between her legs, sucking the sensitive flesh there, his tongue slipping inside her. His teeth grazed her clit as his tongue circled against the pulsing area.</p><p>Hermione bit her lip, holding back a moan. “How are you doing that?” she asked, her voice breathless. </p><p>“Intuitively,” he muttered, his voice hoarse with hunger. His mouth never ceased its ministrations when he spoke. “I simply think of everything I’d like to do to you and my magic goes to work.”</p><p>“Do you know that you impress me, Tom?”</p><p>“You impress me as well, little witch.”</p><p>“Do I?”</p><p>“Every day.” He chuckled. “You said you would put my death eaters in Azkaban… and you bloody well did it.”</p><p>Hermione released a strangled cry as long fingers replaced his mouth, his two middle fingers sliding inside her.</p><p>“Fuck,” he breathed, pumping them in and out slowly, coating them in her wetness. </p><p>“What else impresses you?” she choked out. </p><p>Tom chuckled again. “Such a whore for praise, but I’m happy to give it.”</p><p>Hermione smiled despite the tightening of her muscles in response to his touch. “You think I’m a whore?”</p><p>“The very filthiest,” he whispered against her ear, his deep voice sending a shiver through her body. “But only for me. Sometimes I think about chaining you up and forcing you to serve my darkest fantasies.”</p><p>Hermione released a shaky breath as she writhed beneath him; he continued to touch her, fucking her roughly with his fingers. </p><p>“Why don’t you?” she asked, biting back a moan.</p><p>He made a noncommittal sound, then leaned down, tracing a wet path with his tongue between her breasts. His hair tickled her skin.</p><p>“Tom?”</p><p>He took a deep breath. “Perhaps I’ll show you that side of me when all of our secrets are out in the open.”</p><p>Hermione’s body twisted, her thighs trembling with the force of the orgasm building in her core. She let out a soft cry, unable to hold it in any longer.</p><p>Then he withdrew his fingers. She heard the ominous sound of his belt clinking, followed by the sound of his zipper. Hermione bit her lip in anticipation, her lust driving higher. </p><p>He slid his tip along her entrance, coating himself in the wetness pooling between her thighs. </p><p>“Do you want to come, darling?”</p><p>“Yes,” she rasped.</p><p>“Beg.”</p><p>“<em>Please</em>, Tom…” she choked out, twisting underneath him. “I <em>need</em> <em>you</em>.”</p><p>Her utterance gave him pause, and he stared down at her in the darkness. </p><p>A moment later, he leaned down and kissed her. As soon as his lips met hers, he filled her, driving himself deep within her as her warmth clenched around him.</p><p>Hermione arched back, breaking the kiss, giving a loud, “Oh!”</p><p>His mouth covered her breast, his tongue and teeth toying roughly with her nipple. </p><p>He moved slowly, his thrusts deep and hard, but indulgent. Hermione moaned softly, her fingertips tracing the area where the ancient markings were etched into his left pectoral. </p><p>“Tom,” she rasped hoarsely. “Oh, Merlin… <em> fuck </em>.”</p><p>She arched against him, lifting her hips, seeking to bring him deeper, but he pulled back.</p><p>“Ah, ah, ah,” he chastised. “You’ll come when I say.”</p><p>Hermione raised a brow. “Oh will I?”</p><p>She suddenly wrapped her legs around his waist and used the strength she’d recently acquired in her auror training to push him onto his side and then onto his back. Surprised, Tom allowed it. Hermione reveled in the shock painting his features in the dim light.</p><p>She straddled him, his cock still inside her as his eyes searched her face; his brows were dark over his eyes, but they sparkled with amusement. She began to ride him, her hips undulating and rocking in sensuous movements. She reached down and touched herself, her fingers finding a familiar circular pattern and following that rhythm. Her head fell back, her thick curls tumbling over her shoulders, and though with her right hand she rubbed her clit, she reached behind her and toyed with his balls with her left, running her fingers lightly around the base of his shaft.</p><p>Tom’s mouth fell open, and she bit her lip in a smug grin as she realized he was speechless.</p><p>He watched her, his eyes glittering with something akin to worship as she rode him, climbing higher and higher in her ascent to release. </p><p>“I believe you were saying something, Tom… what was it again?”</p><p>Their eyes met and she laughed playfully, but he sat up suddenly, his arm snaking around her waist and his hand pressing flat between her shoulder blades to pull her against him. She continued to rock her hips against his, taking him deep inside her, so deep she felt him in her stomach. Her breasts teased the light hair on his chest.</p><p>“Marry me,” he whispered, his eyes still locked with hers.</p><p>Every single molecule of oxygen left Hermione’s lungs on exhale as her mouth dropped open. She stopped moving, paralyzed with shock.</p><p>He reached down, gripping her hips and began to move her against him, resuming their rhythm.</p><p>“Say yes.”</p><p>Hermione shook her head in disbelief. “You didn’t… I… you don’t…” She swallowed thickly. “You don’t mean that.”</p><p>“I have never meant anything more in my life.”</p><p>“I- we-“ she stuttered, desperately failing to find words. “We have to talk about that.”</p><p>“Then we will talk about it.”</p><p>Hermione swallowed, then moaned low and deep as his fingers found her clit. He smirked as she bit her lip, feeling her walls tightening around him. </p><p>“Be my wife, Hermione.” He thrust upward, filling her to the hilt. “I want you… <em> fuck </em> , I <em> need </em> you, Hermione.”</p><p>Hermione was lost in her lust, his words causing a cocktail of shock and deep arousal to stir in the pit of her stomach. </p><p><em> Wife </em>.</p><p>It was a terrifying prospect and yet the word falling from his lips threatened to send her over the edge. Hermione’s walls tightened, pulsing around him.</p><p>She clung to his pale shoulders, burying her face against his neck as she chased release. He smelled of sweat, and spice, and smoke, and a hint of firewhiskey. She drank in his scent, intoxicated by the mixture of his magic, and his words, and the driving force of his hard length inside her.</p><p>“I would burn Britain for you,” he muttered roughly, his voice laced with passion. “I would bring the world to its knees if you asked me.”</p><p>“Could I bring you to <em> your </em> knees, Tom?” </p><p>“Only you, little witch. You could break me.”</p><p>There was something so incredibly intimate about the rawness of his words, siphoned from his lips by her thighs wrapped tightly around his hips. Confessions of a Dark Lord, conceded in the heat of passion.</p><p>He paused and she felt him stiffen within her, something he often did to keep himself from finishing before her. Hermione barely had the strength to stop moving, hungry as she was for that euphoria, the feeling of coming undone in his arms. She was addicted to being vulnerable with him, to having him this way, naked and close, being privy to his most unguarded thoughts. </p><p>Here, he was hers, his eyes and his lips, his body. She could wait no longer and she sped up, riding his cock with a fervor that seemed to shock him. </p><p><em> Husband </em>.</p><p>The word entered Hermione’s mind and once it was there, she couldn’t unthink it. She realized suddenly that in the back of her mind, she’d always expected him to tire of her, to cast her off in favor of some pureblood witch, perhaps Bellatrix, or maybe when his dreams of world domination became more tempting than his desire for her.</p><p>To marry the enemy, Hermione thought,<em> is the ultimate betrayal </em>.</p><p>Once it was done, she would never be able to go home.</p><p>“Tom,” she moaned, and his lips found hers in answer.</p><p>“Come, baby,” he whispered against her lips. “Come on my cock.”</p><p>Hermione cursed, her legs shaking as her inner walls tightened, then a burst of white light overtook her vision and she cried out. Euphoria surged through her body as Tom’s eyes roved her greedily, his hands on her waist steadily moving her up and down along his shaft. </p><p>His tongue shot out to wet his bottom lip, his onyx eyes observing the bruises blooming on the flesh of her waist beneath his fingers.</p><p>“Say yes, Hermione.”</p><p>Hermione moaned as she felt him harden. “Yes,” she sighed, half out of her mind in the moment, her walls throbbing in tandem with his cock as he shot her full of his cum, a deep groan issuing forth from his chest.</p><p>“Mine,” he rasped as he finished, thrusting a few more times before he pulled out.</p><p>Hermione was shaking. He fell back onto the bed, pulling her with him. She collapsed onto his chest, heart thundering against her ribcage.</p><p>“Tom…”</p><p>“Don’t,” he interrupted. “Don’t ruin it.”</p><p>After a moment, he summoned his wand and cast a contraception charm.</p><p>They lay entangled, heaving deep breaths in the darkness for several minutes before Hermione shut her eyes and let herself drift into oblivion…warm, blissful, and satisfied.</p><p> </p>

<h2 class="heading">All Along the Watchtower</h2>
</div>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>Hermione woke the next morning to the sound of her record player spinning. She rose to consciousness slowly, the sound of the music penetrating through the door of her bedroom. The sun streamed in through her floor-to-ceiling diamond paned windows, and Hermione sat up in bed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She wished she felt sated and at peace, but her heart was in turmoil.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was still a pending investigation, a trap laid for Tom which she was not privy to, and a hundred other obstacles that lay before them… and yet, he somehow seemed to think that they could overcome them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was either bravery or utter lunacy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione stood and walked barefoot across the hardwood floors to open the door. The music became louder as she took to the hallway and made her way through the sitting room to the kitchen. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The record player spun, playing Jimi Hendrix’s </span>
<em>
<span>All Along the Watchtower </span>
</em>
<span>throughout the flat. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She found Tom shirtless in the kitchen, brewing coffee and tea. Sitting on the counter was a pan of freshly baked scones, still warm, their smell permeating the flat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione cleared her throat and cocked a brow, and he turned, his lips curling into a smirk when he laid eyes on her. They flicked over her in quick appraisal before meeting hers with sparkling mirth and undeniable heat. “Good morning.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good morning,” she said slowly, still taking in the sight of Tom Riddle standing in her kitchen, garbed only in his trousers and a pair of black socks, a cigarette in his hand. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Since when did you learn to bake?” she asked, gesturing to the scones.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He ran his tongue over his teeth. “Since you decided to leave me, of course, without teaching me how to make them, as you promised.” He smiled and sauntered over to where she stood, sliding one hand against the small of her back as he leaned down to kiss her cheek. “I missed your scones, little witch… but I missed you more.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione didn’t know how to react. Tom was rarely this… </span>
<em>
<span>romantic</span>
</em>
<span>, particularly in the morning. She usually found him awake before her and buried in a book, or teasing her about her bed hair, or any other such sarcastic quip. He loved to wake up ahead of her and immediately research the topic they’d debated the night before, so he could refute her claims over coffee and infuriate the hell out of her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But baking her scones and saying that he missed her? </span>
</p><p>
<span>That was quite out of character for him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you feeling alright?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Quite well, darling. Come have a scone, before I eat them all and leave you none.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione narrowed her eyes and skirted around him warily, taking her seat at the table. She watched as he placed a scone and a cup of earl grey in front of her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She glared at his back as he walked away.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Strange</span>
</em>
<span> behavior.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She reached for the scone and nervously lifted it to her mouth. She held it for a moment before she sat it back down.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Tom…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He turned, looking at her and then the scone. His eyes narrowed, eyebrow cocked. “Yes?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She swallowed. “Did you poison the minister?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He snorted, then took a long drag from his cigarette. “No, my dear. It was as you said… she was allergic to alihotsy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione’s eyes flicked to the scone in front of her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom gazed at her for a moment before shock registered in his expression. “You think I poisoned your scone?!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione’s mouth fell open, and she shifted in her seat. “No, I- of course not.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom blinked several times, clearly dumbfounded. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione flicked her eyes over at him, then reached for her tea cup and took a sip. Upon swallowing, she reached for her scone, and lifted it gingerly to her mouth. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her hands were shaking.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom’s jaw tensed, and he glared at her from beneath dark brows. A moment later, he strode over to her and snatched the scone out of her hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He looked at her pointedly as he took a bite of the scone and then tossed it onto the plate.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He chewed the bite and swallowed. There was rage dripping from his face, from his eyes snapping with ire to his dark scowl. He shoved the cigarette between his lips and inhaled sharply. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you want to explain yourself?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He stared at Hermione, but she was silent. </span>
</p><p>
<span>He took another drag, then expelled the smoke violently. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“So what? My cock is good enough for you but not my scones?” He bent down, bracing a hand on the table. “Next I suppose you’ll tell me you didn’t mean what you said last night.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That got Hermione’s attention. Her head snapped up, eyes wide as saucers. “What I said? What do you mean?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He scoffed. “You said yes, Hermione.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her mouth fell open. “I- that was… I was…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He smirked. “You were what? Coming?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione’s features sharpened in frustration, but her cheeks tinted bright pink. “You’re such a manipulator.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He chuckled. “Guilty as charged. Although… I </span>
<em>
<span>did</span>
</em>
<span> say we could talk about it, did I not?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione watched him closely, then her eyes fell to the scone and she swallowed. “I’m sorry.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s a good girl.” He reached down and took the scone between his thumb and index finger and lifted it to her mouth. “Open. Now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione bit her lip, looking at him wryly before parting her lips. He presented the scone to her lips and she took a bite.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, her eyes widened. She covered her mouth with her hand as she chewed, then spoke with her mouth full, “Tom, this scone is amazing! I thought you said you couldn’t cook…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He smiled smugly, pleased at her reaction. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She ate the rest of it and then finished it off with a sip of tea and a caustic look in his direction. “How are you so bloody perfect at everything you try? It’s not fair.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He didn’t respond. He walked to the window and stared out at the garden pensively.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione watched him for a moment, feeling rather awful. It was as if she could never quite get Voldemort out of her head, and she supposed that was also the reason she had yet to divulge her secrets.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That time was steadily approaching, yet she couldn’t bring herself to imagine herself opening up to him… she wanted to, but at the same time, she was paralyzed with fear of making a grave mistake.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione stood and walked up to him, wrapping her arm around his waist. “What’s wrong, Tom?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He was quiet for a moment, blinking, running his tongue over his top teeth. “Do you want to take it back?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She flicked her eyes up to his. “What?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you wish you hadn’t said yes.” His inflection didn’t denote a question.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I-“ She couldn’t seem to form a sentence. She sighed and toyed with the strings of her robe.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He turned to her, eyes shifting to ruby red. “Is it so terrible? The thought of being married to me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, of course not. But there are other things to consider.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are there?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course.””</span>
</p><p>
<span>He waited for a beat, nostrils flaring. “Like what?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well…” She looked nervous. “I… I always imagined that the person I’d marry… that I would…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He tilted his head, then reached a hand up to cup her chin, lifting her face. “What is it, Hermione?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She avoided his gaze. “I just always imagined that I might have children one day.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>His eyebrows shot up. “</span>
<em>
<span>Oh</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She nodded, averting her eyes uneasily.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He gazed at her with intense eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You want children?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione cleared her throat. “Well.. I don’t know if I want them, but… I’d like to have the option.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He nodded slowly. “I see.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She finally looked at him. “I know you said… that you didn’t want children.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He took a deep breath. “Well… I never really thought about it, Hermione. I also said I wasn’t the marrying sort, but here we are.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione swallowed, dropping her gaze to the floor.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hermione.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She looked up and their eyes met.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I want you to be happy. And if children will make you happy, then I will give them to you. I would go to the ends of the earth to make you happy, little witch.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione sighed, then reached out and took his hand. His brows furrowed and he almost pulled back on instinct as she took his hand, as if the small gesture of intimacy was something he was unfamiliar with. “I don’t want you to do it just for me, Tom. You have to want it too… not just because you don’t want to lose me. Otherwise, it’s not fair to you… or to me. I would…” She paused, looking down. “I would want a husband who would be a present father, Tom.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He watched her for a moment as she drew circles on the inside of his palm with her fingertips. After a moment, he took a deep breath, then grabbed her hand, holding it in his larger one. “It isn’t that I’m so averse to having children, Hermione. I’m more or less concerned about disappointing you, or them. I don’t know what kind of father I would be… and I know firsthand what it feels like to have a terrible one.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione felt her hands trembling, and tears threatened to appear in her eyes but she bit them back. Because she realized that children were something she did definitely want, if possible… and as wrong as the idea seemed, she realized she wanted them with </span>
<em>
<span>Tom</span>
</em>
<span>. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Oh, how desperately she wanted a life and a family with him. She surprised herself by wanting it. Was she allowed to? Was she allowed to want it, to </span>
<em>
<span>have</span>
</em>
<span> it?</span>
</p><p>
<span>With… </span>
<em>
<span>him</span>
</em>
<span>? With Lord Voldemort, of all people?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione felt as though she were in a universe of reversals, a world completely turned upside down. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, but Tom… There's always room for mistakes. Your father wasn’t even a </span>
<em>
<span>father</span>
</em>
<span>. He didn’t even try. Those were also very different circumstances. I mean.. I’m sure you would try, at least.” She looked down at her hands. “I mean… Look how much you’ve changed as a person since we met. I don’t think that’s someone who would be a terrible father.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>In her mind, she couldn’t believe she was even considering having children with Lord Voldemort. Some errant part of her worried that she was finally off her rocker.</span>
</p><p>
<span>His Adam's apple bobbed as he swallowed, then blinked. “We can discuss it when the time comes… If it comes. But rest assured… there’s nothing I could deny you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione stepped closer, overcome by emotion suddenly, and he wrapped his arms around her tightly, pulling her into his chest. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her face was buried against his bare chest. “I’m worried about you Tom.”</span>
</p><p>
<span> She felt him tense against her. “What do you mean?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“There’s an investigation. The DMLE… they’ve set a trap for you, and I’m not privy to it. The photographs saw to that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He was quiet for a moment, then muttered, “I’m sorry.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“They hope that you’ll try to break Dolohov and Rosier out of Azkaban. Please say you won’t try.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom’s cheek muscles flexed as he stared at her. “I can’t promise that, Hermione. I have to get them out. Rosier won’t last in Azkaban much longer.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Tom, you’ll be arrested.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I won’t.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How can you be sure?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t you worry about it, little witch. I’m fully capable of handling my business.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And what is your business Tom? What are you planning?” She laughed incredulously. “You ask me to marry you but I’ve no idea how I’m going to fit into your life. Our goals are so incredibly opposite.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He cocked his jaw to the side. “I’m not asking you to fit into my life.” Silence stretched, then he took a deep breath. “I had goals, yes. I still have goals. But I intend to craft a life we both fit into… with you. I don’t need you to fit into mine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione blinked in stunned silence. Her lips parted as she gazed at Tom.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She began to realize that she’d been clinging to her fear of him as Voldemort. As long as she thought of him as the Dark Lord, someone irredeemable and reprehensible, then she could keep herself from falling for him completely. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Now, she was starting to wonder… was his madness in part contributed to the splitting of his soul seven times? The man before her was rational, reasonable… even capable of growth and of affection. In essence, Tom Riddle was nothing like the Voldemort of her time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sure, he killed the Minister for Magic… but perhaps he’d done the world a favor. Hermione certainly had no great love for her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione balked at herself. She suddenly found herself justifying murder for her depraved boyfriend like a barmy schoolgirl.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He reached down and took her hand in his, his long fingers toying with hers. “We will have a lot to talk about, won’t we? The time is steadily approaching when you will tell me everything, and I will return the favor. You have one week.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione gulped, her breathing escalating. All she could do was nod. “I know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He reached up and laid two fingers beneath her chin, tilting her face upward toward his. “I’m anxious to know what secrets lie in that beautiful, brilliant head of yours.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you really going to break them out of Azkaban?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He sighed. “I’m sorry Hermione. For your own safety I’m not going to divulge anything to you in case your auror friends decide to use legilimency on you… which would be illegal, but it’s been done before.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione reached up and touched his cheek. “I’m a skilled occlumens, Tom. Besides, I’m worried about you… not myself.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom stared at her for a long minute, his expression guarded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She felt naked beneath his gaze, as if he somehow had x-ray vision and could see entirely through her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is there a way we can get Rosier off?” he asked slowly. “I know Dolohov is fucked… for now. He’ll have to go into hiding.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>If</span>
</em>
<span> you can get him out,” she corrected.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom smirked, tilting his head. “Right. </span>
<em>
<span>If</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She gave him a disapproving look, but he merely chuckled and pulled out his pack of cigarettes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know, Tom. I can examine the evidence and see if there are loopholes.” He nodded, and she tilted her head, peering up at him. “So you’re expecting me not to tell them you’re going to attempt it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“They’re already banking on it, Hermione. Besides, your little admirer, Dufresne, won’t put you in a difficult position if I know the kind of man he is.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione’s eyebrows shot up. “You almost sound like you might admire him a bit.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s an exaggeration,” he muttered derisively. “He’s a self-righteous wanker but he’s good in a duel and I can’t fault his work ethic.” He looked her over admiringly. “Or his taste in witches.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>At that moment, Hermione’s owl arrived at the window bearing a stack of envelopes. Hermione winced as she opened the French door and the owl settled on her forearm. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What is that?” Tom asked warily. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione sighed. “My hate mail, I’m sure. Apparently I’m a sell out for my choice of romantic partner.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom watched her for a moment, his expression pensive, then he walked over to her and took the post from her hands and set it aside. He slid his arms around her. “Are we doing this?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her lips parted as she realized that they were, in fact, doing it. “I suppose we are.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But is it what you want, little witch?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She bit her lip, then nodded. “It is.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>His eyes narrowed slightly as he observed her, searching her face for a hint of hesitation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She stood on her tiptoes and pressed her lips to his. “I mean it. It is what I want… as long as you don’t kill someone or force someone into retirement that I’d rather keep around… and we should probably have tea with Dumbledore, of course.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He chuckled, then reached up and threaded his hand into her wild curls, pulling her head back slightly. He lowered his mouth to hers, kissing her slowly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After a moment, he broke away and muttered against her lips, “Deal, darling.”</span>
</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>“Come along, Piksy!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione’s kitten heels clacked along the pavement leading up to the old factory. She wore a rather elegant set of robes, black and quilted, with a high neck and gilded accoutrements, the sleeves long and trailing as the robes whirled around her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione had never really cared for the color black, but in this season it had become her favorite. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She wondered if that was telling.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Piksy hopped along beside her, practically bouncing in a brand new cerulean blue dress. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione flicked her wand, opening the creaking double doors with their fogged glass. She found her way down the hallways and to the left, to the factory’s office. It was her day off and she had a very important meeting scheduled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A bellowing laugh met her when she entered the office. A long, oval table sat in the midst of the office, and around it, sat a grouping of her very favorite people: Brutus Quintus, Delores Diggle, Tobias and Winnie Haywood, Septimus and Cedrella Weasley, Eulessia Baron, Fleamont and Euphemia Potter, her lawyer, Starling Sylvanox, Professor Slughorn, her financial advisor, and a team of magical architects. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Brutus stood and crossed the room with a brilliant smile, extending his hand to shake Hermione’s with a beaming look. “Well, look who it is! Our very own writer </span>
<em>
<span>slash</span>
</em>
<span> auror </span>
<em>
<span>slash</span>
</em>
<span> entrepreneur… what’ll it be next, Miss Dumbledore… Minister?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione’s eyes widened, lips parting. She glanced over the room full of people, then swallowed thickly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Brutus cleared his throat. “Do forgive me, perhaps that was in bad taste, considering the recency of the Minister’s passing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Hermione murmured, laying a hand on his shoulder. “I understand your intent perfectly. I appreciate the compliment, but as you can see, there’s quite enough on my plate already!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione took her seat at the head of the table. Piksy hopped onto its surface and presented her with a large scroll, which contained an exhaustive list of the orders of business which had yet to be addressed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione started at the top, with the financial allowances for each department. She discussed with Slughorn, the Potters, and Miss Haywood the necessary budget for potion-making equipment and stores of ingredients. She delegated to Winnie the purchasing power for new cauldrons and the various necessities to get the factory up and running.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The next order of business was the restoration of the factory itself. Her team of magical architects quoted her a number for the budget, which her financial advisor marked in his notes, and a time frame for making the needed repairs. Hermione discussed with Delores Diggle the security measures for protecting the factory. A security plan was set and put in place, delegated to Delores for execution.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, Hermione broached the subject of the Chronomancer. Eulessia Baron was appointed Editor-in-Chief, and tasked with hiring columnists. Hermione picked Eulessia’s brain, and they settled on the purchase of a new printing press which would be magically enchanted with duplication charms for faster distribution. The factory’s blueprint was examined and a part of the factory was sectioned off as an owlery for the paper.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione had already discussed with Piksy a sort of coup. Piksy and Lucky would approach the elves who were tethered to the House Elf Placement agency and determine which elves wanted to be freed. Then Hermione would buy their freedom and hire them for the Chronomancer. They desperately needed workers to keep up the factory and to take care of the owls, which Piksy had suggested were perfect entry level jobs for newly freed elves.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Cedrella Weasley was hired for the Chronomancer, and she, in turn, planned to hire her own house elf to take care of little Bilius during the day. Septimus had also left his unsavory job at the Ministry in favor of being the factory’s overseer. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Potters, taking a strong personal interest in Winnie Haywood’s blossoming career, went in with Hermione as investors. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When all orders of business had been addressed, action had been taken, and finances allotted, Piksy and Lucky snapped their fingers and a marvelous spread of food appeared on the table. In the center was Cedrella Weasley’s famous hotpot, which she had cooked and brought in under a stasis charm. There was celebratory laughter and the clinking of glasses as Slughorn popped open a bottle of a dark, vintage elf-made wine.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They all dug in and feasted until they were quite stuffed, then scattered and meandered about the factory, chit-chatting about the future.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione was gazing up at the magnificent arching beams of the factory’s rafters when Slughorn caught up with her. He held up his glass and Hermione chuckled, then clinked hers to his and they both took a sip. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Congratulations, Miss Dumbledore, on your immense achievements. To have accomplished so much in only the span of a year is a remarkable feat, even for the most ambitious witches and wizards. You certainly are a prize of our society. It’s really too bad you weren’t ever a Hogwarts student - I would have </span>
<em>
<span>loved</span>
</em>
<span> to have had you attend one of my dinners!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione rubbed her lips together, fighting to hide a smile as her old professor flattered and fawned over her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>He gazed at her with a twinkle in his eyes, and leaned in conspiratorially. “Of course, I had absolutely </span>
<em>
<span>no idea</span>
</em>
<span> you were the witch Tom Riddle had told me about! Imagine my surprise to see the two of you make the papers together this past week.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione’s brows drew forward. “I beg your pardon?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He chuckled. “Don’t be so modest, Miss Dumbledore! I won’t tell a soul about the potion, although I will say it is quite the academic anomaly and I’ve been absolutely eager to share the news, even to study the case if you two would one day permit. It is such a rare occurrence, after all.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione’s eyes narrowed a fraction. “Oh right… the potion. How silly of me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Now, now, you’ve got a lot on your mind, my dear. But, I will say, it’s not something you would easily forget, that’s for certain.” He laughed genially to himself. “Of course, if you ever complete the bond, I would very much like to study the outcome. According to scholars, and all recorded cases, really… your magic should be positively tripled in power!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione was frozen, rooted to the spot. Her mouth went dry, and she swallowed thickly. “The bond, you say?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He looked at her funny. “Why, yes, of course. The soulmate bond!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She ran her tongue over her teeth, her blood beginning to boil. “Right. Of course.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>At that moment, they were interrupted by the entrance of Winnie Haywood. Hermione could barely see straight, she was so angry. A soulmate bond? Was that why he had called her his soulmate?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Why hadn’t he told her? What potion was Slughorn referring to, and how was it possible to complete a soulmate bond?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Madame Violette’s words resounded in her ears.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione felt herself growing very cold, numbness spreading across her skin in waves. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Their magic would be tripled, Slughorn had said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Suddenly, it all made sense.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Of course</span>
</em>
<span> Tom would want to triple his magical strength.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She grit her teeth, her heart racing with anger, thudding violently in her chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The bastard wanted to triple his power, then use all of her knowledge of the future to spin things in his favor.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione stood, absolutely stunned by her own stupidity.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She wasn’t given time to process her thoughts, as Winnie begged a moment alone with Hermione. Slughorn excused himself and Hermione turned her attention to the petite blonde witch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How are you, Miss Haywood?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Something seemed off about the girl today. She looked tired, as if she hadn’t slept in days.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m quite well, Miss Dumbledore.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione forced a smile, shoving her anger to the furthermost part of her mind. “Please, call me Hermione.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you, Hermione. I’m so pleased to be working with you. Well, if I’m being honest, it’s a dream come true that you would put faith in me. I could never have hoped for something like this without your help. I’ll do my best to make this factory a roaring success, so that you don’t regret taking a chance on me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione smiled and reached out for the young witch’s hand. She realized with some shock that Winnie wasn’t much younger than herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione supposed the war had aged her quite a bit; she felt very old, in a lot of ways.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Winnie… may I call you Winnie?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The witch nodded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I had a feeling about you from the moment we met at the ball. I absolutely believe we’ll be a powerful team, and I can’t wait to see your new potion brews in action, when they are out of the testing phase.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Winnie’s eyes lit up for a moment, but her smile faltered quickly, the sparkle in her gaze dulling to a sadness.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione cocked her head as she gazed at the girl. “Forgive me, but you seem a bit out of sorts today. Is there something plaguing you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Winnie’s eyes lifted slowly to meet Hermione’s gaze, and instantly tears welled up along her waterline. She blinked and they spilled over. “Oh, I’m so embarrassed. I told myself I wouldn’t bring it up to you…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione’s eyebrows knit together. “But of course you should say something Winnie… whatever is the matter?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Winnie’s hands shook as she wiped at the tears staining her pale cheeks. “It’s just that I know you work for the DMLE… and I should not even be asking you, and I’m sure you can’t tell me anything about the investigation but… can you tell me, is Edward alright?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione cocked her head in confusion. “Edward? Edward Rosier?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Winifred nodded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione’s mouth fell open. “Well… I- I haven’t seen him, actually, since the day of the arrest.” Her eyes roved Winnie’s face in an attempt to understand her distress. “Is he a friend of yours?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Winnie’s eyes widened and her lip parted. She stuttered and stammered around her words, seemingly unable to voice the reason for her discomfiture. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione’s eyebrows rose as realization dawned. “It’s alright, Winnie, I see now.” She rubbed her lips together. “What could I do?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Winnie shook her head dismally. “I understand that it's his own fault. He got himself into this mess and-“ She swallowed. “I’ve told him time and again this would happen. I’ve been afraid for him for so long, Hermione.” She met Hermione’s gaze. “I fear for him in Azkaban.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione watched her gravely. After a moment, she spoke. “I do think there’s a possibility that he might be let off by the Wizengamot. He’s only guilty by association, and with his family ties…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She trailed off, and Winnie nodded, understanding Hermione’s meaning. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not exactly on the case anymore, Winifred. Not since… well, since the papers.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Winnie’s eyes widened. “So it’s true then? You and Tom Riddle?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione bit her lip. She wasn’t so sure, after all, since this most recent revelation. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She sighed. “It’s complicated.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Winifred chuckled wryly, shaking her head as she dried her tears. “I certainly understand that… all too well.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione laughed and shook her head as well, wondering how two bright witches like themselves had somehow gotten wrapped up with wizards such as these.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Winnie, I will do what I can. There’s a good possibility that he could go free… I don’t know how much control I’ll have in the matter, but I can try.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can you just… could you see if he’s alright? They won’t let me see him. Something about an expected escape attempt.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione took her hand. “I’ll see what I can do.”</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>There was a reason Hermione had worn black.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Torrents of rain fell in sheets like a monsoon, flooding the perfectly tended landscape of the Tuft Estate. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Thunder rumbled like the very voice of Zeus, falling like a landslide from the sky. Hermione looked up to catch a glimpse of a sinister flash of lightning which illuminated the anthracite sky.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione gripped Dumbledore’s arm tightly. A thin membrane of magic surrounded them like a dome, shielding them from the downpour.  It shimmered as the drops plunked against it. Hermione and Albus made their way down a stone path, through gardens with hedges on all sides, toward the Tuft Mausoleum. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Finally, Hermione caught sight of an immense crowd of people. The mood was somber, and due to the blur of the rain, Hermione could barely make out the faces of those standing in a circle around the massive stone monument. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The crowd parted as Hermione and Albus approached, she garbed in black robes, and Albus  in silver-gray. Hundreds of eyes watched the two of them as they took a place near the front of the crypt, where Hermione’s gaze met Gaspard’s. She felt a pang of regret, only for a moment, before she began to search the crowd for another set of eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Stygian fire. The instant his eyes met hers, Hermione felt branded with heat, despite the cold April rain. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom stood on the other side of the stone path, among Tuft’s advisors. Aeris Flint stood beside him, and Abraxas Malfoy on his other side. His lips parted, eyes narrowing as he gazed back at her. Then, a quick flick of his eyes downward in an appraisal, a look that spoke of possession. When his eyes met hers again, there was no mistaking the message within them. Hermione almost thought she heard his voice in her head.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>You’re mine. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>It startled her, but she thought she must be imagining it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her mind instantly replayed Slughorn’s words from that morning.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Confusion washed over Hermione, and she quickly looked away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione spotted Tuft’s husband, a rather attractive wizard with dark, charcoal hair and silver streaks. He wore a yellow rose in the breast of his robes, which was known to be Minister Tuft’s favorite. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Beside him was a boy whom Hermione presumed was their son, Ignatius. He seemed to have gotten the best looks from both, as he was a striking young man with Tuft’s brilliant blue eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He appeared sullen and unhappy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione almost felt a bit of remorse. Anger coursed through her, and she thought for a brief moment that it would serve Tom right if she turned him in for the murder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Why couldn’t she do it?</span>
</p><p>
<span>She knew why.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She looked back to him, to find his eyes already on her. They were searching, questioning. Perhaps he’d caught onto her dishumor. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione looked away. </span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a sound of flapping, and the crowd looked up to see the approach of two thestrals, drawing behind them a kind of funeral pyre. They flew with their great leathery wings, descending from the skies.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They didn’t prance like horses, only moving forward somberly, their skin stretched thinly over their skeletal frames. Hermione instantly knew who among the crowd could not see them. Their eyes searched the air, wide, fearful. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione’s eyes met Tom’s once more.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I love you</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She heard his voice again echoing in her mind, and this time she was sure she had not imagined it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In case she was capable of sending a thought back, she thought very pointedly, </span>
<em>
<span>Stay out of my head.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>His lips twitched. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione’s brows furrowed.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>That’s new,</span>
</em>
<span> she thought fearfully. </span>
<em>
<span>How can we do that?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>How has he gotten in my head?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Dumbledore leaned in closer and Hermione turned her head to hear.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The tension between the two of you is quite palpable, daughter… and you’re gripping my arm so tightly that I daresay it’s going to go numb.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione’s lips parted, and she turned her wide eyes to Albus to find his blue eyes laughing, resting on her with barely discernible crinkles in their corners. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione rubbed her lips together, fighting back a smile. “Who will be minister now, Albus?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>His eyes bore into hers, one eyebrow cocked, and he inclined his head as if to say, “I suppose we will see, won’t we?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione blinked her gaze away as the thestrals passed by them and led the pyre bearing Tuft’s body to the stone circle before the Mausoleum. The crowd shifted, lining its edge.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Minister Leonard Spencer-Moon took to a magical platform which had appeared, and began to give a speech. One by one, ministry officials and even Malfoy Senior gave their accounts of their relationships with Tuft, outlining her achievements, the Tuft family legacy, sharing little anecdotes. Vicencia Santos was markedly absent, which to Hermione, spoke volumes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Hermione listened, she had the faintest feeling that she was being watched. After a moment, she flicked her eyes over at Tom, who’s eyes also slid to the side to meet hers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She felt a hand grip her throat, and she audibly gasped.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Albus turned his head to the side, but Hermione shook her head slightly, squeezing his arm.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>There he stands,</span>
</em>
<span> Hermione thought, wondering if he could hear. </span>
<em>
<span>A murderer honoring his victim like any good sociopath would</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione didn’t really believe her own thoughts. It was past that for her now. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Because she loved him. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Because she would probably never again see her own time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Even if she could go back… would it be the same?</span>
</p><p>
<span>She doubted it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She also doubted whether she would go back now, if given the choice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She swallowed as the vast crypt opened, and the thestrals disappeared into its darkness bearing Tuft’s corpse.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Whether she liked it or not, she was tied to the Dark Lord.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They belonged to each other.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>You’ve got some explaining to do, </span>
</em>
<span>she thought pointedly, attempting with all of her might to send the thought his way. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>So have you, darling.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>The thought slipped into her mind with smoothness, like a caress.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione marveled that the sound of his voice could cause her to lust, even at her enemy’s funeral. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Yes, he had changed, but she had, too.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Perhaps, Hermione had gone about changing the future the wrong way.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Perhaps, in order to change the future, she only had to change </span>
<em>
<span>him</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I love you</span>
</em>
<span>, his voice whispered. </span>
<em>
<span>You’re angry. I can feel it. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Yes, she was angry.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But his presence had dulled her anger somehow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione watched as Tuft’s body was swallowed by the darkness.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It felt good to see her disappear forever, and Hermione was somewhat ashamed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The tomb doors closed with a resounding finality, the heavy sound dissolving into a peal of thunder from overhead.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Gone was the girl who wouldn’t use Unforgivables on Death Eaters… who refused to murder, the girl who fought for the light, harboring impossible standards and ideals.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The world was much more complex than that, Hermione had learned. She suddenly understood Albus more than she ever had.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She took a deep breath. </span>
<em>
<span>Well, Hermione, </span>
</em>
<span>she thought to herself, </span>
<em>
<span>welcome to the club of those who do what must be done regardless of ethics. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Fucking a Dark Lord certainly would be frowned upon by her peers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She suddenly realized she cared very little for the moral high ground.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione wasn’t the hero… but she wasn’t the villain either.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was just doing her best.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Perhaps that’s all anyone could do, really.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She tilted her head and looked at her hand resting on Albus’ arm, her index finger bearing the ring he’d given her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Perhaps, Albus had only ever done his best as well.</span>
</p><p>
<span>If the day came when Hermione would have to turn on Tom for the good of the world, she would do so, as Albus had once done. She could at least be as brave as he had been when he fought Grindelwald.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She hoped such a day would never come.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She laid her head on Albus’ shoulder. </span>
<em>
<span>How lonely he must have been, </span>
</em>
<span>she thought.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I love you, Albus,” she whispered softly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He laid his hand over hers and gave a gentle squeeze.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The heavy rain obscured the rivulets of tears staining her cheeks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her gaze met Tom’s, and his dark eyes swallowed her whole, like the shadowy darkness of the crypt.</span>
</p>

<h2 class="heading">Rings &amp; Rallies</h2>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>Tom’s heart was racing as his eyes flew wide open. His body was tense, frozen in the aftermath of a dream which felt too real. His eyes glowed ruby red as his chest rose and fell with heavy breaths. </span>
</p><p>
<span>After a moment, he realized where he was, but he couldn’t shake the surrealness he felt, as if nothing around him really existed. It was a strange feeling as he glanced about himself in the dark, still tethered to the dream plane he’d been in during his sleep. He sat up in bed, running his hand over his face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hermione?” he called softly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But no. She wasn’t there. </span>
</p><p>
<span>He hadn’t seen her for three days. Not since the funeral.</span>
</p><p>
<span>His contacts at the ministry kept him up to date on her activities and whereabouts, so he hadn’t been too worried about her safety until now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But then…</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom’s mind drifted back to the dream.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Hermione’s screams filled his ears, reaching him from somewhere in the distance. Tom’s feet wouldn’t move; he was stuck where he stood. Before him was a mirror framed by a serpent eating its own tail… and in the mirror, when Tom peered into its darkness, a face appeared.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Not his face, but that of another man, one who seemed vaguely familiar to Tom. His hair was dark and chin-length, his skin a deep olive tone, and his eyes were red… as red as Tom’s own. He had a prominent, leonine nose and a long face, with a strong, defined jawline. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>The man’s lip was curled into a snarl.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Tom’s brows drew forward sharply as he stared back at the man. He then cocked his head and to his surprise, the man in the mirror also cocked his head, mirroring his movements.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Tom somehow knew, whether through his powers of legilimency or through that kind of knowing that one possesses in dreams through partaking of the spirit world, that he knew this man.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Hermione screamed again, somewhere in the distance. He’d had the same dream multiple times recently, but he could never get to her, never find her in the dream plane he was in.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Suddenly, the man jerked forward and grabbed Tom by the collar, pulling him into the mirror with him. When Tom crossed the threshold, the man was no longer handsome and dark skinned, but pale like a vampire, with snakelike eyes and mere slits for nostrils. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Give it back,” he hissed to Tom.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Give what back?” Tom spat in reply.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>The creature’s red eyes darkened, turning black. “You know what you took. Give it back.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Tom had awoken from the dream at that moment. He had half a mind to visit a seer, one gifted with interpreting dreams.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dreams and prophetic utterances had always plagued Tom. He feared them because they seemed to come from some source unknown, something beyond. </span>
</p><p>
<span>At least magic was something Tom could wield, could study. But the seer realm was something outside of Tom’s control, proof of that which he had always hoped to avoid by evading death.</span>
</p><p>
<span>With a growl of frustration he swung his legs over the edge of the bed and stood, taking his wand from the night table. The lamps lit magically as he waved it, then walked across the creaky floors to his magical hiding place. He drew a line with his wand in the air, opening the pocket in space where his diary was hidden. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Reaching inside the opening, he withdrew a tiny box. He popped open the lid. On a bed of black velvet lay a delicately wrought ring. A serpent, its scales dusted with diamonds, wound itself around a large, faceted emerald. The snake formed an ouroboros, the same as the mirror in his dream.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The ouroboros was an ancient symbol, predating modern wizardry, tracing its roots back to Egyptian sorcery and Greek mythology, namely made famous by popular alchemists. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom had been fascinated with the theme since he’d studied Egyptian sorcery, having noticed the motif when perusing the </span>
<em>
<span>Enigmatic Book of the Netherworld</span>
</em>
<span>, an ancient Egyptian funerary text discovered in the tomb of Tutankhamun, which was opened a few years before Tom’s birth. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Confederation had had a field day trying to neutralize that situation, with the amount of magical objects that were discovered in the tomb by muggles. They’d sent a wizard by the name of Howard Carter, an expert on Egyptian magic, to the excavation site to confiscate any dangerous objects before they fell into the hands of muggles. He was protected by a magical ring, called the Ring of Ra, so that the curses placed on the tomb wouldn’t affect him. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Confederation obliviated countless muggles, placing memory charms on their minds, which caused them to believe Carter had indeed discovered the tomb himself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Of course, it was a momentous discovery in the magical world, and several of the texts were translated and duplicated for public consumption. Enchanted objects were placed in the Egyptian Museum of Magic under protective spells. Tom had studied the objects found in the tomb extensively and read every tome available, being highly fascinated by the complex spells of ancient egypt. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The ouroboros depicted the journey of Ra to the underworld and his union with Osiris, resulting in his rebirth as Ra-Osiris. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Something about the tale spoke to Tom, the themes of union, death, rebirth, and eternity. In truth, Tom felt as if he’d died the moment his lips first touched Hermione’s. There was something larger than life about their union, and he suspected that somehow, they’d known one another in a previous life.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“My beautiful goddess,” he whispered, fingering the emerald. “Now that I’ve found you, I’m going to keep you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He would chain her to himself with this ring, and he  would chain himself to hers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For the first time in Tom’s life, he wanted to be tied down.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He thought of his plans prior to meeting Hermione. He’d planned to leave Britain as soon as he collected the objects he needed for his horcruxes… to go to Albania and find the diadem, to seek out dark wizards who seemed to only exist in fables and whispers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When he returned, Tom Riddle was to be no more.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He would return as Lord Voldemort. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom ran his thumb over the diamond-encrusted serpent. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Change of plans</span>
</em>
<span>, he thought derisively. </span>
<em>
<span>For now</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He slipped the box back into his hiding place and began to undress, then made his way to the bathroom and turned on the shower.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom’s heart thumped in his chest as he waited for the water to warm. It had been quite some time since he’d felt anxiety like this. It almost made him afraid… his body filled with dread, but he didn’t know why.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tonight was an important night, after all, and he needed to prepare. Even the most powerful wizards had to plan and execute those plans properly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He lit a cigarette and then stood, naked, beneath the spray, allowing its pelting heat to relax his tight muscles.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He sucked the smoke deeply into his lungs and exhaled around the cigarette. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Tonight’s the night,” he muttered, the cigarette still hanging out of his mouth.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Hermione busied herself for three days with auror training, and in turn, she was tasked with training the Hit Wizards’ new recruits once a week. Hermione was sent out to check on anonymous tips and since she was rather good at investigating and extracting information, she was given the menial task of following up on leads.</p><p>
<span>She was kept from all meetings pertaining to the investigation. Hermione began to feel rather alone, like a great divide began to stretch between her and her co-workers, many of them caught giving her sidelong glances and questioning stares throughout the day.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They wondered if Tom Riddle really did orchestrate the breaches, and if so, was Hermione covering for him?</span>
</p><p>
<span>She couldn’t fault them. Their wonderings weren’t far off base.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She also knew that if it were any other member of the squad, they would be expected to cast aside all personal loyalties in favor of doing their job with integrity and a lack of bias.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Gaspard did it to protect Hermione, so she supposed she should be grateful.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Dumbledore!” came Gaspard’s deep, booming voice from the doorway.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione stood and crossed to meet him at the entrance to his office, then followed him inside.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He sat at his desk and looked at her, his lips parted for a moment before he gestured for her to sit. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They sat in silence for a brief time before Hermione spoke. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is there any new information about Minister Tuft’s death?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Gaspard flicked his eyes to hers. She read suspicion in them, but they cleared right away. “It seems it was an unfortunate accident. The minister was allergic to alihotsy fudge.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione’s eyebrows lifted. “I see.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“May I ask you something, Hermione?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Their eyes met. She felt the coolness of his wash over her. “Of course.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you recall how Minister Tuft died in your time?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione swallowed, her heart already speeding. “Yes. I do.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is this how she died?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She blinked a few times. “Actually, yes… but it was a bit further in the future. Still during her administration, though, I believe.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Gaspard rubbed his chin thoughtfully. “You think not to divulge these things in order to preserve the timeline?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione nodded slowly, being cautious with her answer. “Yes. Any small change could cause big consequences. Then, there’s also the fact that I’m not supposed to be here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Gaspard nodded. “Right. Of course.” He took a deep breath. “You said she passed several years in the future. If you being here is the only difference in the timeline, how can you explain her untimely death?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione didn’t freeze. She didn’t grow fearful. She looked back at him calmly, suddenly giving herself over to lies and deceit for the purpose of protecting Tom. A strong possessiveness washed over her, forbidding her from being truthful. She felt much like the serpent in the garden, the lies just rolling off her tongue as easily as they did from Tom’s. “I don’t know, Gaspard. That certainly is a mystery. Have they learned anything more in the investigation?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Gaspard’s blue eyes narrowed slightly, penetrating her own. She continued to occlude, keeping the truth hidden behind her mental walls, locked up tight. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It seems that the fudge was sent by a…” Gaspard cleared his throat. “It is a delicate situation. I’m trying to rule out all possibilities before I inform her family… namely, her husband. But it appears the fudge was sent to her by a lover. Or at least that’s how it’s been made to appear.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh,” Hermione muttered, shock registering on her face. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“So,” he continued, “if that’s the case… what exactly would your presence in the timeline have changed?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione’s lips parted. “What are you insinuating, Gaspard?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He pressed his tongue into his cheek. “Hermione…I’m not insinuating anything. But I do think there’s something you know that you aren’t telling me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You told me you wouldn’t ask questions relating to my knowledge of the future.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He exhaled sharply. “This is becoming very difficult, Miss Dumbledore.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So now I’m </span>
<em>
<span>Miss Dumbledore</span>
</em>
<span>?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He took a deep breath, then twisted his lips to the side to bite his cheek. A moment passed in silence before he spoke. “I think, given the circumstances, that I should refer to you as I do the rest of my aurors. I crossed boundaries with you that I should not have, in a moment of weakness… but seeing as how that’s past and behind us, and someone else clearly has your affection… for my own sake, I’d like to keep things professional.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And you think asking me leading questions is professional?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Gaspard leaned forward suddenly, his blue eyes sharp as a blade. “I’ve stepped quite far out of line for you. On Dumbledore’s word and on my own intuition have I kept your secret safe from the Ministry.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So you’re blackmailing me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Merlin’s beard!” Gaspard sat back, exasperated, pressing the heels of his palms into his eyes. After a moment, he dropped his hands, the muscles in his jaw tensing and untensing. “I have a lot of pressure on me due to recent… </span>
<em>
<span>events</span>
</em>
<span>. Events that I suspect are your boyfriend’s doing. I like to think, despite my wounded pride, that we are friends, Dumbledore. I’m doing my best to keep you out of it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione gazed back at him, feeling terribly sad. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Were she not on her current path, she would have probably fallen hard for Gaspard.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But the fates had other plans for her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well,” she began slowly, “I wasn’t really going to divulge this, but seeing as how the circumstances </span>
<em>
<span>are</span>
</em>
<span> questionable…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Gaspard cocked his head, listening.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Minister Tuft came onto Tom some months ago.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He blinked several times. “You mean…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes. She was very clear about what she wanted.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Gaspard’s eyebrows furrowed. “Go on.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well… it appears that he informed her that he already…” She shifted in her seat uncomfortably. “That he already had a witch.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You,” Gaspard interjected.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione paused, then nodded. “She was a bit put out I believe, but nonetheless. I think if he and I weren’t… </span>
<em>
<span>involved…</span>
</em>
<span> he may have perhaps considered it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Gaspard ran his thumb over his bottom lip as he contemplated. “Riddle is, or rather, </span>
<em>
<span>was</span>
</em>
<span> her political protegè.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione snorted. “I think it’s now obvious that wasn’t all she was hoping for.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Gaspard took a deep breath, then leaned back in his seat. “What you’re telling me is that, were you not in the picture, he might have… become sexually involved with Minister Tuft.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione rolled her eyes. “Yes, that’s what I’m saying.” </span>
<em>
<span>He wouldn’t dare. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“And you’re saying that since he didn’t… she may have chosen to become involved with someone else.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione nodded. “Yes, Mr. Dufresne… and </span>
<em>
<span>that</span>
</em>
<span> person-“</span>
</p><p>
<span>“-sent her the fudge.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione nodded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Gaspard sat back. “We tracked the owl who sent it. It belonged to her young assistant, Efren.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione swallowed. “It seems as if… as if it was just merely an accident.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Gaspard peered at her, his blue eyes faraway. “Yes. That’s what it appears to be, in any case.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione breathed an internal sigh of relief. “Is there anything else you need from me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ah, yes there is, actually.” He stood, taking a scroll from his desk and tucking it under his shoulder. “I’ve got to go and see a representative about the Dolohov &amp; Rosier trials. Our best aurors have been put on surveillance at Azkaban around the clock so we don’t have many bodies to spare, but there’s a press event at Carkitt Market today that requires auror security. You and Rabnott will go down to make sure things stay in hand.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He waved his wand, securely warding his office as she followed him out. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Minister Tuft was supposed to hold the briefing and make a speech, but I suppose they’ll have one of her cabinet do it. You shouldn’t have any trouble.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He reached out and shook her hand before exiting through the door of the auror department.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione smiled wryly as Andrew Rabnott handed over her outer robes and they made their way toward the elevator.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p><br/>
Carkitt Market was full of witches and wizards hoping to hear news of the Minister’s passing. The masses still had no knowledge of the circumstances revolving around her death, and there was a sense of unrest and paranoia. There were whispers and muttering about who would take her place. </p><p>
<span>Hermione watched the crowd gather in the outdoor structure, beneath the market’s Victorian style overhead architecture. The press event was already underway when they arrived, with a representative from Minister Tuft’s cabinet answering questions with predetermined statements.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I cannot answer questions relating to the investigation at this time, but I guarantee that a statement by the Department of Magical Law Enforcement is forthcoming in the next forty-eight hours,” said a squat man named Marius Merrythought into the enchanted microphone. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“When will the trials of Maximilian Dolohov and Edward Rosier take place?” shouted a reporter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The trial date has not yet been set,” Merrythought responded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do we know yet who is behind the breaches?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The Department of Magical Law Enforcement is working hard day and night to uncover the suspects behind these destructive activities-“ Merrythought couldn’t finish as he was flooded with a barrage of questions. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are these two men part of the dark wizard gang? And are these activities linked to the framing of Cyrus Pilloughby and the break-ins at the Historical Society of Magic?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Have the families issued a statement?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“There are members of the Rosier family seated on the Wizengamot. Will this be a fair trial?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The questions escalated, growing out of hand, with voices rising louder. At that moment, Hermione and Andrew walked forward slowly, silently taking their places at opposite sides of the crowd. Their brilliant crimson auror robes were trimmed in gold and black, along with the dragon-hide boots which laced up their calves, cobbled from onyx and flame-red Peruvian Vipertooth scales. Their golden badges gleamed in the sunlight as the crowd began to settle down immediately, taking in the sight of the dark wizard catchers. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione stood to the side, hood drawn up, but her presence was a tangible balm, sating the crowd’s unrest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The remainder of the press conference passed with civility, but the crowd was still uneasy. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Now, I would like to introduce our speaker, a wizard who was quite close with the late Minister Tuft, a man of such accomplishment and immense magical skill that our Wilhelmina chose him as her personal protegè. Who better to give this speech on her behalf than such a wizard? Allow me to introduce Tom Riddle!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The crowd broke into applause.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione’s mouth fell open, but she quickly recovered when she noticed the glances from the crowd that were being directed her way.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>What is your game, Tom?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Tom walked forward from his station near a group of officials lingering at the base of the platform. He climbed the steps, his gait sure and smooth. Hermione’s breath caught as she admired his form, the way his lustrous black hair was slicked back handsomely, his white shirt crisply contrasted with his black tie and robes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When he looked out over the crowd, his eyes instantly caught on Hermione. Then, in a blink, they moved on, surfing over the mass of people.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Greetings, my friends, and may I offer my condolences for the loss you have suffered this past week… in fact, the loss we have </span>
<em>
<span>all</span>
</em>
<span> suffered.”</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>The loss you caused</span>
</em>
<span>, Hermione thought. She almost shivered at the thought. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Minister Tuft was a strong and proud witch, who represented wizarding Britain well, despite her shortcomings. Who could have anticipated this unfortunate and dangerous series of breaches?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The crowd murmured, looking at one another. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom flashed a charming smile. “Well, I could. While I respect and honor Minister Tuft, I cannot applaud the grave mishandling of these events. I was told to address these failures in a way that will soothe the ache that our beloved Minister has left in her wake. However, I do not feel that I can do so with a clear conscience. My duty is to wizardkind, and bearing that in mind, I feel that I must speak candidly to you all, as you deserve. We are in a crucial time in magical Britain’s history, and we face a very real threat in this hour. Even now, the International Confederation of Wizards can no longer stem the threat that is being posed to our kind. Nearly sixty-eight percent of the Ministry’s funding is allotted to keeping the Statute of Secrecy intact. Breaches are becoming even more numerous now, so much so that the Confederation can hardly keep up. We have a wizarding prison which is unfit to hold dangerous criminals. Our own judicial system has innocent wizards and witches being convicted of crimes, such as Cyrus Pilloughby, and Maximilian Dolohov, and Edward Rosier…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Heads turned and the crowd murmured loudly at the mention of his death eaters’ names.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Our children’s educational curriculum is severely lacking, particularly in the area of Defense Against the Dark Arts and wandless magic. Not only that… but the education of muggleborns and our methods of integrating them into our society are sorely lacking.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There were more whispers. Hermione’s eyes widened.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>What was his game?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>What did he care for muggleborns?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“I believe that there is a time upon us where we must question the efficacy of the Statute of Secrecy. An effective solution will be years in the making, and will require close cooperation with muggle leaders worldwide. Previous dark wizards have attempted to bring down the Statute, and their methods were infantile and their notions misguided. I have developed a plan to usher wizardkind into a brighter future… to address the policies and systems which are now in place, but unfortunately are ineffective. Our outdated laws and ideals must be reviewed and updated to reflect our modern society.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The crowd was held in rapt attention. Hermione could see it on their faces. It wasn’t so much his words that seduced them, but the charisma of the wizard himself. Tom Riddle had a magnetism that was otherworldly and ethereal. Hermione even felt herself being pulled into his allure.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Therefore, I will take this opportunity now to announce my candidacy for Minister for Magic.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The crowd gasped and shifted. The market filled with the sound of whispers and murmurings. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom’s eyes fell on Hermione, and his lips twitched.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“There will be another rally in Diagon Alley in ten days time. I will see you all there.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He flashed them all a brilliant smile, and the crowd went wild with applause, shocking Hermione. She glanced about her, stunned at the ease with which he had charmed the crowd. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom made his way back down the stairs, met by a group of aghast ministry officials.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione was still standing rooted in shock when she was approached by another witch. When she looked to see who it was, she was met by her friend, Eulessia Baron.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fancy seeing you here, Hermione.” Her friend smiled, garbed in brilliant ruby robes with a smearing of cherry red lipstick over her full lips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione broke out of her stupor to hug her friend. “You look lovely, Lessi.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I just came from the DMLE, but you weren’t there. Collecting statements for the first issue of the </span>
<em>
<span>Chronomancer</span>
</em>
<span>.” She kept her voice low. “I came for the press event, but I definitely didn’t expect this. Did you know? Aren’t you two-“</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I didn’t know,” Hermione muttered, perturbed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Eulessia’s eyes widened and she rubbed her lips together to hide a smile. “Should we report on this?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You are the editor-in-chief, Lessi. You have to do as you see fit.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione watched Tom leave the market through a side door, his head bent low as another ministry official whispered in his ear. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione swallowed. She should be angry with him, and she knew there were many things to discuss between the two of them, but she couldn’t help the overwhelming desire to see him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She missed his touch, and the way his eyes consumed her. She missed leaning back against his chest as he smoked and she read books.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Three days seemed an eternity, but she couldn’t very well apparate into his flat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She had a meeting with Winnie, to sign off on several purchase orders.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then she had an evening tea set with Dumbledore.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The first edition of the Chronomancer will be delivered by owl post all over London this Sunday, Hermione. Are you excited?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione smiled widely, taking her friend’s hand. “Oh, very! I’m so very proud of you, friend. And grateful for you as well.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Eulessia beamed, her light brown skin glowing in the spring sunlight. “Well, I’d better go, I’ve lots to do before the launch. Shall we have lunch next week? We have a </span>
<em>
<span>lot</span>
</em>
<span> to catch up on.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione nodded. “That would be divine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Perfect.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione watched her friend apparate away, then readied herself for the rest of the day’s meetings.</span>

<p> </p><p>After work later that day, Hermione stopped by Portsmouth Potions to check in on the construction and renovations that were currently underway. A lovely little hand-painted sign was hung up on one side of the factory in whimsical, curling letters, <em> The Chronomancer. <br/>
</em></p><p align="center">
<em> <img src="https://i.ibb.co/jGBWyqS/01-C13493-0-A63-46-F9-B61-B-A8-A94-F635213.png" alt /> </em>
</p><p>She toured the potions lab and the newly designed storage rooms, then she and Winnie Haywood examined the recently acquired equipment. </p><p>As Hermione was admiring the brand-new brass cauldrons, Winnie spoke. </p><p>“Hermione, please know how much this all means to me. I don’t know how I can convey the depth of my gratitude in words, but… just know that to see this all coming to fruition is a dream come true for me.”</p><p>Hermione smiled at her new friend. “Winnie, I’ve heard nothing but wonderful things about you and your family. Professor Slughorn highly recommends you and praises your potioneering genius. I never was much good at potions myself, although I did try. Of course, I can brew any potion you ask and do it correctly the <em> technical </em> way… but <em> you </em> have a gift. A natural aptitude.” It saddened Hermione as she thought of her old potions professor. Professor Snape had possessed a natural aptitude, much the same as Winnie. “I’m happy to be able to partner with you Winifred, and the scholar in me is thrilled to see what kind of formulas you’ll develop! Perhaps we could even consult some of the famed alchemists my father is acquainted with. I’m sure they might have some valuable input.”</p><p>Winnie’s eyes widened into saucers. “Do you really think so? Like who?”</p><p>“Well… I know my father is good friends with Simon Magnus, a distant relative of Albertus Magnus, and then of course there’s Nicolas Flamel-“</p><p>“Nicolas Flamel? Merlin!” Winnie pressed a hand to her chest, gawking at Hermione.</p><p>“You know of him?”</p><p><em> “Know of him </em> ? My parents practically <em> worshipped </em> him! I’ve heard rumors that he’s still alive but I had no idea you <em> knew </em> him.”</p><p>Hermione winced. “Well, I don’t exactly know him. But my father does.”</p><p>Winnie’s eyes sparkled. “I wonder if there’s any way we could get a copy of his <em> Livre des figures hiéroglyphiques!” </em></p><p>Hermione tapped her fingertips to her chin. “I can certainly look into it. I’m quite curious to learn more about the process of transmutation myself..”</p><p>“I read a bit in Sir Isaac Newton’s journals, the Cadeuces, the<em> Dragons of Flamel </em>! He has such fascinating hypotheses about the magical knowledge housed in the Temple of Solomon. His writings on the warlocks of Atlantis and the magical genetics of mermaids are quite compelling. I’ve always thought that if we could combine muggle research of chemical compounds with the proper spellwork, we could probably stumble upon some discoveries that wizards have never seen before!”</p><p>Hermione stared at her, aghast. “You’re extremely well-studied, Miss Haywood. We should compare notes, as I’ve always had quite the interest in Newton’s alchemical theories.”</p><p>Winifred lit up like a star, and Hermione found that she very much enjoyed her company. It had been a while since she’d had someone to discuss academics with, and it made her all that much more painfully aware of Tom’s absence.</p><p>She suddenly longed to see him and wondered why he’d made no effort to see her the past few days.</p><p>“By the way, Winnie… I did look into the matter that we discussed before. It seems that the DMLE doesn’t actually have any solid evidence on your Edward. No spellwork was found when aurors performed <em> Prior Incantato </em>. At the present time, he’s only guilty by association. It’s possible that with the proper defense, he could go free.”</p><p>Winnie was quiet as she organized a tray of vials. After a few moments, she sighed. “I shouldn’t be as loyal as I am, but… I suppose it’s just my nature. I can’t help it.”</p><p>Hermione refrained from inquiring further. If anyone understood complex romantic entanglements, it was herself.</p><p>“I’m positive it was Riddle who put him up to it.” Winnie’s eyes flicked to Hermione. “Are you… is he-“</p><p>“Yes,” Hermione breathed. She wandered the room aimlessly. “I’m afraid he’s going to try to get them out.”</p><p>Winnie did a double take, her eyes widening in that signature way of hers. She crossed the room, making her way over to Hermione as she laid a hand on her shoulder. “You mean break them out of Azkaban?”</p><p>Hermione averted her eyes. “Don’t say anything.”</p><p>“But… won’t that make things worse? Won’t it make them look more guilty? Add time to their sentences?”</p><p>Hermione sighed. “I don’t know. I don’t know what his plan is. It… I’m concerned.”</p><p>“I should think so.”</p><p>Hermione took a deep breath, then plastered an insincere smile on her face in a show of bravado that she didn’t feel. “I will keep my eyes and ears open, Winnie. If there’s anything I can do, I will do my best to help him.”</p><p>“Thank you, Hermione. I don’t know what I did to deserve a friend like you.”</p><p>Hermione smiled weakly and gave her hand a squeeze.</p><p>Just then, the tip of her vinewood wand began to glow, signifying the time. </p><p>“Oh, dear, I’ve got to be going. I have tea with my father.”</p><p>“Enjoy,” Winnie smiled. “I’ll be here for the rest of the week. I’ve been eating, sleeping, and breathing this potions lab.”</p><p>Hermione quickly signed off on the remaining purchase orders, bid her farewell, and disapparated.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Hermione’s chest heaved, entirely out of breath as she slid her wand into her thigh holster. Her “tea” with Dumbledore had turned into a training session, in which Albus insisted on teaching her the finer points of duelling with elemental magic.</p><p>They found themselves back in his rooms in the teacher’s wing afterward, and it was beginning to get rather late. Hermione had half a mind to just curl up right in his armchair in front of the fireplace and go to sleep.</p><p>Dumbledore approached, bearing a cup of tea which he handed to her. </p><p>“Thank you, Albus,” she muttered quietly.</p><p>“How are you, my dear?”</p><p>Hermione took a deep breath. “Busy. Tired. Confused. Hopeful. Anxious. All of the above, and then some.”</p><p>Albus gazed into the fire, but his lips twitched. “Welcome to the life of the powerful and influential, Hermione. Those feelings will likely never go away.”</p><p>“Marvelous,” she said wryly, giving him a small smile. “How are you, Albus?”</p><p>He took a sip of his peach brandy. “I’ve managed to stay much the same as I’ve always been, however, I am concerned for you.”</p><p>Hermione lowered her tea to her lap. “How so?”</p><p>“You are seeing Riddle now, is that right?”</p><p>Hermione paused for a moment, then nodded her head. “I suppose I am… although I haven’t seen him for a few days.”</p><p>“Is it not suitable for us to all have a meeting?”</p><p>“I… think that would be wise. I’ve spoken with him about it. He’s agreed.”</p><p>“Good,” he muttered, his voice soft. She could read the tension in the lines of his face, a distinct energy of unrest.</p><p>Hermione took a sip of tea, then murmured, “You’re not comfortable with our relationship?”</p><p>Albus turned to her, his eyebrows raised and forehead slightly wrinkled.</p><p>“No,” he said after consideration. “But that does not mean that I will not support you in whatever way that I can. I will trust you to make the right decisions.”</p><p>Hermione looked down at the cup in her hands. “He’s… well, I’m not so deluded as to think he’s good, per sè, but… he has changed quite a lot since we met.”</p><p>“And you love him?”</p><p>She looked up, her brown eyes meeting his blue. “Yes. Very much.”</p><p>His lips turned up into a sad smile. “It is a beautiful thing to be in love, Hermione. Whether it lasts for eternity, or only for a brief while.”</p><p>Silence stretched between them, too sacred a moment for Hermione to want to interrupt. She left him to his musings and memories for several minutes before she spoke again.</p><p>“He’s announced his run for Minister.”</p><p>One of Albus’ eyebrows quirked. “So he has. Interesting.”</p><p>“Who do you think will be the next minister?”</p><p>Albus stroked his salt-peppered auburn beard. His thick, waving hair was combed back and streaked with gray, his robes a dark ochre, trimmed with gold embroidery. Hermione fought back a smile, her heart warming to the older wizard, whose presence was sometimes so unassuming that one almost failed to remember that he was quite lethal. He hummed. “I think you should run.”</p><p>Hermione stopped, her mouth slightly ajar. “Is that just because you don’t want Tom to win?”</p><p>“No, my dear. It is because I think you would doubtless make a magnificent Minister for Magic.”</p><p>“I’ve invested a lot of time in my auror training, Father.”</p><p>He paused, absorbing the sound of the title falling from her lips.</p><p>“So you have… and now you have a deep understanding of that department, and how it works. Something that any good Minister should know.”</p><p>“I <em> also </em> have a newspaper to run, a factory to oversee. I’m on the board of Midas Bank. I have friends and social engagements to keep up with… studying to do. Training with you, which is no small commitment. Not to mention, I have a dark lord to babysit…”</p><p>Albus began laughing under his breath at her words, at first stifling it with his hand over his mouth, but soon enough, he was shaking with hearty laughter.</p><p>Hermione finally cracked and began chuckling herself. </p><p>“Hermione dearest,” Albus interjected, his lips twitching and eyes sparkling behind his spectacles, “if you want to institute change, then do so. It is as simple as that. Run for minister. You will do a great deal of good.” Albus winked at her. “Show him up.” He leaned toward her, his blue eyes gleaming ethereally in the firelight. “<em> Beat </em> him.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Hermione arrived back at her flat late that night. She ate a quick bite and collapsed into bed, overcome by exhaustion. She waved her wand, dimming the lights until they went out, then tucked it under her pillow.</p><p>She lay in the darkness of her room, wondering where he was and what he was doing.</p><p>Was he sleeping?</p><p>Was he plotting? Reading?</p><p>His voice rang in her ears, the fatal knife thrust into her heart as he spoke <em> I love you </em> into her mind at Tuft’s funeral.</p><p>Hermione’s lips parted, releasing a rush of breath as she felt a familiar ache between her legs.</p><p>“I miss you,” she whispered to the empty night.</p><p>Finally, frustrated that sleep would not come, she opened the drawer beside her bed and took out a vial of Dreamless Sleep potion, and tipped it back.</p><p>Soon, everything blurred, and a darkness blacker than night descended, drowning her in its shadowy embrace.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>He couldn’t find them.</p><p>Tom’s soul was hovering above Azkaban prison, dodging dementor after dementor as he searched each part of the fortress.</p><p>Rain torrented down and lightning lit the sky, but it merely fell right through him. Foreboding thunder rumbled as dementors circled him menacingly.</p><p>With each lightning strike, the shadowy wraiths appeared closer. Their closeness felt like an encounter with death. </p><p>Tom had always felt nothing in the presence of Azkaban’s guards. He’d truthfully never seen what the fuss was all about.</p><p>That reality had almost made him question himself. Was he really so different from the general populace?</p><p>But now he felt it, the icy tendrils of dread curling around his heart… the chill in the air, the shortness of breath, the distant crawling of his skin.</p><p>He had no time to question why they were suddenly affecting him so viscerally.</p><p>He shot down in a nosedive toward the prison, evading the hungry cloaked figures as they drifted closer.</p><p>Rosier had been kept for several days in the maximum security cells of the east block of the prison, on the third level, but he’d clearly been moved. </p><p>Moved every few days, Tom suspected, to foil any escape attempts.</p><p>He’d hoped to avoid the dementors’ notice by astral projecting. They’d never paid him much notice before, but it seemed that his soul being bare and unprotected was having the opposite effect.</p><p><em> No matter </em>, he thought. He would locate his death eaters and extract them quickly. </p><p>Tom threw his magic out like a thousand tiny sensors, searching for Rosier’s magical signatures.</p><p>It was possible they were separated. That would make things more difficult because he’d unfortunately made a pact to retrieve Dolohov as well.</p><p>Tom rounded the prison, sensing with his magic, searching, feeling. The dementors were ever at his back, watching him, trailing along behind him like a pack of devilish hounds.</p><p>He didn’t have time to wonder why.</p><p>The wind roared and thunder cracked. Rain fell in sheets, obscuring anything beyond the length of his arm. Had Tom been flying on a broomstick, or even with his powers of unsupported flight, he would’ve had a difficult time seeing in the darkness.</p><p>Fortunately, his preternatural sight was much keener than his physical eyes. </p><p>As he combed the levels, allowing his instincts to guide him along the minuscule rows of windows carved into the stone, he began to sense a familiarity, a kind of warmth emanating from one side of the towering structure. He shot up down to where he felt it and peered into the barred window.</p><p>It was dark inside the cell, and with the roar and din outside, Tom could hardly determine whether it was where Rosier was being kept.</p><p>Suddenly, Tom felt a deathly cold wrap itself around him. He watched the stone exterior of the prison begin to ice over, frost creeping along its walls with sinister slowness.</p><p>Tom whirled around to find himself face to face with an enormous dementor, its lifeless jaws opening like the maw of the Grim Reaper.</p><p>In the distance, Tom heard Hermione scream; the sound penetrated him to the bone, gripping his heart in torment.</p><p>Tom promptly sunk through the walls of the prison, evading the dementor’s deathlike grip as he fell into the dank cell.</p><p>He heard the shrill cry of the dementor as it raged beyond the thick stone wall.</p><p>Tom clutched at his chest, unfamiliar with the heaviness of the dementor’s presence, a hollow despondency that pierced his soul. </p><p>Tom had been in the presence of dementors many times and never experienced this.</p><p>He listened, but there were no screams. Hermione couldn’t be here, there was absolutely no way.</p><p>At that moment, Tom saw him. His death eater was curled up in the corner of the cell, asleep. Lightning struck, providing Tom with a clear sight of his dark curls and tattered clothing… the same he’d been wearing when he was arrested. </p><p>Tom closed his eyes and began to summon all manner of dark energy to himself. </p><p>Here in this prison, there was much of that to be had.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<em> Hermione ran through the halls of Gryffindor tower. Thunder cracked violently, causing Hermione’s heart to leap into her throat.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> The storm outside was dangerously close.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> She paused by the open window and gazed out at the Black Lake. It churned in turbulent rebellion, the wind dancing along its sweeping swells and whipping at its waves. The sky was black, so black that the mountains bled into the firmament, the stars hiding themselves behind the storm clouds. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Fear prodded Hermione forward, and she took off running, but what she was running from, she had no idea. </em>
</p><p>
<em> As she ran down the staircase past the hospital wing, sounds began to reach her. At first, they were distant, but they gradually became clearer. The whoosh of spells being cast, the shouting of incantations… the clanging of battle. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Hermione’s heart pounded violently, adrenaline coursing through her veins as her repressed fears became reality. </em>
</p><p>
<em> She found herself back in the thick of the battle. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Hermione felt something cold in her hand. She looked down to find her fingers clutching tightly to Hufflepuff’s cup.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Get to the chamber, she thought. </em>
</p><p>
<em> She took off running. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Padding through corridor after corridor, she passed scores of frightened students and professors. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Vaguely, somewhere in the back of her mind, she realized that to destroy the cup would kill Tom. </em>
</p><p>
<em> But her fear propelled her, driving her forward, trapping her in a replaying memory. </em>
</p><p>
<em> The entrance to the girl’s bathroom loomed before her and she entered, already breathless. </em>
</p><p>
<em> She spoke the only word she knew of Parseltongue, doing her best to mimic its serpentine cadence. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Open,” she commanded. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “I didn’t know you could speak parseltongue. You’ll have to explain that one to me, little witch.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> Hermione whirled around to find Tom standing behind her.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Tom,” she sighed with relief. “How did you get here?” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “I’m always here. Now… how do you know parseltongue?” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “I-“ </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Because, if I recall correctly, only an heir of Slytherin can speak it, and that would unfortunately make us kin, and I’d sincerely hate to discover I’ve been fucking a relative.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> Hermione would have laughed if her heart wasn’t gripped with fear. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “It’s a long story, Tom.” She looked down at the cup. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Tom’s eyes followed her line of sight. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “My cup,” he murmured. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “I…” She blinked, turning the cup over in her hands. “I have to destroy it.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> His eyes flicked to hers. “You want to destroy me?” </em>
</p><p>
<em> She shook her head, brows furrowed in confusion. “No… I don’t want to destroy you… I want to save you.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> His black eyes met hers, penetrating her soul. “Then save me, little witch.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> He pulled her into his arms, and he kissed her. Hermione melted when his lips met hers, so warm and familiar, the shape of them almost seeming sculpted just for hers. </em>
</p><p>
<em> She sighed, her fear seeming to subside for a moment. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Tom’s mouth moved gently against hers, soothing her, bathing her in his dark, but comforting magic. His tongue slid against her teeth, a silent request. She answered him, opening her mouth wider to allow him to kiss her more deeply. His tongue darted expertly into her mouth, teasing hers. Hermione sighed and leaned against him, her terror forgotten. </em>
</p><p>
<em> All at once, laughter began to echo in the the room, a hoarse, sinister sound. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Hermione broke free from her trance just in time to see a tall wraith of a man enter the room, his skin pale as moonlight, black robes trailing along behind him.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Hermione looked into a pair of blood red eyes that sparkled with laughter. </em>
</p><p>
<em>“Get back, Hermione,” Tom commanded, pushing her behind him and drawing his wand.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She was in a daze as she looked between the two of them.</em>
</p><p>
<em>They stood at opposite ends of the room, Tom Riddle and Lord Voldemort.</em>
</p><p>
<em>As he gazed at Tom with narrowed eyes, his thin lips curled into a dangerous leer. Then, laughter bubbled up from his chest like poisonous fumes, reverberating in the hollow bath chamber.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Before Hermione knew what was happening, Voldemort had drawn his wand, the elder wand, and in one sharp movement, he cast the killing curse at Tom.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Avada kedavra!”</em>
</p><p>
<em>Stunned, Hermione watched Tom’s body fall to the floor.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She stood for a moment, disbelieving, processing what took place before her, before her scream suddenly pierced the air.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Hermione fell to her knees at Tom’s side, Lord Voldemort’s presence all but forgotten.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She touched his face and his hands. She pried open his eyes.. she shoved him, jerking him up off the floor by his robes.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“No, no, no !” She screamed.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She muttered incoherent things, her hands fluttering over him in a panicked frenzy.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Tom, Tom, baby, answer me.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>Her heart had stopped beating, freezing over at the sight of his eyes staring unblinkingly through space. </em>
</p><p>
<em>“Tom,” she breathed feverishly, her ears closing up to any sound, darkness blinding her peripheral vision. “Don’t do this.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>An arctic cold washed over her skin, her blood like ice flowing through her veins… the frigid sensation of fear.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Tom!” she screamed, her hysteria heightening.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Ah, ah, ah,” came a voice from behind her.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Suddenly, she found herself jerked away from his body. She was pinned to a wall, everything becoming a blur as she watched, eyes wide in terror as Lord Voldemort bent over Tom’s body.</em>
</p><p>
<em>His hood was lifted over his pale, venous head. She could only make out the ruby-colored eyes gazing down at Tom.</em>
</p><p>
<em>For a moment, she thought he might kiss him.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Then, a dreadful realization hit her.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Voldemort was sucking the very soul from his body.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“No!” she screamed, her voice cracked and strained.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She could see it, Tom’s soul, a shimmering black substance being vacuumed from his body.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She felt a pain in her chest, like a knife was being driven into its cavity and ripped asunder. She gasped at its sharpness, the sensation of her heart being cut out.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Tom!”</em>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p><br/>
Hermione jumped in her bed, sitting up straight as she clutched at her chest. She gasped for breath, the dull pain still tearing at her chest. It took a moment for her to get her bearings, disoriented as she was.</p><p>Hermione stood, sweat pouring from her body, needing to feel the floor beneath her feet, needing something to ground her after the terror of her dream.</p><p>“Wait,” she whispered, still shivering violently. Her eyes flicked to the empty vial of potion on her night table. </p><p>She’d taken Dreamless Sleep.</p><p>Her every muscle stilled, her breath halted as she thought back to the dream…</p><p>But… it was no dream.<em> It couldn’t be </em>.</p><p>How could she dream under the influence of the potion?</p><p>“Something’s wrong,” she whispered, pressing into the vague sense of disquiet that was slowly settling over her. </p><p>Her brows furrowed, and she lifted her palm to her chest to feel the rapid thudding of her heart.</p><p>Something was seriously wrong.</p><p>She could <em> sense </em> it.</p><p>Thunder cracked, shaking her crystal lamp and causing the wood floors to vibrate. Lightning streaked across the sky, illuminating for a moment the torrential downpower just beyond her windows. </p><p>With feelings of unrest rising, Hermione grabbed her wand and crossed her room in the darkness.</p><p>“Lumos,” she muttered, using the bright tip of her wand to search her desk for the parchment.</p><p>She found it beneath a stack of scrolls. She unfurled it and uncorked her ink, then dipped her quill and penned a quick message. </p><p>
<em> Tom, are you awake? </em>
</p><p>She set her quill down and waited. </p><p>She paced.</p><p>Minutes later, after she’d grown impatient with waiting, she went into the kitchen to make tea.</p><p>When she returned, the note went unanswered.</p><p>Hermione swallowed as she stared at it.</p><p>Her skin crawled with paranoia.</p><p><em> No matter </em> , she thought. <em> I can probably still apparate to his flat. </em></p><p>She decided she could go and check on him without waking him. She hadn’t braved his flat in months, but seeing as how they were technically an item now, she didn’t see the harm in it. </p><p>If she was discreet, he wouldn’t even know.</p><p>She quickly threw on her clothing and turned on her heel, disapparating with a soft click.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Hermione appeared in Tom’s living room to the sound of bangs and muffled voices.</p><p>It took her a moment to acclimate as she looked around herself, taking in the sight of his sitting room. Nothing had changed, though the sounds were coming from the hallway.</p><p>Someone was banging on the door.</p><p>“Is this the private residence of Mr. Tom M. Riddle?” asked the voice of a man behind the door. “The alarm at Azkaban prison has been activated and as such, we have a warrant to search your premises.”</p><p>Hermione’s eyes widened and terror gripped her heart with its cold, skeletal hands.</p><p>She didn’t waste a moment. Adrenaline shot through her veins as she took off running for his bedroom. </p><p>She skidded to a halt when she crossed the threshold.</p><p>There, in the center of the bed they’d so often shared, lay Tom Riddle, though completely unconscious. The room was dark, but dimly lit by the glowing red of runes etched by wand into the wood floor.</p><p>Protective runes. Hermione recognized most of them immediately. </p><p>The banging grew louder and more insistent, accompanied by more voices, now shouting.</p><p>Hermione didn’t have time to figure out what was happening. She immediately began to dismantle the runes, knowing that she wouldn’t be able to reach him until they'd been disarmed.</p><p>It took longer than she’d hoped, as his magic was strong. Hermione, thankfully, was very knowledgeable about protective enchantments due to her time on the run. She’d had months and months to study and practice her spellwork.</p><p>Suddenly she heard the sound of the front door opening. Her heart jumped into her throat.</p><p>The voices became clearer. </p><p>She recognized the voice of her co-worker, Andrew Rabnott.</p><p>There was no time to finish dismantling the enchantments. Hermione thought quickly on her feet, ripping the beaded bag from her wrist. She engorged it and summoned Harry’s invisibility cloak, then threw it over Tom’s body. </p><p>She ran to the loo and turned on the shower, then emerged to cast concealment charms over the remaining runes just as the bedroom door was opening.</p><p>She inhaled slowly, attempting to slow her heavy breathing.</p><p>Rabnott entered the room, wand raised. He cast lumos, then he stopped dead in his tracks when he saw Hermione standing there in her nightgown.</p><p>Shock registered on his face. </p><p>“Miss Dumbledore?”</p><p>Hermione squinted in the bright light from his wand. “Andrew?” she asked, doing her best to feign surprise. “What are you doing here?”</p><p>His mouth fell slightly ajar. “I- what are you doing here?”</p><p>She glanced about, biting her lip in chagrin. “Well…”</p><p>“Of course,” he muttered, clearing his throat in embarrassment. “Forgive me, ahh… is Tom Riddle here?”</p><p>Her eyebrows shot up. “<em> Oh… </em> he’s in the shower.”</p><p>Andrew’s eyebrows furrowed. “Are you sure?”</p><p>Hermione fought back laughter. “Well, <em> yes </em>, I just saw him go in a moment ago.”</p><p>Andrew’s eyes flicked to the bathroom, then back to Hermione. All was quiet save the sound of the shower water running.</p><p>“I have to ensure that he is, in fact, here.”</p><p>Hermione’s eyebrows rose. “Well, you’re welcome to go and have a peek, but you might get an eyeful.”</p><p>Andrew’s lips twitched. </p><p>“Why are you looking for Tom, Andrew? Has something happened?”</p><p>His eyes met hers, then slid away to wander the room. “No, nothing to concern yourself about, Miss Dumbledore.”</p><p>“Then why are you here?”</p><p>“I have to be sure he’s here and not elsewhere under polyjuice.”</p><p>Hermione’s eyebrows furrowed. “I should think that would be rather awkward, if the man in the shower is someone else under polyjuice.”</p><p>“Why is that?”</p><p>Hermione blinked several times, then crossed her arms and looked around herself, a wry smile painting her face.</p><p>Realization dawned on the auror’s features. “Ah… forgive me, Miss Dumbledore. I suppose if you could present me with Mr. Riddle’s wand, that would be sufficient evidence, but I’d need you to make sure he’s at the precinct in the morning.”</p><p>Hermione turned, glancing about the room to the nightstand where she knew Tom kept his wand. It was just beyond the circle of protective runes.</p><p>She swallowed, then held out her hand. </p><p>To her relief, she was able to summon it.</p><p>Her eyes met Andrew’s as she handed it over.</p><p>Andrew looked it over, then gave her a curt nod. “He can retrieve it in the morning when he comes in for questioning.” He turned to leave, but paused. “We will search the rest of the flat, if that’s alright.”</p><p>Hermione nodded. “But… we will probably go to sleep when he’s done in the shower. It’s been a long day.”</p><p>His eyes cut to the bathroom door again, then back to Hermione. He gave her a quick nod, then left, closing the bedroom door behind him. </p><p>Hermione released her breath with a choked sob, then fell to her knees. She breathed slowly, trying to regulate her heartbeat for several moments, then stood went to turn the water off. When she emerged, she continued to work on the runes.</p><p>Once she had them dismantled, she checked to see if the coast was clear. The hit wizards had appeared to have left, so she went back into the bedroom, removed the cloak, and checked Tom’s pulse.</p><p>Her brows knit in confusion as she gazed at his unconscious face. His skin was warm.</p><p>Suddenly, she recalled something he’d said to her at the giant’s pub, about astral projection.</p><p>“What are you doing, Tom?” she asked in frustration.</p><p>Rather than leave his body to be discovered in another raid, she took his hand and apparated them to her flat. She left him lying on the floor of her living room while she dressed.</p><p>The faint feeling of disquiet had grown stronger, until she was practically hyperventilating with anxiety.</p><p>“Something is wrong,” she whispered as she threw on her auror robes.</p><p>Andrew had said the alarm at Azkaban had been activated.</p><p>She knew that she wasn’t welcome as part of the investigation, but if Tom was in danger, there was no way that she could stay away.</p><p>She wasn’t sure what was causing it, but her gut was telling her there was trouble.</p><p>She gazed down at Tom as he lay lifeless on the floor. She clenched her teeth in frustration, recalling that she had warned him against an attempt to breach the prison again.</p><p>“We will have to work on your ego,” she muttered bitterly. </p><p>Then she apparated away.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Hermione gasped as she appeared on the rocky island to a torrential downpour. She was instantly soaked, the wind and rain whipping at her face in copious amounts. The waves of the black ocean around her rose and fell, churning violently with the force of the storm.</p><p><em> Of course, he wouldn’t choose to do this in normal weather, </em> she thought. <em> That would be too simple. </em></p><p>Poseidon himself seemed to be angry. Hermione scrambled back from the shore, escaping just in time as a wave crashed and fell where she’d been standing.</p><p>She lifted her wand and cast a rain repelling charm, but it did little good to help her see, the heavy deluge like a curtain before her, obscuring her vision.</p><p>She could just barely see the blur of the prison lights in the distance.</p><p>Hermione didn’t waste a moment. She ran up the rocky hill toward the prison. As she neared, she began to hear the prison sirens blaring eerily.</p><p>Her heart nearly stopped, but she trudged forward. </p><p>She approached the window where the wardens slept.</p><p>“Open up!” she screamed above the din. “Open the prison doors, I’m an auror!”</p><p>A few moments later, the window slid open. A set of eyes peered at her. “All the aurors are inside.”</p><p>“They’ve called me in for reinforcements,” Hermione huffed. “Open the doors.”</p><p>“I’m under strict orders not to let anyone else in the prison, under threat of arrest.”</p><p>Hermione held her auror badge up to the window. “You have to let me in.” Her frustration began to mount.</p><p><em> Tom, what are you doing? </em> she questioned silently.</p><p>“I see that you’re an auror, but there’s funny things happening lately. Could be forged. Can’t let you in, Dufresne’s orders.”</p><p>Hermione’s mouth hung open as she gawked at the witch. Finally, her mouth snapped shut, and she gave the witch a tight smile. </p><p>The storm roared around them.</p><p>“If you can have Dufresne come and fetch you, I can let you in. But I’ll bet they’re preoccupied inside. They’re hunting someone.”</p><p>Hermione swallowed.</p><p>There was no other choice left for her.</p><p>“Imperio,” she whispered below the roar of the waves. </p><p>The witch’s eyes suddenly became unfocused, appearing glazed and faraway.</p><p>“Let me in, please,” Hermione asked politely. </p><p>“Oh, sure, sure,” the woman nodded genially. The door finally opened.</p><p>“Hurry your arse,” Hermione muttered impatiently. </p><p>“I’m going, I’m going,” the woman chuckled.</p><p>She led Hermione through the rain to the entrance of the prison. The sirens screamed above them, and Hermione could hear a clamor of pandemonium coming from the various levels of the prison.</p><p>“Oh, dear, what was the spell?” the witch muttered.</p><p>“You’ve got to be kidding me!” Hermione exclaimed in frustration. “Hurry up!”</p><p>She waved her wand, casting a memory boost charm. </p><p>“Ah!” laughed the witch. “I do recall it now.”</p><p>“<em> Wonderful </em>,” Hermione murmured derisively.</p><p>She seemed to be dismantling a series of complex enchantments, before the series of locks on the heavy iron door clicked open.</p><p>As soon as the door swung open, Hermione dashed through the opening and down the dark corridor.</p><p>“Wait!” called the witch. “You don’t know your way!”</p><p>Hermione ignored her. She lit her way with her wand, speeding past a chorus of shouts which rang out from the prisoners as she finally reached the first cell block. </p><p>She ignored the comments and jibes from the prisoners as they reached out their hands to try to grab hold of her. The hallway was more narrow than she would have liked, but she sped along on a mission, evading their grasp.</p><p><em> I should have seen ten dementors by now </em>, she thought nervously. </p><p>That didn’t bode well. She could feel the icy dread in the air, the atmosphere of hopelessness that seemed to penetrate her very bones in this prison.</p><p>She couldn’t imagine staying here for longer than a few hours. No wonder people went mad here.</p><p>It made her even more determined to build a new prison.</p><p>She climbed the first flight of stairs that wrapped around the east end of the prison. Her way was lit by the dim flames of torches. </p><p>The second floor was much quieter, with only a few prisoners shouting as she followed the labyrinth of corridors through the cell block. </p><p>Hermione began to feel a pulling in the center of her chest. She didn’t have time to question it; she merely followed it, praying to the gods that it would lead her to Tom.</p><p>During her auror training, she was required to study and be tested on the prison’s blueprints, wards, and enchantments, in case there were ever a mass breakout. She followed the blueprint in her mind, systematically running through the maze until she reached a place where the second stairwell should’ve been.</p><p>“Thank Merlin,” she breathed as she came upon the set of stairs. But just as she began to climb the first step, a large, shadowy figure appeared in front of her, issuing forth a guttural sound from beneath its hood.</p><p>Hermione suddenly lost all will to move as the dark figure swooped down upon her.</p><p>“No,” she groaned, dodging the dementor’s skeletal grasp. “I’m an auror, step aside!”</p><p>But the wraith refused to move. It bore down upon her, until she was forced to conjure a patronus. </p><p>She thought of her parents, safe and secure in Australia. She thought of the life they must be living in the sunny outback. A silvery light burst forth from her wand, pushing back the dementor and casting it back against the stone wall. </p><p>Hermione didn’t turn around. She merely plunged forward, taking the steps two at a time as she climbed to the third floor.</p><p>She descended flight after flight of stairs, letting the tugging in her chest guide her. When she reached the fifth floor, she finally heard the sounds of her fellow aurors. Jack McLaggen’s voice boomed through the hallways, shouting orders.</p><p>“Check every cell!” he boomed. “Dufresne and Bones will go up to level six.”</p><p>Hermione’s heart beat swiftly, but she willed herself to stay calm.</p><p><em> Where are you? </em> she thought anxiously. <em> Tom, where are you? </em></p><p>She avoided the fifth floor, dodging past the voices as she sped up to the sixth floor. </p><p>She decided to avoid running into her boss on that level, being lured up to the seventh floor by the pulling sensation in her chest. </p><p>She could feel herself getting closer to Tom.</p><p>If he was astral projecting, how would she even recognize him?</p><p>How could he get his death eaters out of Azkaban without his physical body?</p><p>Hermione’s mind raced with possibilities.</p><p>The door at the top of the stairwell was locked, so she cast a spell to unlock it silently, then pushed the heavy iron door open with a creak.</p><p><em> Hermione</em>.</p><p>She stopped dead in her tracks.</p><p>It was Tom’s voice, very faint.</p><p>
<em> Are you here, or am I mad? </em>
</p><p>She sucked in a deep breath as she attempted to respond to the voice in her mind.</p><p><em> I’m coming</em>, she thought. <em> I’m in the prison. </em></p><p>There was no answer.</p><p>She swallowed thickly and stepped into the hallway. </p><p>
<em> Where are you? </em>
</p><p>No answer.</p><p>Her heart pounded violently, so much so that her entire body shook. She made her way down the corridor, breathing much heavier, even gasping for breath as the air was thick with dread. </p><p>She peeked around a corner, then rounded it until a strong arm wrapped itself around her throat, hauling her backward.</p><p>For a moment, she was relieved, thinking it was Tom. But then she realized he was bodiless, and the scent that stung her nostrils was foreign.</p><p>“Well, well, well,” came a strangely familiar voice. “Imagine catching an auror unaware.”</p><p>Hermione thrashed against the man’s hold. “Let me go!”</p><p>The man chuckled in a deep tenor, his chest rumbling against her back. “You’re going to get me out of here.”</p><p>Of a sudden, Hermione placed his voice. It belonged to Dolohov. She recognized his voice from the first time he'd accosted her at the first Ostara Ball.</p><p>“You certainly do love to sneak up on unsuspecting witches, don’t you, Maximilian?” she gritted through her teeth.</p><p>“Perhaps you should be more observant,” he muttered, tightening his hold on her throat.</p><p>“Where is Tom?” she gasped.</p><p>“I don’t know, you little <em> whore </em>,” he snapped. “He told me to wait here and he ran off, but the aurors are here now, and there will be dementors soon enough. You’re getting me out of here.”</p><p>“You would leave Tom behind?”</p><p>“He can take care of himself. Now, let’s go.”</p><p>Hermione gripped his forearm as he dragged her along before him, but she wasn’t going to be Dolohov’s hostage. She aimed her wand at his feet and shot a tripping jinx, and when he stumbled, she conjured a knife and sliced his forearm, forcing him to let her go. </p><p>She spun around and quickly cast <em> immobilis </em>, freezing him where he stood. Then, she took off running back down the corridor, her dragonhide boots padding heavily along the stone floor. The storm raged outside the windows, wind howling as sheets of rain blew in through the open windows. She could only imagine how wet and cold these dank cells were in the winter time, and she was reminded of Sirius and the twelve years he’d been trapped within these hellish walls.</p><p><em> Where are you? </em>she pleaded.</p><p>Hermione ran through the maze of the cell block, passing corridor after corridor, following the ache in her chest. It grew sharper and sharper, til there was an all encompassing heat fanning through her chest.</p><p>Then, as Hermione turned a corner, she sucked in a gasp. A swarming hive of dementors lay before her, their shadowy, cloaked bodies flying in circular motion. </p><p>Out of the eye of the swirling hurricane, one swooped down to the floor, and that’s when she caught sight of something rather odd.</p><p>A dark figure, lying lifeless on the floor. It seemed to take the form of a man, but the body had no edges. Hermione blinked, convinced that her eyes were playing tricks on her.</p><p>Another dementor swooped down, taking the place of the other, and she realized what was happening.</p><p>They were performing <em> the kiss </em>.</p><p>But how? If the figure wasn’t human…</p><p>She gazed at the strange black mass, which seemed to form a body not unlike a man’s, but more like to that of a beast or an egyptian god.</p><p><em> No, </em> she thought. <em> No, it can’t be. </em></p><p>She looked up to the storm of dementors that mirrored the tempest outside.</p><p>All at once, Hermione rushed forward and lifted her wand.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Tom was so cold. Even without his physical body, even allowing his soul to be possessed by dark magic, he felt the effects of the dementors like he never had before. </p><p>He wasn’t used to this. He’d evaded one, and then another, but when the creatures of darkness banded together and blocked his exit, he succumbed to the aching despair.</p><p>He couldn’t conjure the patronus. He feared to, as many lives as he’d taken and as much dark magic as he’d partaken of, there was every possibility that his own patronus would consume him as was the case with the dark wizard Raczidian. He didn’t dare attempt it.</p><p>At first, he’d merely felt sluggish, his magic weary and drained from the taxing feat of remaining corporeal so long. Everywhere he turned, there were dementors. They corralled him, herding him like a pack of sharks.</p><p>But it was the feeling of Hermione’s despair that crippled him. He heard her screams in his ears, feeling himself being driven to madness by her pain. It was as if he were inside her as she was being tortured, but could do nothing to stop it. He was racked with agony, reliving the moment he’d seen in her memories when she writhed under a woman’s cruciatus, the sharp sting of a knife dragging across her flesh.</p><p>
<em> Where are you? </em>
</p><p>He heard her voice, sweet as honey, but laced with fear.</p><p>
<em> Tom, where are you? </em>
</p><p>He was surely hallucinating. </p><p>His eyes opened to a black whirlwind, a maelstrom of phantom spectres circling him like vultures. </p><p>He was their prey.</p><p><em> Hermione</em>, he managed. <em> Are you here, or am I mad? </em></p><p>He was certain he was trapped in a fever dream. Tom reached out, turning, trying to crawl across the damp stone. He tried to pull himself back into consciousness, but he teetered on the brink, drowning in a plane of despair.</p><p>Suddenly, out of the darkness of the vortex, a wraith of death flew down and Tom felt his heart being ripped out through his throat.</p><p>He disappeared into blackness.</p><p>....</p><p>
<em>All was quiet, except the soft sobbing of a woman. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Tom wasn’t sure where he was. He was in a place of darkness, almost reminiscent of a train station, but the sky was red and black, and the mass of bricks which made up the columns leaked with blood. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Where am I? he thought with alarm.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Another ripping sensation in his chest. He doubled over in agony.</em>
</p><p>
<em>The sound of sobs reached his ears.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Tom turned, clutching at his chest to determine the whereabouts of the sound. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Then, he saw her. A woman, nearly naked and in rags, her skin pale and her hair in knots. Her spine showed through her meager clothing. She was on her knees, hunched over on the concrete floor, mere feet away from where he stood.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Tom cocked his head, taking several steps closer.</em>
</p><p>
<em>He almost reached out a hand, but another sharp pain rose up from his ribcage into his throat. Tom coughed, and in this strange place, blackness came up from his lungs.</em>
</p><p>
<em>He felt himself fading more and more into this place… it slowly materialized into reality.</em>
</p><p>
<em>He continued to approach the woman who cried softly. </em>
</p><p>
<em>“Hello?” he asked. The moment he spoke, she whipped around sharply and he fell back several steps in terror.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Her eyes were black and her teeth sharp. Her cheeks were gaunt and her features disproportionate. She looked like some fearsome creature from a fairytale.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Who are you?” she asked in a rasping voice.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“I’m Tom Riddle.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>The woman cocked her head, an inhuman movement that caused Tom to shiver.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“You can’t be. I watched them drag him into the water.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>“I don’t know what the bloody hell you’re talking about.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>She slinked closer, causing Tom to back away a step. Her black eyes cut over to him as she peered upward.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Unless… are you… my son?”</em>
</p><p>
<em>Tom’s brows furrowed as he gazed back at the creature.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Suddenly, she let out a piercing wail, leaping closer to Tom to his utter terror. “My son!” she screamed. “Not my son!”</em>
</p><p>
<em>She fell upon him, gripping his shoulders with vicious strength. Her nails were long and sharp, and bit into his flesh.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“You must go, boy,” she whispered into his ear. “They are coming. They will take us both if they find us.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>Tom heard the sound of a train in the distance. The blood red sky was darkening, and night was beginning to fall in this strange plane.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Where am I?” he asked the strange woman. “Is this real?”</em>
</p><p>
<em>She seemed not to hear his question, her black eyes roving his face, her intrusive fingers touching him all over. </em>
</p><p>
<em>“No, no… you’re not here yet. Go back! Go back, I say!” She ran her sharp, filthy nails through his hair. “Such a handsome boy. So like your father. Nothing like your cursed mother.” </em>
</p><p>
<em>Tom froze, looking down at the woman. He clutched at his throat as another bolt of pain struck his chest, his heart twisting in turmoil. “Mother?”</em>
</p><p>
<em>She smiled, her sharp teeth gray and rotting. “I so wanted to stay for you, my son. I loved you so, yes. You were mine… never his.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>Tom’s eyes were wide, fixed on the woman, shock etched into his features. His lips parted, but he could form no words. </em>
</p><p>
<em>There was a screeching cry in the distance, and her head whipped around. She turned back to him in distress. “Go now! Go back! They cannot find you here.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>Light started to cloud his vision. </em>
</p><p>
<em>“Where is here?”</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Never come here, my son. Never . Go!”</em>
</p><p>
<em>The woman’s face became fuzzy and distorted. </em>
</p><p>
<em>“No, wait!” he shouted, overcome with confusion. “I have to know where you are!”</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Go to her, Tom!” came the woman’s hoarse voice, sounding more distant by the minute. “I will pray to the gods for you. My precious son.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>Tom’s face twisted with anguish. Her words penetrated some deep place within him that had remained untouched for years, uncovering a festering, black wound. He felt cold, empty. </em>
</p><p>
<em>He felt entirely gutted.</em>
</p><p>Light suddenly shone behind his eyes, obscuring the strange train station. There was nothing but brilliance, a silvery, incandescent glow all around him. That light was all that existed, and with it, warmth.</p><p>Like the heat of the sun on his skin.</p><p>But he had no skin, he remembered. Reality began to come back to Tom in small doses. The body of darkness, his drained magical stores. He had no energy to move, but he recalled a swirling storm of dementors. </p><p>A prison with damp floors.</p><p>He felt the amorphous pain of his magic straining to remain intact, his magical core sore and bruised. </p><p>Then, finally, he opened his eyes.</p><p>The light was far too brilliant. It took him several moments for his eyesight to adjust.</p><p>He cocked his head, feeling the rough stone beneath him. Above him, a giant Phoenix flapped its flaming wings, dripping white fire from its tail as it chased the shadowy dementors away. Tom heard their feral screams as they escaped through the prison windows. </p><p>Hundreds of them, they flew in droves from the corridor to escape the fiery Phoenix.</p><p>Tom began to come fully into reality.</p><p>He tried to move his hands and arms, but he was pinned to the floor.</p><p>He turned his head and caught sight of Hermione. </p><p>She was there, after all.</p><p>That drew Tom’s attention. He managed to turn onto his side, pushing himself up onto his elbows. </p><p>She knelt at his side. “Tom! Is it you? Why do you look like this?”</p><p>He blinked, unsure of why she suddenly appeared as an angel, her aura glowing with a bright fire.</p><p>“Why are you here, little witch?” he rasped.</p><p>“Your voice,” she whispered. “Why do you sound like that?”</p><p>“Get out of here, Hermione.”</p><p>“Fuck you, you arse,” she huffed. “You almost got yourself killed.”</p><p>The sounds of voices began to drift closer, and Hermione stood quickly. </p><p>Tom turned and began to try to stand as footsteps padded up the stairs at the end of the hall. He looked up to see two aurors emerge from the stairwell, but before he could blink, Hermione had aimed her wand at the ceiling. </p><p>“Bombarda maxima!”</p><p>The ceiling came tumbling down between them and the aurors. Dust and stone cascaded down, but Tom reached out a hand, wandlessly conjuring a barrier.</p><p>A man climbed down the rubble, the prisoner from the level above. He immediately took off running, disappearing into the darkness of the maze.</p><p>She couldn't worry about it. Hermione knelt beside Tom. “Can you stand?” She waved her wand, casting a rejuvenation charm. </p><p>Tom chuckled. “That won’t work on me in this state, darling.”</p><p>“Good to see you’re feeling better.”</p><p>He stood, then pulled her against him. “Get out of here. Now.”</p><p>“Like hell,” she gritted out. “You take this wanker and go.” She pointed to the window, where Dolohov stood in binds. Tom would’ve laughed if he hadn’t been so concerned for her safety. </p><p>“I have to get Rosier.”</p><p>“No, Tom. Leave Rosier. I can get him acquitted. If you take him, it will make things worse.”</p><p>The voices of the aurors rose on the other side of the rubble.</p><p>She tried to pull away, but he gripped her arm, jerking her against him. “Are you sure about that?”</p><p>“Yes, Tom. If you take him, it will be like admitting guilt. They don’t have anything on him. We can get him free.”</p><p>Tom glanced at Dolohov, then back to Hermione. “Did you cast that patronus?”</p><p>Hermione’s eyes searched his face, and he realized he must look frightening in his current state. </p><p>“Yes. They were performing the kiss, Tom.”</p><p>“Impressive.”</p><p>Hermione glanced back at the rubble, which the aurors were beginning to blast through. </p><p>“We don’t have much time, Tom. You need to go.”</p><p>He shook his head. “I’m not going anywhere without you.”</p><p>“I’m an auror! I’m safe.”</p><p>Tom was already assessing the height of the window from the ocean below. “An auror who is currently barred from the case, and one who just aided a criminal in escaping. I’m not leaving you here.”</p><p>Tom turned to Dolohov. “This part of the prison extends over the ocean. You’ll have to jump, Max. There’s no other way out, unless you feel like duelling a pack of aurors. Do you think you can swim to shore? Malfoy is there waiting.” </p><p>Dolohov looked dubious, but reluctantly nodded his head.</p><p>Tom turned to Hermione. “Do you have your wand?”</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>“Can you cast the bubblehead charm?”</p><p>She nodded hesitantly. “I think so.”</p><p>“Cast it on Max.”</p><p>Her gaze met Dolohov’s, and his dark brown eyes narrowed menacingly. The death eater turned to Tom. “She’s not casting fuck all on me.”</p><p>“Then I suppose you can rot in this prison. You’re already lucky I came for you, and you can thank a certain Black for that.”</p><p>Dolohov gritted his teeth, but said nothing as Hermione cast the charm and released him from his binds.</p><p>He and Tom leaned out of the rectangular shaped window to gaze at the crashing waves below. </p><p>The rain obscured their view somewhat, the abyss of the ocean lit momentarily by a lightning strike, followed closely by a peal of thunder.</p><p>“Tom,” Hermione said, her tone a warning. </p><p>He looked back to see the aurors beginning to break through the rubble.</p><p>“Go,” he said sharply to Dolohov, and before the wizard could respond, he shoved him through the opening.</p><p>Tom snatched Hermione’s wand and aimed it with precision. “Arresto momentum,” he called out into the night.</p><p>Tom watched as the wizard’s fall slowed, and his death eater fell gently into the crashing waves.</p><p>“Now it’s your turn, darling,” Tom said, his red eyes laughing with humor. </p><p>Hermione’s eyes grew wide. “You’re out of your bloody mind! I’m <em> not </em> doing that!”</p><p>“Then I suppose there’s only one other alternative.”</p><p>Tom wrapped his arms around her tightly and lifted her onto the ledge. </p><p>“Tom,” she said firmly. “What are you doing?”</p><p>“Put your arms around my neck.”</p><p>“I absolutely will not-“</p><p>“Trust me.”</p><p>Her eyes searched his face, trying to see some essence of Tom in the strange being of darkness who held her.</p><p>Her heart beat swiftly as his glowing red eyes returned her appraisal. Then he leaned forward and kissed her, and for a moment, her eyes fell shut. </p><p>His magic wrapped itself around them, concealing them both in a cocoon of shadows.</p><p>She opened her eyes, but saw nothing but two brilliant red eyes glowing at her in the darkness. She closed her eyes again, reveling in the delicious feeling of his strange lips against hers. His tongue swiped against her lips, a silent demand for her to open to him, and she answered, parting her lips with a soft moan to allow his tongue to move against her own. </p><p>Her arms tightened around his neck, and she barely noticed when their feet left the ground. Her hands stroked the hardness of his shoulders, marveling at the form he’d taken without his physical body, a form built purely of dark magic. He felt real, but also intangible. A pang of desire shot through her as he kissed her, thrusting his tongue against hers.</p><p>Suddenly, the shadows disappeared, and she looked down, only to give a sharp gasp. She clung to him even tighter, her heart dropping into her stomach. </p><p>“Why isn’t it raining?” she murmured against his throat.</p><p>His deep laughter rang out. “Because we’re above the clouds.”</p><p>She snuck a peek out of the corner of her eye, to see the dark gray storm clouds floating just beneath them, illuminated intermittently with brilliant flashes of lightning. She gave a secretive smile.</p><p>“How are you doing this, Tom?”</p><p>“Are you impressed?”</p><p>“Very.”</p><p>He leaned closer, a whisper of shadows against the shell of her ear. “I would have to say the feeling is mutual, little witch.”</p><p>As they flew through the night, there was no hint of trepidation, or fear of what was to come. There was no anxiousness over his almost death, or her precarious position with the auror department. </p><p>There was only hope, and trust, and the awe of two soulmates desperately in love.</p><p>He flew them in silence for several minutes, gliding across a floor of electromagnetic energy as if it were nothing. <br/>
<br/>
After a space, he spoke. "Look, little witch. There."<br/>
<br/>
She followed his line of sight to see a brilliant golden spark in the sky. As the spark neared, it grew into a flame, contrasted with the night sky. </p><p>Then, Hermione recognized the source of the flames.<br/>
<br/>
Her phoenix, Seraphina, was flying directly toward them, her great wings beating heavily, edged with golden fire.</p><p>Hermione laughed, then rested her head on Tom's shoulder. She hadn't realized how much tension had been housed in her body until now. <br/>
<br/>
When Seraphina reached them, the majestic bird turned about and flew beside them, singing a piercing song.<br/>
<br/>
Hermione felt herself being strengthened, the song of the phoenix refreshing her body and mind, and bolstering her magic. <br/>
<br/>
"She's healing us, Hermione."<br/>
<br/>
Hermione wrapped her hand around the base of his neck, threading her fingers into the tendrils of darkness.</p><p>"Tom..."</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>"Don't frighten me like that... Ever again."<br/>
<br/>
"Deal." He kissed the top of her head. "I need you, little witch."<br/>
<br/>
Hermione reached out her hand to the soaring phoenix, and as she touched its fiery feathers, in the span of a moment, the celestial threesome disappeared with a resounding clap and the sizzle of gilded flames.</p>

<p>Malfoy dragged Dolohov’s exhausted body out of the water, then immediately apparated them to Malfoy Manor. </p><p>Aurors showed up, insisting on searching the manor, but by then, Malfoy had safely hidden the escaped prisoner in a secret passageway, deep below the dungeons.</p><p>When the manor had been fully searched and law enforcement had left, Malfoy retrieved him and had the family healer assess him.</p><p>Aside from hypothermia, which he was given a potion to treat, he was diagnosed with permanent nerve damage.</p><p>They both knew it wasn’t due to his stint in Azkaban.</p><p>“All this because you cast the wrong bloody spell. Why did you do it? Have you entirely lost the plot?” spat Malfoy. </p><p>Max shook his head. “They shouldn’t have known, Malfoy. About <em> morsmordre </em> . It was that Dumbledore bitch. She was the cause of my arrest. Avery went by the potions shop and spoke with Mulpepper. She was there.” He shook his head, his anger seething. “She knows too much. She’s probably convinced Tom to spill it all. Can you imagine if the DMLE gets inside her head? They’ll know <em> everything </em>.”</p><p>“He isn’t that thick, Max. He wouldn’t compromise us, even for her. You’re overestimating her. He might be infatuated with a bit of cunt but our goals still remain.” </p><p>Dolohov scoffed. “You’re a thick one, Malfoy.”</p><p>“He got you out, didn’t he? Even though he said you were finished. That doesn’t seem like someone who’s changed allegiance.”</p><p>Dolohov was quiet for a moment. “He said I could thank Walburga. Where is she?”</p><p>Malfoy rolled his eyes. “On holiday in France, with Ciggy. He’s returned from Hogwarts for the summer.”</p><p>“Get me an owl. I need to talk to her.”</p><p>“You need to rest.”</p><p>Dolohov reached out and snatched Malfoy forward by his collar. “Get me a <em> bloody </em> owl!”</p><p>Malfoy glared at him. “You’ll be going to Albania, into hiding until we figure out what to do about your charges. Tom is running for minister, and perhaps he can-“</p><p>“I’m not going to Albania. I’m staying right here.”</p><p>“You can’t. You’ll be discovered sooner or later. Every auror in Britain will be looking for you.”</p><p>“I’m not leaving her. I’m staying.”</p><p>“That will be up to Tom.”</p><p>“To hell with Tom!”</p><p>Malfoy glared at him. “I’ve had enough of you. If it weren’t for Tom, I’d turn you back over myself.”</p><p>Dolohov’s eyes took on a crazed glint. “He will marry her… the Dumblebitch. Then you’ll be looking for another Dark Lord. Mark my words.”</p><p>Malfoy was silent for several moments.</p><p>“Well, then… if that happens, perhaps I will reassess our position. But not before.” He sneered at Dolohov, looking down his aristocratic nose at the haggard wizard. “I think you’ve got bigger things to worry about than Tom, don’t you?”</p><p>Malfoy cut off any reply as he turned on his heel and walked out, his long ponytail swinging behind him.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Tom settled between Hermione’s thighs. She stirred in her sleep, instinctually slipping her arms around his neck. He pressed his hard cock against her heat, sliding against her, creating tantalizing friction. </p><p>“Good morning,” he murmured against her hair.</p><p>She hummed, slowly rising to consciousness. “Good morning,” she whispered, her eyes still closed.</p><p>“You were a very bad witch last night,” he breathed. He slipped his hand between them, his cool fingers touching her gently where she was bare.</p><p>Hermione rubbed her lips together, then slowly opened her eyes. The minute they found Tom, she fought back a smile, prompting him to flash his brilliant white teeth in a devastating grin. </p><p>“Had I known you’d enjoy fucking my shadow self, I would’ve done so sooner. It was an entirely different experience.”</p><p>She rolled her eyes but couldn’t help but smile. “How did you do that? I’ve never heard of that kind of magic.”</p><p>His eyes roved her face hungrily, then lowered until his hot breath fell against her ear. “It’s dark magic, darling. The kind that corrupts the soul.”</p><p>She shivered at the sound of his voice, hoarse from sleep and desire.</p><p>“You have to go to the precinct, Tom. Your wand is there. They want to question you.”</p><p>He ground his hips against hers. “I'm not going anywhere until I’ve had a taste of you.”</p><p>Suddenly, Hermione froze, her smile falling.</p><p>“The guard.”</p><p>Tom blinked. “What guard?”</p><p>Her lips parted, shock registering on her features. “I… I used the imperius on the prison guard. Last night.”</p><p>Tom gazed at her, blinking, then his lips parted, and curled into a devilish grin.</p><p>“You… <em> imperiused… </em> the guard?”</p><p>She gulped. Then nodded.</p><p>He threw his head back and laughed.</p><p>She slapped his bare chest. “It isn’t funny, Tom! I could be arrested. I forgot to obliviate her!”</p><p>Tom didn’t stop laughing. He ran his tongue over his teeth, shaking his head. </p><p>“Don’t worry, darling. I’ll take care of the guard.”</p><p>“It might be too late!”</p><p>“I guarantee they’re still combing the area for Dolohov. It’s still early. I’ll go take care of the guard, then I’ve got to go see Malfoy.” His eyes flicked to hers. “I’ll be out of the country through tomorrow. I’ve got to see that Dolohov is hidden away.”</p><p>“Tom… they were looking for you at your flat last night. I lied to them. That’s the only way I could get your body here.” She shook her head. “It was incredibly dangerous, what you did.”</p><p>“You put them in there, little witch. I had to get them out.” He sighed. “I hope you’re right about getting Rosier acquitted. Otherwise, I’ll have to get him out, which will be even harder now.”</p><p>“I can do it, Tom. I have the connections. I’m sure his father does, as well.”</p><p>He snorted. “Perhaps I’ll just pardon him if I win the election.”</p><p>She gave him a disapproving look.</p><p>He smirked. “What is power, little witch, if you can’t use it for your own gain?”</p><p>She rolled her eyes, but he reached out and took her chin between his fingers. “Thank you, Hermione. For breaking all of your rules for me.” His eyes fell to her lips. “You’re a force to be reckoned with… my perfect match.”</p><p>She lifted an eyebrow. “Which reminds me… what is this soulmate bond that Slughorn seems to know about?”</p><p>Tom’s eyebrows lifted, and he chuckled. “A secret for a secret, my dear. I’ll be cashing in on your promise soon enough.” His thumb dragged her bottom lip down. “Then I’ll tell you everything you want to know.” He leaned down and his lips brushed the shell of her ear. “Even my deepest, <em> darkest </em> secrets.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Tom showered and then left, but not before Hermione convinced him to obliviate her memories from the night before, replacing them with memories of a comfortable evening in his flat.</p><p>“It’s a shame to obliviate the <em> entire </em> night,” he muttered with a wink. “But I suppose it’s unavoidable. We will just have to do <em> that </em> again, won’t we?”</p><p>Heat crept into Hermione’s cheeks, painting them a bright pink.</p><p>He lifted her wand and performed the spell. Then he leaned in to kiss her, and a moment later, he was gone.</p><p>Hermione threw on her auror robes, struck with the vague sense that she was forgetting something.</p><p>In the end, she shrugged it away and left for work.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>As soon as Hermione stepped into the auror department, every eye turned toward her. </p><p>She paused just inside the door, her gaze meeting theirs one by one.</p><p>“What’s wrong?” she asked, confusion tinting her features. “What’s happened?”</p><p>Gaspard’s office door opened. “Dumbledore… may I see you in my office for a moment?”</p><p>Hermione glanced about her, feeling apprehension building in her chest. She gave a short nod, and made her way past the cubicles to follow him into the office. </p><p>She sat before his desk and he closed the door.</p><p>Gaspard lingered for a moment, his hand still upon the doorknob. Hermione felt his presence at her back, but dared not turn around.</p><p>After a few moments, he crossed the room and took a seat at his desk. He turned his vacant gaze upon her, his blue eyes icy and pained.</p><p>“Hermione, where were you last night?”</p><p>She blinked a few times, lips parted. “I was at home.”</p><p>A pause. “At home?”</p><p>She cleared her throat. “Well… not home, exactly. I was at Tom's flat.”</p><p>“Riddle, I’m assuming.”</p><p>“Yes,” she said, tilting her head slightly. “Andrew should know. He came by with a team of hit wizards. For what, I haven’t been informed.”</p><p>“Then you’re aware that Riddle should be here for questioning.”</p><p>She nodded slowly. “He will be. I believe he had to stop by his employer’s to ask off for the morning.”</p><p>His cheek muscle flexed. He leaned forward, folding his hands on the desk as he observed her, eyes narrowed. “It’s strange. Two of my aurors swear that they saw you last night at Azkaban prison.”</p><p>“What are they claiming to have seen?”</p><p>His jaw muscles tensed. “You. Standing beneath a frenzy of dementors.”</p><p>Hermione took a deep breath. “Like I said, I was at Tom’s flat all night.”</p><p>“There’s been a breakout. Maximilian Dolohov has escaped.”</p><p>Her mouth fell open. “You think I had something to do with it?”</p><p>Gaspard leaned back, rubbing his chin thoughtfully. “No. I think Riddle did it, but I can’t prove it. I think you intervened because something went wrong.”</p><p>Hermione said nothing. She merely stared at him blankly, betraying nothing.</p><p>“Let me ask you something, trainee. If I were to perform <em> Prior Incantato </em> on your wand… what would I find?”</p><p>Hermione’s heart beat wildly.</p><p>She was beginning to put the pieces of the puzzle together.</p><p>She had been there. At the prison.</p><p>Tom must have tampered with her memories.</p><p>She swallowed. “Don’t you… need a wand war-“</p><p>“I am acting Minister, Miss Dumbledore. Until the election is over.”</p><p>Hermione nodded slowly, meeting his gaze squarely.</p><p>“Do whatever you have to do, Gaspard. I won’t hold it against you.”</p><p>His eyes fell shut, and he exhaled, lowering his head to the desk. “<em> Why </em>, Hermione?”</p><p>Silence stifled the room for a minute. Hermione could feel his disappointment and despair as a tangible thing.</p><p>“Is there anything you wouldn’t have done to protect Rose? Even if it meant breaking the law?”</p><p>Gaspard sighed. He lifted his head from the desk and sat back, his eyes flicking to the portrait of his wife which hung on the wall.</p><p>A lovely red-haired witch in a pale pink dress smiled back at him from the moving portrait. </p><p>Then his gaze wandered back to Hermione.</p><p>“She’s not here,” he whispered, his eyes intense as they rested on her. “But you are. So I suppose you’re right, and I will break the law. Because I’ll do what I have to do to protect you, while you’re my responsibility… even if it means risking my job.”</p><p>“I’m not your responsibility, Gaspard. I’m a grown witch, and I’ve made my choices. You don’t owe me anything.”</p><p>He swallowed. “I do owe Dumbledore. I owe him quite a lot… and, it was him who asked me to watch after you. Technically, you are allowed to use the Unforgivables in rare circumstances as an auror, if that did, in fact, take place. I won’t search your wand, Hermione. Nor will I perform legilimency, although I’d prefer if you didn’t <em>lie</em> <em>to me</em>.”</p><p>Hermione looked down at her hands. “I’m sorry, Gaspard.”</p><p>He gazed at her with barely concealed rage. It was the first time she’d seen that particular emotion behind his eyes. “While I do admire your sense of loyalty… Riddle is dangerous. Your future is too bright to follow this dark path with him. I’m begging you, Hermione. Don’t do this. He will destroy you.”</p><p>Hermione said nothing, because for all appearances, he was absolutely right. </p><p>She could not argue.</p><p>The only thing telling her differently was her heart, and <em> it </em> would not be dissuaded.</p><p>Her heart wanted Tom Riddle, and Tom Riddle only.</p><p>Her eyes met his, and there was a plea within them.</p><p>“I have to say this, Hermione. If I don’t, I’ll regret it. I know you’ve chosen him, but I’m asking you respectfully to reconsider.”</p><p>Her eyebrows rose in surprise.</p><p>“Can you do that for me, Hermione? Can you at least think about it? At least allow yourself to imagine another alternative. Whether it’s me or anyone else. He’s not good for you… and I think you know that.” </p><p>He gazed at her intently.</p><p>Within him, she saw a powerful Wizard. One with absolutely everything she could’ve hoped for in a man. Power, strength, character, loyalty, and enough darkness to make life interesting.</p><p>It played out before her, their life together. She could see it clearly, like a film reel playing on the wall before her.</p><p>“Yes. I can do that, Gaspard.”</p><p>He nodded slowly. “That’s all I’m asking.”</p><p>She agreed only because she owed it to herself.</p><p>Her life hung in the balance, after all.</p><p>“I’m going to resign, Gaspard.”</p><p>He gazed at her blankly, like a statue of stone, no shock registering in his expression, but she knew it was there nonetheless.</p><p>“I’ve put you in a bad position, and I know if it were any other auror, you’d let them go. Or worse, have them investigated. I’m not going to continue to make your job harder, and…. I’m going to run for minister.”</p><p>Gaspard blinked several times. </p><p>Then he sat back, swallowing as he watched her. “I don’t think that’s necessary, Hermione.”</p><p>“It’s my choice.”</p><p>His eyes fell closed, and he sighed. Then he leaned his head back, pinching his nose between his thumb and forefinger.</p><p>When he finally looked up again, he muttered, “It will be a shame to see you go, Dumbledore.”</p><p>“I’m sorry I’ve made a mess of your department. It’s not how I planned for my time here to go. I hope you can forgive me.”</p><p>He twisted his lips to the side, deep in thought. At length, he asked, “Do you really think, given the events of last night, that you are ready to be Minister for Magic?”</p><p>Hermione took a deep breath. “Perhaps not, but I know that I can do some good. There are many things that need to change in our world.”</p><p>He nodded slowly. “Yes, that is certain. I have no doubt that you could do good. But you have baggage by the name of Tom Riddle, and that’s what concerns me. He is your blind spot.”</p><p>“You could always run, Gaspard. You’d do much better than I would, truth be told.”</p><p>He scoffed. “I’ve never wanted it. I still don’t. Politics is not my fortè.”</p><p>Hermione gave a slight nod, then she looked down at her hands. “I should probably go.”</p><p>He looked at her, his expression betraying his reluctance to see her leave.</p><p>He gave a short nod, then stood.</p><p>She followed him to the door, and then she turned to him. “Thank you, Gaspard. For everything. I hope that, no matter what happens, we can be friends. I value you in my life.” She looked down at her hands. “You’ve been better to me than I deserve.”</p><p>He watched her for a moment, his jaw muscles rippling. Then, he took a deep breath. “I’d like to say it’s because I promised Dumbledore, but I think if I’m being honest with myself, I would’ve made exceptions for you, regardless.”</p><p>Hermione’s eyes found his, and as they stared at one another, he reached up a hand and brushed a tendril of hair from her temple. Hermione held her breath, confusion washing over her like a cold shower.</p><p>Then, he blinked, and dropped his hand. “Please take care, Dumbledore.”</p><p>“You too, Gaspard.”</p><p>Hermione dipped her head, then opened the door, and quietly left his office.</p><p> </p><hr/><p><br/>
Hermione returned to her flat that evening, after a brief check-in at the factory. She hung her auror robes up for the last time, having already turned in her badge prior to leaving the Ministry. </p><p>Her fellow aurors watched her go with sad eyes, tinged with bewilderment.</p><p>Hermione changed into her nightgown and a robe, desperately needing a night alone with her thoughts. She popped the cork of a bottle of elf-made wine, imported from Italy, and poured herself a glass. Piksy had long since gone to bed, since she had been busy with her duties at the factory of late.</p><p>Seraphina rested on her perch in the sitting room, peacefully asleep. </p><p>Hermione curled up on her velvet sofa, wondering where Tom was, and what he was doing.</p><p>Gaspard’s words echoed in her ears, troubling her.</p><p>Was he right? Was Tom truly a blind spot for her?</p><p>It hadn’t been too long ago, after all, that she’d sworn to never speak to him again. </p><p>But that night at Ostara, his gilded tongue had swayed her thinking.</p><p>He’d sounded so sincere, pledging his love for her, plying her with soft pleas and entreating glances.</p><p>Hermione took a sip of her wine, feeling terribly confused.</p><p>She hadn’t really given Gaspard a chance. In her heart, Tom had still held her in a vice-like grip, an unbreakable hold upon her affection.</p><p>However, she was still faced with the reality of his death eaters, and his plans, and his horcruxes…</p><p>Those things still terrified Hermione.</p><p>Even now, she found herself lying for him, breaking the law for him…</p><p>She was no better than Bellatrix Lestrange, Hermione realized in horror.</p><p>But the difference was that Tom loved Hermione… right?</p><p>Had Bella convinced herself of the same thing?</p><p>Hermione sat on her couch, wondering what to do.</p><p>A wizard with two horcruxes, and plans for more…</p><p>His words rang in her ear.</p><p><em> Fuck blood purity </em> , <em> fuck them all, you’re mine </em>.</p><p>Hermione looked back over the events of the past sixteen months. </p><p>It was strange, wasn’t it? To be thrown so far back in time. To find herself now running for Minister, in such a short window of time.</p><p>It was almost as if fate had played a hand in her new life.</p><p>She thought back to the French woman, to the strange reading she’d been given. She thought about Slughorn’s comments, picturing Tom’s mouth as he uttered the words, “I’ll do anything for my soulmate.”</p><p>Hermione didn’t think she believed in fate. But she couldn’t deny that something was at work in these circumstances, something beyond herself.</p><p>She’d always thought fate and divination to be rubbish, but now seeing how her life had changed…</p><p>Seeing the way that Harry’s fate had played out exactly according to prophecy…</p><p>It made Hermione question her stance.</p><p>“What do you want me to do?” she whispered to the air. “Why am I here?”</p><p>It was as if the universe had already answered her before she asked, because in her heart, she knew exactly why she was here.</p><p>Some part of her had known it all along.</p><p>Could a lonely orphan boy really be redeemed? </p><p>Could his path digress so sharply from one bent on destruction… because of her?</p><p><em> Marry me, Hermione </em>.</p><p>Hermione felt the breath leaving her lungs as Tom’s entreaty rang in her ears.</p><p>She began to contemplate Gaspard’s words.</p><p>
<em> I’m asking you respectfully to reconsider. </em>
</p><p>Hermione sighed, and leaned back so that her gaze rested on the ceiling. She traced the elaborate crown molding with her eyes.</p><p>She knew the time was swiftly approaching when she would have to tell Tom everything.</p><p>In fact, she was on borrowed time as it stood.</p><p>Was Tom truly her fate, or was she potentially casting aside a healthy relationship with Gaspard in favor of a childish fantasy?</p><p>She was attracted to Gaspard. She admired him, enjoyed his company.</p><p>Hermione was nothing if not practical.</p><p>She preferred books, facts, and formulas, not hunches, inclinations, and prophecies.</p><p>To believe in something as ambiguous as fate was difficult for her, if not nearly impossible. </p><p>Although…</p><p>Hermione did feel it was wise to leave room for the possibility, but the dilemma was that it drove Hermione crazy <em> not to know </em> for certain.</p><p>It petrified her, the thought that she might make a foolish decision based solely on her feelings and emotions, which she already knew could not be trusted… <em> especially </em> where Tom was involved.</p><p>Hermione tipped back her glass of wine, draining its contents as the dark liquid coated her tongue.</p><p>Suddenly, an idea came to Hermione.</p><p>She stood and walked, barefoot, into her bedroom. In her closet stood a jewelry chest. She opened the top drawer and withdrew a tiny velvet drawstring bag.</p><p>She shook it, and she could hear the knocking of two stones together…</p><p>… the seer stones, <em>Urim</em> and <em>Thummim</em>.</p><p>Tom’s Christmas gift.</p><p>
<em> Some believe that God speaks through these stones, and reveals his will. Others believe that fate will show itself through them. You would ask a question, and then draw a stone. They are a type of oracle, a way of seeing which is the correct path to take. </em>
</p><p>Hermione turned and walked to the bed, then sat  on its edge. She held the bag in her hand, gazing down at it apprehensively.</p><p>If she was supposed to believe in fate… then why couldn’t fate meet her halfway?</p><p>The two magical stones she held in her hand were famed throughout history. Hermione almost laughed at the simplicity of it… two pebbles in a bag.</p><p>She didn’t sense anything overtly magical about them.</p><p>It was so silly… a fable that belonged in The Tales of Beedle the Bard. </p><p>Although, now that Hermione thought about it, she had been wrong about the Deathly Hallows. </p><p>They were very, very real.</p><p>Hermione took a deep breath.</p><p>“Time to put fate to the test,” she exhaled.</p><p>She decided that if she drew the black stone, she would tell Tom everything, and in that way, she would choose him.</p><p>The white stone would represent Gaspard, or any other alternative not involving Tom Riddle.</p><p>She swallowed thickly, and her eyelids fell shut. </p><p>“Who would fate have me choose?” she asked in the softest whisper </p><p>Then she reached into the bag and withdrew a stone.</p><p>Suddenly, the room disappeared into a bright light, and Hermione was engulfed in a vision.</p>

</p><p> </p><p>The evening was fading, and Tom was seated in his armchair, the first edition of <em>the Chronomancer</em> spread out across his lap, which featured him on the front page. He looked up as he heard Hermione apparate into the sitting room.</p><p>Hermione’s heels clicked on the wood floors of Tom’s flat.</p><p>“I’m ready.”</p><p>Tom tilted his head, eyes narrowing. “For what?”</p><p>“To tell you. Everything.”</p><p>He blinked a few times, then promptly closed his book as he took in her appearance. “When? Now?”</p><p>Hermione crossed her arms over the trendy cropped jacket of her skirt suit. The collar of her blouse rose up to her neck and tied in a bow, and she wore a fashionable little hat over her smoothed-out curls. “No. I… I have some things I want first.”</p><p>He cocked his head, then stood and walked to his kitchen. A moment later, he returned with a glass of dark wine. “Do you mean that you have demands?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>He sauntered toward her slowly. “Are we negotiating, then?”</p><p>“We are.”</p><p>He laughed under his breath. “You are a smart witch.”</p><p>She lifted a dubious eyebrow. “Are you just now noticing?”</p><p>He stood before her and lifted his hand to her face, dragging his thumb over her bottom lip. “Are you familiar with the story of Esther, little witch?”</p><p>She shook her head. “Only vaguely. My parents weren’t very religious.”</p><p>He nodded to acknowledge her answer as he handed her the glass of wine. “It is a tale from the book of Jews and Christians. A young woman named Esther wanted to protect her people from persecution, so she gave up her maidenhood to spend a night with a Persian King in hopes that she might be chosen as queen. He became enamored of her and made her his queen. When his grand vizier proposed a law to eradicate her people from Persia, Esther approached the king’s throne unbidden, which was an act punishable by death. But he allowed it, and to everyone’s shock, he said to her, “What do you ask of me? I will give you whatever you ask, even up to half of my kingdom.”</p><p>Tom circled around her, until he stood at her back, his chest pressed against her shoulders.</p><p>He slipped an arm around her waist, his hand stroking her stomach. “Are you Esther, my dear? Are you here to spread your legs for the good of your people?”</p><p>Hermione smiled, refusing to take his bait. She lifted the glass to her lips and took a sip, and the dark, bitter liquid stained her mouth, the maroon tannins of the wine sinking into the texture of her lips.</p><p>She licked it off slowly, and his eyes followed the gesture as he leaned over her, pressing his lips to her temple.</p><p>“I am no Esther, Tom. Perhaps I’m more foolish, even, because I fell in love with you.” She took a deep breath, then tore away from him and set the glass aside on the table. “If I hadn’t, I surely would’ve driven a knife into your heart before we ever fucked. That definitely would have made my life easier, but that’s neither here nor there.” His eyes watched her like she was a film star, ravenous, snatching up every detail of her appearance, her demeanor, as if he were cataloging her in case she were to flee again.</p><p>She liked it when he looked at her like this.</p><p>“And your horcruxes, too,” she added, and his black eyes sharpened. “You already know that I know about them, so there’s no point in pretending. You’ll know it all soon enough, anyway.”</p><p>He strode forward, snatching her against him with no gentleness as his mouth crashed onto hers. </p><p>The kiss was obscene, promising carnal acts, promising violence. </p><p>She broke away, gasping for breath. “Besides,” she breathed, “I won’t need half your kingdom. I will have my own.”</p><p>He grinned, his sharply cut cheeks pulling back into a predatory show of teeth. “That you will. I have no doubt of it.” He leaned forward, chasing her mouth, but she pulled back. “But you can have mine too, pretty witch.”</p><p>“You don’t have a kingdom to offer me.”</p><p>He leaned forward, his nose brushing against hers, lips touching her own softly as he whispered, “No. Not yet… but I will. You know that, don’t you? And when I do, it’s yours.” His hands pressed against her back, pushing her against him as he kissed her softly. After a moment, he broke away and muttered, “Give yourself to me, and I will give you everything you’ve ever dreamed of.”</p><p>Hermione swallowed, her eyelashes fluttering against her cheek, her pulse jumping in her veins.</p><p>He always seemed to elicit this sort of unease from her, a fluttering in her stomach, a breathlessness she could never seem to quell. But now, with the imminent discussion looming before her, she knew that he would soon know everything about her life. He would leave no stone unturned, and he would be ruthless in his pursuit of knowledge. </p><p>It made her tremble, the thought of such familiarity. Her life had always been hidden from him, the truth of who she really was locked away, and that was always a comfort to her, an advantage she held over him. </p><p><em> But once the curtain opens, there will be no more pretenses. </em> </p><p>Hermione began to feel the same way that she felt on her last birthday when Tom had commanded her to undress.</p><p>She was afraid of being naked before him, vulnerable.</p><p>He kissed the sensitive place behind her ear, his breath falling against the skin of her neck. </p><p>“What are these demands you have?” he asked.</p><p>Hermione took a deep breath. He lifted his head and she met his gaze. His eyes were searching, both dark and windowless.</p><p>It was now or never.</p><p>“I want you to make an unbreakable vow to me.”</p><p>His eyes were glued to her with intensity. “You seem… rather serious about this.”</p><p>“I am.”</p><p>He watched her for a moment, then nodded slowly. “Very well. What are your terms?”</p><p>“I want… your loyalty.”</p><p>His head cocked slightly, betraying his surprise. “You have that. There was never a question.”</p><p>Hermione bit her lip and looked away.</p><p>His eyes narrowed as realization dawned. “Do you mean… you think I would be unfaithful to you?”</p><p>Hermione looked down at her fingers as they played with one of the buttons on his shirt. “I just… I want you to promise me. That is very important to me.”</p><p>He scoffed. “I was faithful to a witch for six years, and I didn’t even like her. It is not in my nature to be untrue, Hermione. Despite what other flaws you may think me capable of, infidelity is not among them. Most especially where you are involved.”</p><p>Hermione said nothing. She nervously toyed with the top button of his shirt. </p><p>“Easily done,” he said with a shrug. “What else?” he asked, eyeing her with unconcealed curiosity.</p><p>She lifted her eyes to his. “You have to promise that you won’t harm me or anyone that I love if I divulge the truth to you.”</p><p>He blinked twice, then nodded. “That, also, will not be an issue. What else?”</p><p>“You cannot tell or show anyone my secrets. Only Dumbledore knows… and Gaspard.”</p><p>Tom’s head was turned aside but snapped back to attention, crimson flames unfurling in his black irises. “Your <em> boss </em> knows? <em> He </em> knows, but you wouldn’t tell <em> me </em>?” His jaw muscles rippled, displaying his displeasure. “Do you know the lengths I had to go to-“</p><p>“I resigned, Tom.”</p><p>Tom paused. “You what?”</p><p>“I suppose you’ll get what you want. I’ve decided to run for minister.”</p><p>He watched her for a moment, absorbing the information. Then, he nodded again. “Was he angry? About Azkaban? Were you forced to resign?”</p><p>Hermione swallowed, still plucking at his buttons. Tom reached up and took her hand, stilling her hyperactive fingers. She sighed. “More disappointed, I suppose. But to answer your question, no, he was going to cover for me. I resigned of my own accord. It was the right thing to do.”</p><p>His thumb stroked her hand gently. “I won’t share your secrets, Hermione. But I expect to be told exactly what Dufresne knows and how he came to know it.”</p><p>“Agreed.”</p><p>Tom ran his tongue over his top teeth, gazing down at her with something like a glare, a look born of jealousy and intense devotion.</p><p>“Is that all?” he asked. </p><p>Hermione took a deep breath. “Well, no… there is one last thing.” She leaned in a bit closer to him. It was like witchcraft, the way she batted her eyelashes and pressed her distractingly soft body against his, all seduction and feigned innocence. Tom decided that her last request would be, most assuredly, a painful one.</p><p>“You’ve saved the worst for last it seems.”</p><p>“You don’t know what I’m going to say.”</p><p>“I know I’m not going to like it.”</p><p>She flicked her brown doe eyes up at him. They were wide with uncertainty and anxiety, and Tom felt entirely mesmerized by them, despite wanting to resist her childish little game.</p><p>She reached up and slid her hand against his cheek. “I want you to stop making horcruxes.”</p><p>Tom’s lips parted and he froze, for all appearances seeming completely arrested.</p><p>He blinked several times, then slowly extricated himself from her arms, waving his hand to silence her as she began to speak. </p><p>He walked over to the window of his flat, gazing down at the street below. Then he took out his case of cigarettes and pulled one from it, shoving it between his lips and lighting it wandlessly.</p><p>“I knew you’d gut me one day, Hermione.”</p><p>“I suppose we are even then. This is serious for me, Tom. To tell you these things means there’s no going back. It’s only right that you give me something in return. This is what I want, and…” She looked down at her hands. “It’s my way of protecting you.”</p><p>Tom said nothing. He simply stood breathing in the smoke, letting it billow from his lips as he contemplated her request.</p><p>She cleared her throat. “You don’t have to agree, Tom. We can… we can just continue as we are-“</p><p>“No,” he said acidly. “I have to know the truth, Hermione. No, I’ll have to agree. If that’s the only way. But…” He turned around to face her, a slight smile playing on his lips. “We are going to compromise. That’s what married couples do, right? Compromise? We should probably start practicing now.”</p><p>Hermione’s eyes narrowed. She didn’t like the sound of that.</p><p>“What compromise?”</p><p>“You said we were negotiating, did you not? Surely you didn’t think I’d agree to every single term without making my own edits.”</p><p>“Spit it out, Tom.”</p><p>He crossed the room and came to stand before her. He sucked in a deep breath through the cigarette and then reached up to take it between his thumb and forefinger. Smoke poured from his mouth as they regarded one another.</p><p>He pressed his tongue against his cheek, then he spoke. “One more horcrux, and then no more.”</p><p>Hermione chewed her lip as a look of fear crept into her eyes. “They change you, Tom… the horcruxes. I don’t think you understand.”</p><p>“Surely one more won’t make that much difference.”</p><p>“Is that it? Just one more?”</p><p>He nodded. “And one other ask.”</p><p>She narrowed her eyes. “What is it?”</p><p>“I want you to make one.”</p><p>Hermione’s eyes popped out of her skull, her mouth dropping open in shock. “<em> Absolutely </em> not!”</p><p>He smirked. “I’m not asking you to kill someone, Hermione. Only… if it ever happens, I want you to use it, and make a horcrux.”</p><p>Hermione laughed incredulously, her voice dripping with sarcasm as she ejected, “Why waste a perfectly good murder, is that what you’re saying?”</p><p>He shrugged.</p><p>“You frighten me sometimes, Tom.”</p><p>His lips twitched, eyes having faded back to black as he vanished his cigarette. He moved to the table, snatching up a bottle of firewhiskey and poured himself a glass. “You already knew what you were getting into when you came here. You’ve known it from the moment I first kissed you. You’ve always known what I am.” He turned around, lifting the glass to his lips. “I, however, am very curious about <em> Hermione Granger </em>.” </p><p>He swallowed his firewhiskey, then walked over to her and reached up, brushing a curl from her temple. “Who are you really?” He leaned in closer, brushing his lips against her cheek. She could smell the whiskey and smoke on his breath, and she shivered as he whispered, “I want to know everything about you. Feed my obsession, little witch. I beg you.”</p><p>She swallowed thickly. “So… let me be sure I understand you. If I happen to kill someone, accidentally or otherwise, I’ll be bound by an oath to you to make a horcrux.”</p><p>He nodded slowly. “Just as I am bound to never create any… save one, and one only.”</p><p>She took a deep breath. “What if I say no?”</p><p>“Those are my terms.”</p><p>“Then you’ll never know the truth.”</p><p>“Oh, I will know the truth, Hermione. One way or another. However… I would prefer to learn it from you. So I will agree to your terms… as long as you submit to mine.” His lips turned up in a sinister smirk. “<em> Darling </em>.”</p><p>“What if I don’t want to live forever? Would you have me wandering this world forever should I be killed?”</p><p>“That would never happen, my love. I will bring you back.”</p><p>She shook her head, disbelieving. “This is a serious commitment. You’re talking about forever.”</p><p>Ribbons of crimson unfurled in his eyes as he lowered himself to her height, bringing them to eye level. “Do I look anything but serious to you?”</p><p>She gazed at him with wide eyes, and before she even realized she had spoken, the word fell from her lips in the softest breath. “Okay.”</p><p>His eyes narrowed slightly as he watched her, then he reached down to take her small hand in his, and lifted it to his lips. “Who will perform the vow?”</p><p>“Dumbledore.”</p><p>His lips twisted to the side, as if her answer pained him. He sighed, reluctance tinting his expression. “Very well,” he gritted out.</p><p>She watched him for a moment. He ran his tongue over his teeth, tonguing his incisors. </p><p>“Tonight,” he said firmly.</p><p>“You don’t want to think about it more?”</p><p>“No. Tonight.”</p><p>She swallowed, then nodded. “Alright.” Then, her brows furrowed. “Do you not have to work?”</p><p>He shook his head. “I quit.”</p><p>Her eyebrows lifted. “You quit?”</p><p>He nodded, then lifted the glass again to his lips, tossing back the rest of the firewhiskey. “Things are about to move very quickly, little witch. I hope you’re ready.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Dumbledore stood in the loft of his office, beneath the great stone archway. His figure was silhouetted against the diamond-paned window, which displayed the clouded night sky. A full moon glowed incandescently behind the cover of gray clouds, framing them in silver.</p><p>He sighed, and sipped his peach brandy, which he had poured more liberally than usual tonight. His magical instruments whirled and whizzed on their various stands, and on their perch, Fawkes and Seraphina cooed happily as they pecked at a tray of dried, candied fruit. </p><p>Dumbledore steeled himself for what he was about to do.</p><p>There was knock that sounded at the heavy wooden door of his office. Dumbledore waved his wand, and the door opened silently.</p><p>Hermione entered, followed by his former student, Tom Riddle. Dumbledore couldn’t help but feel his muscles tense with unease as he laid eyes on the young man.</p><p>He wouldn’t have chosen such a wizard for his adopted daughter, but he trusted that she would do what she felt was right.</p><p>Dumbledore had always embraced a hands-off approach; that had always been his method. He found that when one tried to steer things too strongly, it always led to disaster. He was a firm believer in fate, and the magic of the universe. He had given his entire life to the study and pursuit of this ambiguous energy called magic.</p><p>He believed that if he did his best, and tried to do good to the best of his ability, that the universe would reward his efforts.</p><p>Dumbledore knew that he couldn’t stop the events that were transpiring. As always, he could only allow them to occur, and stay close, watching and observing. That, he decided, was the best way to protect Hermione.</p><p>As the pair passed by the two phoenixes, the female squawked, running on her perch to where Riddle stood behind Hermione. His brows knit together as a look of shock passed over his face. He glanced at Hermione, whose eyebrows also lifted in surprise, and then up at Dumbledore, who gazed back down at him stoically. </p><p>Tom slowly reached a hand out to the bird, who lowered her head, allowing Tom to run his hand over her plume of feathers, and then down her back. </p><p>Hermione’s lips parted as she gazed at Tom, and their eyes met.</p><p>Dumbledore cleared his throat, and waved them up in silence. The castle was quiet, the students and teachers presumably already in bed.</p><p>Tom took his hand off the bird and moved to lay his palm against Hermione’s lower back, ushering her along in front of him as they ascended the curving staircase, passing by Dumbledore’s climbing shelves of books. From the opposite side of the staircase, the portraits of the previous headmasters eyed them with curiosity.</p><p>They reached the platform and stood before Dumbledore. He looked between them both through his moon-shaped spectacles. His robes were a deep red with gold stitching, highlighting the pronounced difference between their houses. Tom wore black with silver cufflinks, a crisp white shirt, and a green silk tie.</p><p>“Before I do as you have asked, daughter, I will as the both of you once. Are you certain that you want to do this?”</p><p>Tom gave a curt nod. Hermione nodded as well, taking Tom’s hand. “Yes, Albus. We are sure.”</p><p>“Very well,” Dumbledore said, withdrawing his wand. Tom eyed it with narrowed eyes as he held it aloft. “Turn and face one another.”</p><p>Tom and Hermione turned to one another, their eyes locked. Tom’s lips twitched, and he shot her a quick wink, causing her lips to twist to the side to hide a smile. </p><p>“Grasp one another’s right hand.”</p><p>The pair took hands, holding tightly. Hermione reached into her robes with her left hand and pulled out a tiny scroll which was rolled tight and tied with waxed string.</p><p>Dumbledore held his wand to their hands. “You have written your terms out upon this scroll. The Unbreakable Vow cannot be undone until the vow is complete. To break this vow will result in death.”</p><p>Hermione’s heart beat swiftly. Tom’s eyes stayed upon hers, dark and unfathomable, richly saturated with his obsession. </p><p>“There are four parts to your vow. Tom Riddle, will you accept the first term written upon this scroll.”</p><p>He nodded, still gazing at Hermione. “I will. You shall have my loyalty.”</p><p>A tether of light, like a brilliant tongue of flame shot out from Dumbledore’s wand and wound itself around their clasped hands.</p><p>“Will you bend yourself to the second term written upon this scroll, Tom?”</p><p>Again, Tom nodded. “I will.” He squeezed Hermione’s hand, because she began to look faint. “I will protect you and everyone you care about.”</p><p>Hermione’s eyes fell shut and she breathed in deeply to quell her lightheadedness as the second tongue of light wrapped around their hands, intertwining itself with the first.</p><p>“Will you agree, Tom, with the third condition of the vow which is written upon this scroll?” </p><p>Tom breathed her name softly, prompting her to open her eyes. He gave a gentle nod. “I agree to keep your secrets safe, and to protect them at all costs.”</p><p>Dumbledore gazed at the scroll in her hand. “You have a laid down a fourth term, which I’ve been informed applies to the both of you. Will you each agree to the final condition which is written on this scroll?”</p><p>Hermione’s eyes flicked to Tom’s. “Yes,” she said shakily. “I agree to the thing that you’ve asked.”</p><p>Tom swallowed and looked at the scroll, then back at Hermione. “I also agree. You have my word.” His grip tightened on her hand.</p><p>The fourth tongue of flame slid out of Dumbledore’s wand and curled around their hands, entwining itself with the other three.</p><p>The three figures stood silhouetted against the full moon, now permanently bound to each other, whether by magic, or by fate, or by love, or perhaps, by all of the above.</p>

<p>The room was dark and quiet. Rain fell softly beyond the walls of Hermione’s flat.</p><p>When they returned from Dumbledore’s office, Tom and Hermione immediately undressed one another and fell into bed. </p><p>Instead of making love, they hid beneath the covers and they kissed, entirely naked, skin against skin. His arms were wrapped around her, hand snaking up her back to entwine his fingers in her curls.</p><p>Tom savored the feeling of her body against his, the soft curve of her calf as it wrapped around his legs, the velvet smoothness of her skin. His senses were heightened, her scent potent and the feel of her lips divine.</p><p>He slid his tongue against hers and she moaned. He loved the sharp intakes of breath through her nose, the way she dragged her fingertips over the dips and planes of his muscles, how her hands pulled at his hair.</p><p>They kissed and kissed, not a frenzy of lust, but a savoring of sensations, a swapping of energy, each seeking more of the other.</p><p>“Are you afraid?” he asked in a whisper.</p><p>He kissed her throat, leaving a trail of kisses along her collarbone.</p><p>“Yes,” she answered truthfully, her voice quiet and small. </p><p>“Don’t be.” He kissed her. “This will change everything between us… but not in the way that you fear.”</p><p>He hovered above her. She reached up and pulled his face down to hers, kissing him, releasing a desperate whimper from her throat.</p><p>“I love you,” he whispered against her lips. “Merlin’s sake, I love you.”</p><p>He laid his head on her chest, and listened to her heart beating frantically against his ear. </p><p>He stayed like that for a moment. It was hot under the sheet, their breaths and body heat filling the dark cave as they listened to the soft patter of rain on the roof. </p><p>He took her hands and threaded her fingers with his, then lifted them above her head and pinned them there as he kissed her.</p><p>“You’re mine,” Hermione whispered as she came up for air. </p><p>“Yours,” he muttered against her cheek. </p><p>“And… I’m yours,” she said again.</p><p>“Mine,” he answered. </p><p>He shifted to his side and pulled her with him, curling his arms tightly to mold her body against his. “Mine forever… you <em> brilliant </em> witch.”</p><p>“So…” she whispered. “We talk… tomorrow?”</p><p>He nodded, but she couldn’t see in the darkness, so he replied, “Yes, baby. Tomorrow.”</p><p>Her cheeks heated at his use of the endearment. He only seemed to use it in moments like this, when they entered into a moment of connection that was too powerful for words.</p><p>”Shall I tell you… or should I… show you?”</p><p>“That will be up to you.”</p><p>She hid her face against his shoulder. Tom leaned his cheek against her hair, fingers stroking her spine softly.</p><p>Neither of them spoke about what they’d given up.</p><p>That reality no longer existed, and the reality of one another was steadily taking precedence.</p><p>“I’ve wanted this since I kissed you in Godric’s Hollow,” he murmured against her hair.</p><p>“Wanted what?” she asked. “For me to tell you the truth?”</p><p>“No,” he said quietly. “Just this.”</p><p>Hermione was quiet for several moments. </p><p>Then she asked, “What will you do now that you’ve quit your job?”</p><p>“I don’t know yet,” he said as he stroked her arms.</p><p>She laughed softly. “Tom Riddle without a plan… that’s unusual.”</p><p>He smiled. “I do have an idea what I’d like to do, but it all depends.”</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>“You’ll see. No more questions.”</p><p>He pulled her head back by her hair and kissed her.</p><p>“Tom,” she breathed when their lips parted. “Do you want to move in with me?”</p><p>He was quiet for a moment. Then he took a deep breath, ejecting it sharply. “I have gold, Hermione. I can keep my flat.”</p><p>“I- I didn’t mean that, Tom. Forgive me.” She reached up a hand to stroke his cheek. “I just think you’ll be here so often. I mean… I’d like you to be. I don’t want to sleep without you. Unless you don’t want to-“</p><p>“Of course I do.”</p><p>“Then what is the purpose of keeping it?”</p><p>He was silent for a stretch. “Others might see me here. Since you’ll be announcing your campaign, they will likely have your flat watched.”</p><p>“Then let them see.”</p><p>Again, he was silent. He finally broke the silence to ask, “What changed?”</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>“Such a change of heart. I expected to have to drag the truth out of you. And, to be honest… I didn’t expect you to agree to my terms so easily. I’m wondering what’s happened to change your mind.”</p><p>She ran her fingernails through the light hair on his chest. “I don’t know, I just… I think I finally accepted that fate brought us together.”</p><p>He was quiet for a space. “And how do you feel about that?”</p><p>She took a deep breath, then murmured, “I think… I think I feel that I can finally let go and love you the way I want to. The way that you should be loved.”</p><p>His brows furrowed. He said nothing for a while. Then as she began to settle into his arms to sleep, he whispered, “I don’t think I'm deserving of love.” He kissed the top of her head. “But it seems fate has decided to shine favor upon me.”</p><p>——————</p><p>The next morning, on a Wednesday, Hermione stood looking through the window of her flat, a cup of tea in hand. She wore a baby blue robe over her slip of a nightgown, and Tom stood behind her, his arms wrapped around her middle.</p><p>He pulled her hair back over her shoulder. Her robe had slightly slipped away, revealing smooth, tanned skin. He pressed his lips to the curve of her shoulder. </p><p>“I suppose I should start with… when you first appeared,” Hermione murmured softly. </p><p>“No.” Tom shook his head. </p><p>“No?”</p><p>“Show me your childhood. I want to see how you grew up.”</p><p>Hermione blinked. “Alright.”</p><p>She turned in his arms.</p><p>They gazed at one another for several moments, before he lifted his hands and laid them on either side of her face, threading his fingers into the hair framing her face.</p><p>He smiled softly, then whispered, “Legilimens.”</p><p>His entry into her mind was softer than a kiss, like the blowing of a gentle breeze. </p><p>She first showed him her parents, Bill and Helen. He rifled through her memories as if he were flipping the pages of a storybook. He saw her childhood home, her parents’ occupation, witnessed a young Hermione listening to her parents’ cassette tapes on a walkman. He observed her childhood bedroom all decorated with cerulean blue and purple flowers, the bookcase full of books she read as a child. He witnessed the consecutive holidays of her youth, summer vacation’s with her parents to the ocean, and then finally, her first instance of magic. Hermione could feel his amusement, something almost akin to pride as he watched her at the age of six, her thick curls dripping with the salty ocean spray, wearing a lime green and blue bathing suit.</p><p>“Mom!” she yelled to her parents, who were swimming nearby. </p><p>Hermione held up a little sphere of water, which floated above her palm. The water contained itself to a little orb, rolling and spitting droplets here and there.</p><p>Tom’s amusement heightened as he witnessed her parents’ reaction, their astonished eyes and exchanged looks.</p><p>He searched through her memories and settled on another. Hermione was hunched in a dark hallway, eavesdropping on her parents in the living room of their rather luxurious home. Her parents presumably thought she was asleep.</p><p>“Honey, we’ve always known she was special. She was reading at four years old! Read the entire Canterbury Tales in a day!”</p><p>“But what <em> is </em> this? How is she able to do these things, Bill? It’s frightening.”</p><p>There was a pause. “I- I don’t know. She has abilities. It’s almost like magic.”</p><p>Her mother scoffed. “Right. <em> Magic </em>.”</p><p>“Well, what else would you call it?”</p><p>Another pause. “I don’t know.”</p><p>Hermione could feel her shame and fear in the memory as if it were yesterday. She could sense Tom tuning into her emotions.</p><p>“It’s really a blessing, if you think about it, Helen,” came the warm, deep voice of her father. “She’s extraordinary… and she’s our daughter. We have to do our best to protect her, to help her. She’s so young, Helen.”</p><p>“I know. I <em> know </em> . It’s just… <em> scary </em>. There’s no owner’s manual for this.”</p><p>Her father chuckled, followed by the soft tinkling laughter of her mother. </p><p>Tom pulled out of the memory and moved on, exploring her time at primary school. To Hermione’s slight embarrassment, he witnessed her unpopularity, the way the other children shunned her, teased her about her hair, calling her a know-it-all. He felt her every emotion, her feelings of isolation, of being different, her loneliness.</p><p>Finally, he reached the moment she received her Hogwarts letter. Hermione received a personal visit from Professor McGonnagal. Hermione could feel Tom’s surprise at the memory, but she couldn’t decipher what had triggered it.</p><p>He watched as Bill and Helen asked Minerva to take a photograph of them using a small disposable camera. </p><p>Minerva balked, stating that she had no idea how to operate the muggle contraption, and Hermione could feel his silent laughter as they explained to her how the camera worked.</p><p>Hermione stood between her parents, holding up the letter with a brilliant smile as Professor McGonnagall snapped the photograph.</p><p>Then, Tom pulled out of her mind.</p><p>Hermione bit her lip as she gazed back at Tom. She waited for the headache that would surely come, but to her surprise, she felt nothing.</p><p>“So Minerva is good enough to teach, but I’m not,” he said sourly.</p><p>Hermione fought back laughter. “That’s all you have to say!”</p><p>“No, I have other things to say. But that, my dear, is entirely mental. From what I recall, she didn’t even fare so well on her NEWTS.”</p><p>“Well, not everyone can be you, Tom. She was actually an excellent transfiguration teacher. My favorite, in fact.” She rubbed her lips together as she dragged a fingernail along his jawline. “Besides, you were sort of… a <em> Dark Lord </em>.”</p><p>He laughed, pulling her closer. “Perhaps, if Dippet had hired me, I wouldn’t have been.”</p><p>She cocked an eyebrow, eliciting a grin from Tom.</p><p>“Perhaps I would’ve,” he conceded. “It seems you had quite a lovely childhood, little witch, despite the other muggle children. I also wasn’t very popular with my peers as a child.” His eyes cut to hers. “For different reasons, but… same outcome.”</p><p>She rolled her eyes. “Ah, yes… the <em> rabbit </em>.”</p><p>He cocked his head and lifted an eyebrow. “You know about that?”</p><p>“Unfortunately.”</p><p>He chuckled.</p><p>“You were also a thief, if I recall correctly.”</p><p>He ran his tongue along his incisors, the corner of his lips tugging upward slightly. “I still am. Some habits die hard.”</p><p>She gave him a disapproving glare, and he smirked. “I’ll attempt to curb my bad habits. For you, Mrs. Riddle.”</p><p>Hermione’s heart leapt against her will.</p><p>He leaned forward with a leer. “I can feel your excitement when I call you that.”</p><p>“No you can’t.”</p><p>He nodded, eyes narrowing. “Oh, I definitely can. You can’t help it.”</p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes.</p><p>“Tell me, what size is it?”</p><p>Hermione’s brow furrowed. “What?”</p><p>“Your brain. You roll your eyes so much, you should be able to see it.”</p><p>Hermione’s mouth fell open, then she burst into laughter. “Did you, Tom Marvolo Riddle, just make a dad joke?” </p><p>He shook his head in perturbation as he watched her gasping for air.</p><p>“If you choke to death of your <em> cackling </em> laughter, I’m not going to heal you.”</p><p>When her laughter subsided, she looked back at him, fighting back a smile.</p><p>He reached up and took her chin between his thumb and forefinger, tilting her head up as he leaned in and pressed his lips to hers. </p><p>He kissed her gently for a moment, then leaned back to whisper, “Look at you, Dumbledore. You’ve gone from the outcast, to the “it” girl of magical Britain. It’s almost as if you were always meant to be here… with me.” His black eyes sparkled like faceted onyx. “Soon to be Minister for Magic.”</p><p>“What if you win?”</p><p>His lips turned up in a devilish smirk. “Then you can shock all of the portraits by sucking my cock in my office.”</p><p>Hermione giggled, and Tom reveled in the feeling of the walls between them slowly disintegrating.</p><p>“Do you miss them?”</p><p>She glanced at him questioningly. “My parents?”</p><p>He nodded. </p><p>She lowered her eyes. “Yes. Terribly.”</p><p>He watched her with curiosity, then reached up to touch her cheek. “I don’t know what that feels like, little witch… but I’m sorry.”</p><p>She wrapped her arms around his neck and buried her face against his chest, releasing a trembling sigh. “This is going to be very difficult.”</p><p>“But necessary.”</p><p>She nodded. “Yes.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>After lunch, Hermione apparated to the factory to check on its progress. She looked over the next morning’s edition of <em>The</em> <em>Chronomancer</em> and was overjoyed when Eulessia Baron reported the success of the first week’s papers. Hermione personally greeted all of the newly hired columnists and copywriters, then stopped in to say hello to Winnie Haywood.</p><p>Before she left, she informed Eulessia of her decision to resign from the DMLE, and her imminent run for Minister.</p><p>“<em> Merlin </em> , Hermione! Minister for Magic! Witch Weekly really did predict it, didn’t they? I’ll get started on a headline piece for <em> The Chronomancer </em> right away!”</p><p>Once she was fully assured that her presence wasn’t needed, she apparated back to Horizont Alley and stopped to purchase ingredients to cook for dinner. She picked up the items she would need to bake scones, though she decided that she would have Tom make them, as his were <em> annoyingly </em> better than hers.</p><p>Tom wasn’t there when she returned, so she got started on dinner. Piksy, however, tried to push Hermione aside, quite frustrated at her employer’s decision to cook without her.</p><p>Hermione sent her away for the evening, much to Piksy’s begrudgery.</p><p>Dinner was almost finished when Tom returned.</p><p>They ate out on her balcony, seated at a wrought iron table. The evening was balmy, with the currents of summer beginning to blow in on the breeze. Tom waved his hand, lighting the candle in the center of the table.</p><p>“Where did you go today?” she asked.</p><p>“I’ll tell you soon.”</p><p>“You and your secrets.”</p><p>“I don’t think you’re one to accuse anyone of secrets.”</p><p>Hermione twisted her lips to the side. “True. But I’ve had good reasons to keep them.” </p><p>“And so have I.”</p><p>She took a deep breath. “Alright then. Keep them.” She took a sip of her wine. “Well, I suppose I should tell you this part, since I can’t show you. I wasn’t alive to see it.”</p><p>His eyes flicked to her. They were sharp, and she almost detected a bit of nervousness in them.</p><p>“You rose to power in the 70s and 80s. You killed and tortured a lot of people, Tom.”</p><p>He blinked, his face a blank mask.</p><p>She cleared her throat. “There was a prophecy that reached your ears. About a baby who would be your undoing, born to two people who refused to join your ranks.”</p><p>He gazed back at her stoically, listening.</p><p>“You began to hunt them down. Someone who should’ve been their friend betrayed them. You found them and killed them.” She swallowed. “Everything you did only served to fulfill the prophecy. The boy’s mother sacrificed herself to protect him and it created a… <em> sacrificial </em> magic, which destroyed you… when you tried to kill the baby.”</p><p>His lips parted. He was quiet for several moments, then he murmured, “Go on.”</p><p>She took a deep breath. “You were gone. The entire wizarding world celebrated. The evil dark lord was defeated. The boy became a celebrity, a symbol of hope. A symbol of the light winning over darkness.”</p><p>They stopped eating. He ran his fingertips around the rim of his glass of firewhiskey, deep in thought.</p><p>“Twelve years went by. I found myself on the train to Hogwarts for my first year. I met the boy on the train. His name was Harry. We became best friends.”</p><p>“Harry,” he said. “The boy in your photograph.”</p><p>Her eyebrows furrowed. “What photograph?”</p><p>He ran his tongue over his top teeth, then reached out to take her hand. He turned his head, his black eyes meeting hers. “Look into my mind, Hermione.”</p><p>She let him take her hand, and then she whispered, “Legilimens.”</p><p>His obsidian mental walls melted away as he permitted her into his mind. </p><p>A scene unfolded before her. Tom was inside her flat, gazing at a photograph which lay on her bed. The moving image depicted herself seated between Ron and Harry on the floor of the Gryffindor common room.</p><p><em> So this is how you found out, </em>she thought with chagrin.</p><p>He said nothing.</p><p>As the scene unfolded, her shock mounted as he discovered her in her shower. Her skin was so cold. She watched as Tom began to panic, lifting her from the shower and placing her in bed. It was a peculiar feeling to see herself on the verge of unconsciousness, to see herself from Tom’s perspective as he searched frantically for poison antidote in her stores. </p><p>She felt Tom’s rage in the memory, rage at her stupidity, his anger boiling over at her lies.</p><p>When his panic began to dissipate, seeing her breathing begin to regulate, he pushed her out of the memory.</p><p>Hermione retreated from his mind and once again sat staring at Tom. </p><p>“I- I thought that night was just a dream. You were really there.”</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>“That’s the night I overdosed. The night you told me about.”</p><p>Again, he nodded.</p><p>Her head dropped, and she stared at her hands in her lap. “I’m sorry, Tom.”</p><p>He shook his head and shrugged. “I’m sure I’ve put you through far worse. For everything I suspect you’ve endured, it’s quite understandable.” He cut his eyes to her. “Sleeping with the enemy. You certainly are a rebel, aren’t you, little witch?”</p><p>She rubbed her lips together to keep from smiling. </p><p>“So, why don’t you show me your first year at Hogwarts?”</p><p>“Are you not going to show me your childhood? What about the soulmate potion?”</p><p>“All in good time. We are starting with you.”</p><p>She breathed a tremulous breath, then nodded. Their eyes met, and she heard his voice, speaking to her in her mind as she had at the funeral.</p><p>
<em> I love you. </em>
</p><p>She gazed at him, biting her lip as she found herself unable to hide the lovestruck gleam in her eyes.</p><p>“Legilimens,” he whispered.</p><p> </p><hr/><p><br/>
“So,” she said as he withdrew from her mind. “You possessed my teacher, drank unicorn blood, and fought a twelve-year-old for the sorcerer’s stone.”</p><p>“Right,” he said wryly.</p><p>“Which brings me to my next confession.”</p><p>He cocked an eyebrow, leaning back in his seat as he looked back at her questioningly.</p><p>She stood from the table and went back into the flat. A few minutes later she returned, tossing a makeshift journal bearing his name on the table.</p><p>“Where is the real horcrux?”</p><p>Tom’s eyebrows shot up. His Adam’s apple bobbed, then he cut his eyes back to her to find her regarding him with a withering glare.</p><p>“It’s at my flat.”</p><p>“So it was <em> you </em> I was talking to, after all.”</p><p>His lips turned up at the corners. “Yes.”</p><p>She huffed. “Why the fake?”</p><p>He stared at the journal for a moment. “I suppose… I wanted to talk to you.”</p><p>“Typical,” she muttered murderously. “You could’ve just stopped by. Instead, you had to hatch an elaborate plan that involved lies, <em> Malfoy </em>, and props!” She held up the journal and then threw it down. </p><p>He chuckled. “To be clear, there were no lies involved. You simply happened upon my journal… only it was a fake. I wanted to know if you would recognize my journal if you saw it. The mere fact that you took it at all answered my question.” He rubbed his chin thoughtfully. “I am wondering how you knew it was fake.”</p><p>“I’m not daft, Tom! I know you wouldn’t leave one of your horcruxes laying around in plain sight in the Malfoy library. Besides, It doesn’t <em> feel </em> like one of your horcruxes.”</p><p>He looked surprised. “You… know how they feel?”</p><p>“I know what your magic feels like. I wore one of your horcruxes around my neck for months.” Their eyes met. “It tormented me.”</p><p>Their eyes were locked in a searing connection for several moments.</p><p>“Now you torment me for different reasons,” she said quietly.</p><p>Silence fell for a beat. </p><p>Finally, he broke the silence. “What horcrux are you referring to? The one you wore?”</p><p>“One that will never be made.”</p><p>“Fair enough,” he conceded. “So when you wrote in the journal, you suspected it was me.”</p><p>“Yes,” she sighed. “I was angry. Angry at you for trying to trick me. Angry at you for everything you’d put me through. Angry that you hadn’t said a word to me since… since we stopped speaking.” Her gaze fell to her hands in her lap. “Angry that I missed you.”</p><p>Tom gazed at her for a while in silence. Night had fallen, leaving only the glow of the candle between them to light their faces. All was quiet, save the sound of Perdita hooing on her perch.</p><p>Tom reached out and took Hermione’s hand, lifting it to bring her fingertips to his lips. He kissed them softly, then threaded his fingers with hers. “Why did you leave the book about Dumbledore?”</p><p>Her mouth fell slightly ajar. For a moment she seemed at a loss for words, and then she whispered, as if shocked at herself, “I suppose I hoped that if you did find it, it might make you see him in a different light.”</p><p>“Why would you want that?” His question drew her gaze, so he continued, “If you didn’t want to see me anymore, then why?”</p><p>She bit her lip, then whispered, “I think it’s clear now that I did want to see you again.” </p><p>He pressed his tongue against the inside of his cheek. “You really want me to reconcile with Dumbledore, don’t you?”</p><p>“He’s all I have, Tom.”</p><p>“Not true.”</p><p>Her expression became entreating. “Please.”</p><p>His thumb rubbed absently against the back of her hand; he heaved a deep breath. “I don’t think there’s anything you could ask of me that I would deny you, Hermione.”</p><p>He said it quietly, but there was a measure of defeat in the statement, as if he’d at last discovered the limits of himself.</p><p>“One thing I’d like to point out,” he continued, “Is that if you wanted me to see Dumbledore in a better light, that certainly wasn’t the right book to use. Whoever wrote it was clearly biased against him.”</p><p>Hermione huffed and rolled her eyes, sitting back and crossing her arms. “Rita <em> fucking </em> Skeeter! I despise her. That woman is absolutely barmy and has no code of ethics <em> whatsoever </em>.”</p><p>“That’s one of the strongest reactions I’ve witnessed from you, little witch.”</p><p>“Yes, well, if it weren’t for you, I’d say she was the bane of my existence… she’s perhaps a close second.”</p><p>“You still think I’m the bane of your existence?”</p><p>She flicked her eyes to him as she sipped her wine. Her warm brown eyes sparkled with humor. “Remains to be seen.”</p><p>“You still don’t trust me?”</p><p>“I’m sure you’ll see why very soon.”</p><p>He nodded. “So what did this Rita Skeeter do to you?”</p><p>Hermione’s mouth twisted into a scowl instantly. “She wrote and published lies about me in The Daily Prophet… when I was only a child. She’s a disgusting excuse for a reporter. It’s alright though, I did trap her in a jar for the better part of a year.”</p><p>Tom’s eyebrows rose sharply. “You did <em> what </em>?”</p><p>Hermione rubbed her lips together. “I discovered that she was an animagus. That’s how she kept getting her stories. She would transform into a beetle and spy on people. So I trapped her in a jar. She deserved every minute of it.”</p><p>Tom grinned, running his tongue over the edge of his top teeth. “The more I get to know you, the more I’m convinced we are soulmates… potion aside.”</p><p>“Please tell me what the devil this soulmate potion is about? Please, Tom!”</p><p>He cleared his throat, then withdrew his cigarettes from his inner coat pocket. He lit one wandlessly and ejected the smoke. “Have you ever heard of a potion called The Tears of Adonis?”</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>“Neither had I. Apparently, according to ancient lore, wizards were once whole beings… with immense magical power. To stop them from being too powerful, Zeus severed them into two parts, so that they would continually long for their other half. Essentially, one would be continually reincarnated until one’s soul could be reunited with its other half. There is a book that details the anatomy of the soul and the magical core. That book also mentions a potion which can reveal two soulmates.”</p><p>“And you brewed it?”</p><p>“I did.”</p><p>She swallowed. Her heart began to pound rapidly. “With Slughorn?”</p><p>He nodded. “It took us three months.” He lifted the cigarette to his lips, sucking in another drag. “If the potion turned blue, you were my soulmate. Red, and you weren’t.”</p><p>Hermione’s lips parted. “I’m assuming that it turned blue, or you wouldn’t be here right now.”</p><p>He shook his head. “Oh no, little witch. I would absolutely be here. I didn’t actually believe the whole nonsense… not until the potion turned blue.”</p><p>Hermione released a shaky breath, then whispered, “So it did turn blue...”</p><p>He nodded once. “It did.”</p><p>“And you have this potion?”</p><p>“It’s in my flat.”</p><p>She swallowed. “What happens then? Do you drink it?”</p><p>He chuckled. “No, love. There is a rite that must be performed to stitch our souls together.”</p><p>Her mouth fell open, eyes wide. “We… <em> stitch our souls </em>?”</p><p>The candlelight danced in his onyx eyes. “Apparently, it would make us one in every way, and our magical power would be amplified.”</p><p>Her eyebrows shot up. “Amplified? Is that the reason you brewed the potion?”</p><p>He gave her a look of reproval. “Do you think that's the only reason?”</p><p>She gazed back at him for a moment, then drew in a deep breath. “This is a lot to take in.”</p><p>He nodded in silence.</p><p>After a minute, he stood, then held out his hand to help her up. “I think we’ve accomplished enough for one night. I’ll bring the book to you so that you can examine it for yourself. I transfigured a copy since the original is spelled to the Malfoy Library.”</p><p>She took his hand and stood, allowing him to slip his arms around her waist. “So will we continue this tomorrow?”</p><p>“Yes, little witch.”</p><p>“What will we do for the rest of tonight?”</p><p>His lips curled into a devious smirk, and he leaned forward to whisper in her ear.</p><p>Hermione’s laughter rang out through the night.</p>

<p>“So we meet again, Tom. Please… have a seat.”</p><p>Dumbledore held out his hand in a gesture for Tom to sit. </p><p>Tom stared at the older wizard for a moment before taking the seat in front of the Headmaster’s desk.</p><p>Seraphina preened on her perch, cawing at Tom as she bowed her head, expecting his attention.</p><p>Tom furrowed his brows as he gazed at the bird, unsure what he had done to warrant her affection. </p><p>Dumbledore folded his hands on his desk, chuckling as he noted the phoenix’s behavior.</p><p>“I do believe you’ve made a friend for life.”</p><p>“I’ve no idea why.”</p><p>“If I may hazard a guess, I would imagine it has something to do with your closeness to my daughter.”</p><p>Tom was uncomfortable. He sat back in his chair, attempting to make himself feel a bit less awkward about the task at hand. “Ah… perhaps so, Headmaster.”</p><p>Dumbledore stroked his auburn beard pensively. “My daughter had mentioned her desire for us to all have tea together… but you have requested this meeting to be private. Why?”</p><p>Tom willed his features to be void of expression. He didn’t trust the wizard in front of him, but that was a nonissue. </p><p>Tom didn’t trust anyone.</p><p>“I’m sure you’re aware that Hermione and I are… involved.”</p><p>Dumbledore nodded, then waved his wand. A little tin box levitated out of his desk drawer and toward Tom. “Sugar quill?”</p><p>Tom stared at the box as if it were an offender, then flicked his eyes back to Albus. “No, thank you, sir.”</p><p>Dumbledore nodded with a smile and the box lowered to his desk. “Perhaps some brandy instead? I’ve a feeling this discussion will require a drink.”</p><p>Tom was becoming more and more uncomfortable. He cleared his throat. “Firewhiskey, if you have it.”</p><p>Dumbledore tutted and waved his wand again. A cabinet opened on the other side of his office and two drinks began to pour themselves. “You young men always prefer liquor that tastes like cauldron polish.”</p><p>Tom’s lips twitched.</p><p>“I'm inclined to believe that every time you drink it, it takes a month off of your life. Bear that in mind, Tom.”</p><p>“I shall take that into consideration, sir.”</p><p><em> It wouldn’t be an issue even if it were true </em>, Tom thought. He was careful not to focus on his horcruxes, as he still feared the older wizard’s powers of legilimency.</p><p>He was a natural, much like Tom.</p><p>Dumbledore levitated the pair of glasses, one, a deep burgundy crystal, and the other, the color of an emerald. Tom took the green one with a tipping of his head.</p><p>“Thank you, sir.”</p><p>Dumbledore gave a thin smile as he took the burgundy class and they toasted the air, each taking a sip, their eyes locked on one another.</p><p>Dumbledore sat back, smacking his lips. “To what do I owe this visit, Mr. Riddle?”</p><p>Tom reached into the pocket of his robes and withdrew two objects, which he promptly set on the edge of Dumbledore’s desk.</p><p>The headmaster leaned forward, eyeing the objects.</p><p>The first was a tiny velvet box bearing an emerald ring. The second, was a glass vial full of an azure-colored potion.</p><p>Albus said nothing, but merely flicked his blue eyes to Tom with a quirk of his brow.</p><p>“I would like to ask Hermione to marry me.”</p><p>Dumbledore was still for a moment. </p><p>The office was eerily quiet, save for the whizzing and whirling of magical instruments upon their pedestals.</p><p>Dumbledore reached out and took the delicate box between his fingers.</p><p>“The ouroboros,” he said softly. “Do you know what it represents, Tom?”</p><p>“Eternity.”</p><p>Dumbledore blinked, then he smiled. “Not quite. It represents the eternal cycle of death and rebirth.”</p><p>Their eyes met. </p><p>“Perhaps your choice of ring is prophetic in some way.”</p><p>Tom said nothing in response.</p><p>Dumbledore cleared his throat. “I suppose you’ve come to ask my permission.”</p><p>Tom nodded once. “That is the purpose of my visit.”</p><p>Albus contemplated Tom for a moment. “Let me ask you this, Tom. Do you love my daughter?”</p><p>“I do.”</p><p>“And I assume she has entrusted some, if not all, of her secrets to you?”</p><p>“She has.”</p><p>Dumbledore nodded, rubbing his beard thoughtfully.</p><p>“Then you’ll know she’s not my daughter.”</p><p>Tom took a deep breath, then cut his eyes over to the two phoenixes which sat upon the perch. “She has her Phoenix… It seems fate has decided she is a Dumbledore.”</p><p>Dumbledore nodded again. “Quite right. Fate, it seems, is playing a strange hand in her life… and consequently, ours as well.”</p><p>“Have you heard of The Tears of Adonis, Headmaster?”</p><p>Dumbledore’s blue eyes found Tom and sharpened perceptibly. “Oh, yes. I studied its properties during my alchemical studies in Germany during my younger years.”</p><p>“Then you know its function.”</p><p>“Indubitably.”</p><p>As if on cue, both their eyes fell upon the potion simultaneously. It shone with glowing effervescence as it sat upon the desk.</p><p>“Am I to believe this is a correctly brewed vial of that very potion, Tom?”</p><p>Riddle nodded. “Yes, sir. Professor Slughorn helped me to brew it.”</p><p>Dumbledore reached out and took hold of the vial. He held it up to the light, admiring its luminosity and color. </p><p>“Remarkable. A rather difficult potion to brew, I daresay.”</p><p>Tom’s eyes flicked to Albus’ and suddenly, they were no longer a pair of guarded potential enemies, but two scholars, marveling at a magical anomaly. </p><p>“How wonderful, Tom, to have attempted and mastered a rare potion such as this. I’m assuming that this potion bears tears belonging to yourself and my daughter.”</p><p>Tom inclined his head in answer.</p><p>Dumbledore raised his eyebrows.</p><p>Tom cleared his throat. “Yes, Headmaster.”</p><p>His former professor set the potion down and sat back in his chair, crossing his legs one over the other. He stroked his silver-flecked auburn beard, gazing at Tom through his spectacles. </p><p>Tom returned the look stoically. </p><p>He couldn’t help but feel a small twinge of pride at the older wizard’s praise of the potion.</p><p>Tom pushed it down in disgust.</p><p>He had admired Dumbledore immensely at one point in his life.</p><p>Secretly, Tom still considered him to be the only wizard worthy of his respect. Tom had not yet discovered a difference between fear and respect.</p><p>The only people he’d ever respected, he’d also feared.</p><p>He’d always hoped that one day, the world might fear him also.</p><p>Dumbledore’s lips turned up at the corners. “How fascinating.”</p><p>Seraphina cawed and cooed, her black eyes settled on Tom.</p><p>“Do I have your approval, Headmaster?”</p><p>Dumbledore chuckled. “We both know that you don’t want or need my approval.” He took another sip of brandy. “However, you are here for Hermione’s sake, and that is something that I admire. Of course, you may have it. Who am I to stand in the way of two soulmates? I’m thoroughly enjoying the process of watching fate play its hand, although I’ll be honest, you didn’t need to bring the potion, Tom. As long as you treat Hermione the way she deserves to be treated, you will have no quarrel with me.” His eyes flicked down to the ring on his desk. He looked back up at Tom with a barely concealed smile. “I must commend you on the ring, by the way. It is very beautiful. However, her house colors are red, not green.”</p><p>Tom smirked and looked down at the ring. “In the wizarding world I’m sure you know that it is customary for a witch to wear the house colors of her husband.”</p><p>Dumbledore nodded. “That is true. However, as I’m sure you’ve noticed… Hermione is no ordinary witch.”</p><p>Tom gave a wry smile. “No. She isn’t.”</p><p>“Besides, Tom. I’m sure you’re aware by now that she is muggleborn. She may have customs of her own to observe, particularly in the ceremony.” He tilted his head down slightly to look pointedly at Tom over his spectacles. “I trust there won’t be an issue with that?”</p><p>Tom shook his head slowly. “No.”</p><p>Dumbledore finished off his brandy with a satisfied smacking of his lips and then reached out his hand to Tom. “If Hermione chooses you, that’s good enough for me. You will be very welcome in the Dumbledore family, Tom.” Tom stared at his hand in shock for a moment, before hesitantly taking his hand. Once Albus gripped his hand, he pulled Tom closer. “Provided you take care of her and do not put her in harm’s way. My daughter’s safety comes first and foremost, before any of your career goals.”</p><p>“Of course,” Tom said seriously.</p><p>Dumbledore released him.</p><p>Tom ran his tongue over his top teeth. “That brings me to my next request.”</p><p>“Oh? What might that be, Tom?”</p><p>Tom cleared his throat. “I applied for the Defense Against the Dark Arts position a few years ago when I graduated, but Headmaster Dippet considered me too young to teach. I’d like to request that you reconsider me for the post.”</p><p>Dumbledore cocked an eyebrow. “Are you not currently running for office?”</p><p>Tom sat back in his chair. “I think we both know who will be Minister, Headmaster.”</p><p>Dumbledore hummed and narrowed his eyes thoughtfully as he scratched his chin. “We already have a teacher, Tom.”</p><p>“Not a single student scored an Outstanding on their NEWTs in Defense last term. Even the OWLs were abysmal.”</p><p>Dumbledore blinked, then inclined his head in agreement.</p><p>The two wizards sat in silence, taking stock of one another.</p><p>Dumbledore’s watch rang off with the sound of the Hogwarts Express. He withdrew it from his robe pocket and silenced it. He put it away, then folded his hands on the desk as he gazed at Tom. He opened his mouth to speak, but Tom beat him to it.</p><p>“You know that I am more than qualified, sir.”</p><p>Dumbledore nodded. “Certainly too qualified to work at an antiques shop reputed for its ties to dark magic.”</p><p>“I’ve learned <em> invaluable </em> information working there.”</p><p>“You’ve learned things that should never be taught at Hogwarts.”</p><p>Silence stretched between them.</p><p>Tom’s jaw tensed. “I agree. But how can one teach defense against something one has no knowledge of in the first place?”</p><p>Dumbledore exhaled, peering at his former student thoughtfully. Then he sat forward suddenly, his blue eyes penetrating Tom’s with a sharpness that alarmed his former student. The older wizard’s magical agility sliced right through Tom’s defenses, baring his mind for the briefest moment as Dumbledore used his gift of legilimency to glean Tom’s intent.</p><p>Then just as quickly, he sat back, releasing his hold on Tom’s mind.</p><p>Tom schooled his face to stay blank, but inside he was furious, even somewhat caught off guard.</p><p>“Tom, if you marry Hermione, your loyalties will lie with her. Your entire set of priorities will shift. They <em> must </em>.”</p><p>“You just looked into my mind. You should know that they already have.”</p><p>Dumbledore toyed with his wand. “I had to be sure you weren’t attempting to use her for your own ends.” Albus turned his wand over slowly, considering. “Hogwarts is not a recruitment center, Tom.”</p><p>Tom sipped his firewhiskey. “Understood.”</p><p>“Your curriculum will be approved by me. You will run everything you plan to teach by myself or another tenured instructor.”</p><p>Tom blinked. “Of course.”</p><p>“In fact,” Dumbledore continued, twisting his wand in his fingers. “The Ministry of Magic has recently passed a law requiring me to present the teaching material of school educators to the ministry, to be looked over by the Minister.”</p><p>Tom’s lips quirked. “Which will be my wife.”</p><p>Dumbledore tilted his head. “Potentially.” He took another drink of brandy. “However… this school, its hiring, firing, and all of its affairs, including the curriculum, is decided by the Headmaster… which is, of course, myself.”</p><p>Tom shifted in his seat, feeling very much like the orphan boy he’d been when Dumbledore first came to visit him and set his wardrobe on fire. “I hope you know that I’m not asking for favoritism, sir… only to be assessed fairly for my knowledge and skills, and to be… given an opportunity.”</p><p>“An opportunity.” Dumbledore chuckled softly. “You know, I was recently berated by my daughter where you’re concerned.”</p><p>“Sounds like her.”</p><p>“Yes, well… she said the very same thing. That I never gave you a chance. An <em> opportunity </em>.” He circled his fingertip around the rim of the burgundy glass. “Perhaps we both are being given another chance, Tom.”</p><p>Dumbledore took a deep breath, then turned to gaze at the pair of phoenixes seated on their perch. </p><p>“One year, Tom. You’ll start when term begins in the fall.” </p><p>—————-</p><p> </p><p>Tom Riddle ran his hand through the shining locks of his pitch black hair. He’d been trimming it shorter of late, but it had grown out in recent weeks, and he hadn’t slicked it back this morning, so a wayward curl fell across his forehead.</p><p>In his other hand, he held a pipe filled with Veela leaves. “Have you ever smoked these, Hermione?”</p><p>“They’re banned in the future.”</p><p>“Is that so? Then you’d better enjoy them while you can.”</p><p>“Between that and your cigarettes, you’ll likely be reincarnating yourself through a horcrux sooner rather than later.”</p><p>He laughed, and she admired the way his sculpted cheeks drew back in charming folds to bare his perfectly white teeth.</p><p>“My parents would’ve loved your teeth.”</p><p>He smirked as he held out the pipe to Hermione. “Would they have liked me, do you think?”</p><p>“Considering who you are, probably not.”</p><p>“That’s fair. I suppose I’ll have to impress Dumbledore then, to stay in your good graces.”</p><p>Hermione fidgeted with the Phoenix necklace around her neck.</p><p>“So,” he began, returning to their prior topic of conversation. “Your friend killed my basilisk.”</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>“I possessed your other friend’s sister and tried to kill her.”</p><p>“Unfortunately… and I’m also not happy with what you did to Hagrid.”</p><p>He shrugged, smoke pouring from between his lips.</p><p>“The basilisk is dead now.”</p><p>Hermione cocked her head, brows furrowed. “Yes, I know. I just said that.”</p><p>“No, Hermione. I mean that I killed it.”</p><p>“What do you mean, you killed it?”</p><p>“I. Drove. A. <em> Dagger </em> . Through. Its. <em> Skull </em>.” He enunciated each word in a condescending way, which would’ve irritated her if she wasn’t so shocked by his statement.</p><p>Hermione blinked in stunned silence. “When? And… and <em> why </em>?”</p><p>He shrugged. “When Slughorn and I were brewing the potion some months back.”</p><p>“But why?”</p><p>His eyes flicked to hers. “Are you that thick, little witch? Why in Salazar’s name do you think I would do such a thing?”</p><p>Hermione eyed him dubiously as she put the pipe in her mouth and sucked in the smoke. The dark purple leaves in the bowl flickered with a bright flame and she coughed as the smoke came up. </p><p>Tom grinned and clapped her on the back. “Dumbledore caught me in the hall that day. Threatened to chop me into a million pieces if I ever harmed you.”</p><p>Though she was preoccupied with coughing up a lung, she glared at him out of the corner of her eye. “I doubt that happened,” she choked.</p><p>“Oh, but it did. I suppose I should’ve been offended, but I couldn't help but be a bit relieved that he and I finally have a common interest.”</p><p>Hermione cocked a brow. “What would that be?”</p><p>His lips twitched and he leaned toward her, reams of light dancing off her hair and her skin and her lashes as he gazed at her through a magically induced euphoria. “We both want to keep you safe.”</p><p>Calm washed over Hermione almost instantly, the effects of the pipe quickly working on her consciousness. Her vision clouded, everything in her flat tinged with beauty and suddenly seemed to sparkle. “Why does it look as if everything is made of glass?”</p><p>Tom swallowed, forgetting to answer her entirely as he watched her. His eyes honed in on the frizzy ringlets of her hair, thinking to himself how perfect she looked, how he’d never realized until now how his eyes were always drawn without fail to the slim curve of her calf, thinking to himself how rich the color of her skin was, how vivacious and saturated with warmth it appeared. He noticed the way her forehead crinkled when she was in thought, a sure sign of a forthcoming epiphany. Those moments were his favorite, because he loved to hear her thoughts, her theories and conjectures.</p><p>He noted to himself that her eyes were the color of autumn, and they gave him the exact same feeling as the first frost of fall. He watched as those eyes combed the room, taking in its phosphorescent appearance, triggered by the pipe. “I’m hallucinating,” she whispered.</p><p>He said nothing, but merely watched her with a smile, absorbing her every movement like a predator. He felt a wave of feeling, as if every emotion he’d ever felt for her were coming up like a tidal wave in his inebriated state. Heat radiated through his body.</p><p>Tom had only once felt that he was dreaming, on the day that Dumbledore had visited him in Wool’s Orphanage. Tom had felt that somehow he’d died and been sent to some alternate reality. The existence of magic? After all his years wasting away in the misery of a muggle orphanage, in the midst of war? It couldn’t be.</p><p>He hadn’t really considered the possibility that there could be others out there in the world just like him.</p><p>It seemed too good to be true.</p><p>He had felt a small part of himself click into place that day, like a piece of the puzzle that had been missing. </p><p>Still, another part of him had been devastatingly empty, made even more obvious by the rest of his life which seemed to be improving. Some part of Tom had been stuck, hollow, a stark comparison with the rest of him which seemed to be able to do no wrong.</p><p>He’d been powerful, sharp, cunning, handsome, and eventually, popular.</p><p>So why had he always felt… off?</p><p>As if his entire life were a little too far to the left or right. As if he’d lived his entire life with a pebble in his shoe.</p><p>He’d thought that perhaps the absence of his mother and father had left such a void within him; he overcompensated by driving himself to perfection in his schoolwork.</p><p>But no matter what he did, he’d always felt… <em> fractured </em>.</p><p>It was as if his soul had already been split from the womb.</p><p>Tom stared at Hermione, watching the little rainbow-tinted lights dance along her skin, and it struck him that she did indeed resemble a goddess. </p><p>“I’ve never felt full until I met you, Hermione.”</p><p>His voice was low, almost a whisper.</p><p>Hermione blinked, her reaction delayed as her eyes slowly found Tom. They roamed his face and body first before she replied, “Full?”</p><p>“That’s the only word I know to describe the feeling.”</p><p>She sidled closer, then hitched her leg around his waist to straddle him. His eyes narrowed as they slid over her body. </p><p>“Do you mean to say… that I complete you?”</p><p>His eyes met hers. “That’s a better way of putting it, I suppose.”</p><p>She wrapped her arms around his neck. Already she began to grind her hips against his, the potency of the Veela leaves already beginning to work their magic upon her. Her mouth met his neck, and she swiped her tongue along his skin to trace his jugular vein. “Tom?” she muttered against his skin.</p><p>“Mmm?” His response was a deep rumble in his chest, betraying his desire.</p><p>“Will you have a baby with me?”</p><p>Tom’s eyebrows shot up. He leaned back to look into her eyes, and found them glazed and heavy lidded. She rocked her hips against his, causing him to grind his teeth against his lust.</p><p>She began unbuttoning his shirt, but his lithe fingers wrapped around her wrists like iron, stilling her. “You can’t ask me something like that under the influence.”</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>“Because I’ll take it to heart when I shouldn’t.”</p><p>She blinked several times, as if trying to sober up. “I do mean it, Tom. Not now, obviously, but… someday.” She shook her head. “These leaves are strange.”</p><p>His lips twitched. “They bring out your deepest desires.”</p><p>“Why are you always tricking me?”</p><p>He cocked an eyebrow. “Always? That’s a hefty accusation.”</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. “If you recall, you once cast the <em> Prison of Desire </em> spell over me.”</p><p>“I did break it before I laid a hand on you. Give me credit where credit is due.”</p><p>She swallowed, her hands still caught in his grip. “Well… now you know what I want.”</p><p>“Is that all you want, little witch? Make your demands now. You’re glowing like aphrodite and your knickers are so wet they’re soaking my trousers. I think I’d agree to anything right now.”</p><p>Hermione giggled, which was a pleasant surprise to Tom, as it was a sound he wasn’t used to. Tom released her wrist and waved his hand, and a little box appeared out of thin air into the palm of his hand.</p><p>“I’ll agree to your requests, Miss Dumbledore, but I have one of my own.”</p><p>The tiny velvet box lifted into the air, hovering above his hand. Hermione gazed at it, glassy-eyed and sharply focused all at once. It was a strange kind of effect that Veela leaves gave, both a rush of euphoria and hallucination, but also a heightened sense of concentration.</p><p>Her lips parted.</p><p>The box opened, bearing the most dazzling ring she’d ever seen.</p><p>Her breath left her lungs in a rush.</p><p>“Marry me, Hermione.”</p><p> </p><p>———————</p><p> </p><p>Copies of <em> The Chronomancer </em> lined the shelves next to stacks of <em> The Daily Prophet </em> . The newspapers were neck and neck, the freshness and novelty of Hermione’s paper at war with the political sway and reputation of <em> the Prophet </em>. </p><p>The offices of The Daily Prophet were astir, the new competition putting a fresh wind in the sails of its staff, with the addition of the constant flood of news which kept issues flying off the shelves. </p><p>Walburga Black had just returned from France with her brothers. She grabbed a copy of both papers from the newsstand on the corner of Diagon Alley and Knockturn. Her blue eyes slid across the headlines, then she felt her stomach flutter and sink.</p><p>A cluster of headlines read as follows:</p><p>
<b> <em>Riddle, Bletchley, and Dumbledore: The Tight Race for Minister!</em> </b>
</p><p>
<b> <em>Dufresne, Losing His Touch? Interim Minister &amp; DMLE Head Bogged Down by Investigations</em> </b>
</p><p>
<b> <em>Dolohov Still At Large: What Went Wrong at Azkaban Prison?</em> </b>
</p><p>Walburga tossed a sickle to the stand worker and waved her wand, tucking the newspapers into her bag and turned to leave just as an elf untied a new stack of papers and placed the evening editions on the shelves.</p><p>Walburga turned back quickly and snatched up a paper, her eyes scanning the headline greedily. </p><p>
<b> <em>Dumbledore and Riddle: Engaged?</em> </b>
</p><p>
<em> Former Prophet columnist Hermione Dumbledore has certainly been busy these days, and her complicated life is giving wizarding Britain whiplash! Following a short-lived career with the Ministry’s auror department (we suspect a secret affair gone awry with her boss, Gaspard Dufresne), Hermione has managed to poach several of our Prophet columnists to create her own struggling newspaper, announce her campaign for Minister for Magic, as well as invest in a fledgling potioneer based within a failed factory, Portsmouth Potions (former manufacturer of Sleakeazy’s ™ Hair Potion, see page 14 for coupons). </em>
</p><p>
<em> In the past month since a highly publicized ball was held at Malfoy Manor, The Daily Prophet has confirmed the two Ministerial candidates, Tom Riddle and Hermione Dumbledore, are indeed romantically linked.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> But that’s not all that has come to light. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Our trusted sources told The Daily Prophet that both Dumbledore and Riddle reached out to Witch Weekly in order to schedule an interview regarding a “big forthcoming announcement.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “They want to announce their engagement publicly, but they also feel they have to get ahead of the story,” says a source close to the Dumbledores. “They’ve always been rivals in the eyes of the public, so it only makes sense that they would feel they owe an explanation.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> An explanation is definitely owed, considering their long-professed hatred of one another, not to mention their vastly different ideological stances.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> We at The Daily Prophet have questions, and we know the public will too! </em>
</p><p>
<em> Such as, are these two frauds, or is this truly an enemies-to-lovers romance? </em>
</p><p>
<em> How long have these two been involved? </em>
</p><p>
<em> Is it a coincidence that they are both currently running for office? Could their romance be a publicity stunt? </em>
</p><p>
<em> Are they really engaged? </em>
</p><p>
<em> We don’t have all the answers, but we can confirm that on Wednesday evening, Hermione Dumbledore was photographed in Kettel Court sporting a new piece of jewelry: a golden ring featuring a large emerald, conveniently placed on her ring finger! </em>
</p><p>
<em> You heard it here first: an unexpected and unprecedented wedding is on the horizon! </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Walburga felt her skin tingling, the color slowly draining from her face. She gazed at the pair of photographs on the page. In one, she saw Hermione, the aforementioned ring gleaming in the sunlight. </p><p>In the other, she saw a photograph of them together at the Ostara Ball.</p><p>Her stomach turned as the boy she had loved for the better part of her youth kissed another witch.</p><p>She <em> hated </em> Hermione Dumbledore… with every fiber of her being.</p><p>There weren’t enough curses for the kind of pain she wanted to inflict upon her.</p><p>Deep down, Walburga hadn’t really believed that Tom could love anyone.</p><p>She’d known how much he cared about his ideas, his plans. Being a Black, a wealthy, powerful, <em>pureblood</em> witch, she thought she would fit perfectly into those plans.</p><p>She’d been totally convinced he had kept her close all those years because he planned to marry her.</p><p>But to watch him cast her aside for someone like Hermione was too much for Walburga to comprehend… The bitch championed both <em> muggles </em> and <em> house elves </em>, for Salazar’s sake!</p><p>Walburga cared for Max… and she wanted to see him, to comfort him for his time spent in Azkaban. </p><p>But Walburga couldn’t help but ache from Riddle’s betrayal. She didn’t know what it was like to not want Riddle, simply because she always had.</p><p>So in order to break herself of the habit, she channeled her pain into rage and hatred.</p><p>Hermione Dumbledore was too <em> perfect </em>.</p><p>No one was <em> that </em> perfect. It was too good to be true. </p><p>Something didn’t add up.</p><p>Walburga knew there must be a chink in her armor somewhere…</p><p>She just had to uncover it.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>With less than a month until the ministerial election, London was abuzz with news of the candidates and their rallies, speeches, and campaign promises. Hermione held a rally in central Hogsmeade and answered questions regarding her political platform. </p><p>She reminded the crowd of her accomplishments since arriving in London, of how she’d uncovered the goblins’ plot and built a new wizarding bank. She directed the populace back to her articles, encouraging them to go back and read her detailed essays and the concerns she had raised about the weak points in Britain’s infrastructure. </p><p>She brought up the inefficacy of Azkaban as a prison and assured the public that were she to be elected, Britain would be a safer place than ever before.</p><p>“I, Hermione Dumbledore, promise to build a new prison, with stronger wards, better guards, and stricter safety measures. Not only have I formulated an in-depth blue-print for the prison, but I will contract some of the best magical architects in the world. We will build a prison to rival Nurmengard!”</p><p>Cheers rang out through the village.</p><p>“I have first-hand experience as an auror in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, and I understand intimately the way that law enforcement operates. I’ve consulted Mr. Dufresne and we will be working together to use his own methods of operating his department to implement new strategies to revolutionize every department in the Ministry for Magic. Aren’t you tired of the Ministry being a who’s who club? Aren’t you sick of the political power players, the magical bias, and the mistreatment of magical creatures, even other races? Something <em>must</em> be done - new legislation <em>must</em> be drafted, and I intend to be the champion for change that you all deserve. Let 1949 be the year that you vote for change!”</p><p>The shouts and cheers from the crowd were deafening. </p><p>Of course, Hermione was ushered out of the area following her speech, and led through exit in the back of the Hogs Head Inn before the barrage of questions came regarding her engagement to her opponent, Tom Riddle.</p><p>He was also campaigning hard. That very same day, he held a rally in Diagon Alley, where he voiced concerns regarding the Statute of Secrecy, dark magic and Unforgivables, and called for better magical cooperation between international governments. He spoke of the need for reform in Britain’s educational system, about the need for muggleborn assimilation and more instruction in the area of wandless magic.</p><p>“We teach wandless magic as an advanced skill, when it should be elementary. All wizarding children have the capability of producing wandless magic, but we teach our children to rely upon their wands, thus limiting their magical scope. I’ve often wondered why. Perhaps this was purposeful. Perhaps magic produced by wands is more easily controlled, and perhaps easier to track. Perhaps our government prefers it that way. Perhaps up until now, our government has desired to render us helpless without our Wanda. Students from the African school Uagadou are taught to wield their magic wandlessly from childhood. Wands are only introduced as useful, but not necessary tools. If you elect me, I will aim to instate new educational reform which will strengthen the magical abilities of our youth, because, after all… Magic is Might.”</p><p>A round of applause roared through the alleyway, winding through the twists and turns of its side streets, even echoing through the narrow brick walls of Knockturn Alley.</p><p> </p><p>——————-</p><p> </p><p>“Tom… do you remember Bulgaria, the first time we…”</p><p>Hermione paused, twisting her lips to the side in chagrin. </p><p>Tom sat in the armchair in his flat, a copy of <em>The Chronomancer</em> spread out in his hands. Hermione was standing at the dining room table, mixing dough for scones. </p><p>He lowered the paper and lifted an eyebrow. His lips twitched, but he gazed at her questioningly, as if to force her to speak.</p><p>She rolled her eyes. “The first time we had sex.”</p><p>His eyes narrowed and his mouth curled into a smirk. “Of course… how <em> could </em> I forget?”</p><p>She looked at him in perturbation as she kneaded the dough. “You told me that you were going to Albania. You said a secret for a secret. Will you tell me where you went?”</p><p>He blinked, then folded the paper and sat it aside. She admired the way his sleeves were rolled up over his forearms, revealing his attractive hands and the prominent veins of his forearms.</p><p>He stood and came to stand behind her, pulling her hair over her shoulder and brushing a few strands of hair from her face. “I went to see a very dangerous, but very powerful warlock. He had knowledge that I desired for myself. I also had to visit… someone.”</p><p>“Someone?”</p><p>He nodded. </p><p>She took her hands out of the dough and turned to face him. “I thought we weren’t keeping secrets anymore?”</p><p>“You’ll know everything in time, little witch. Are you ready to show me more?”</p><p>Hermione took a deep breath. She’d been procrastinating. She was somewhat nervous of his reaction to the rest of her memories.</p><p>Her eyes flicked to the emerald ring sitting on the table beside the dough. His eyes followed her line of sight.</p><p>Her gaze lifted back to his.</p><p>He brushed the back of his knuckles against her cheek, then slid his hand behind her neck and pulled her closer. His lips covered hers, and she melted instantly.</p><p>His smell never failed to intoxicate her.</p><p>There was a deep, rumbling sound from his chest as he slid an arm around her waist, pulling her tight against his strong frame.</p><p>The flour on her apron dusted his black trousers.</p><p>A moment later, she was gasping for air, and he chuckled as he broke away. His grip on her waist didn’t loosen, however, and she fell weakly against him, wondering how he always seemed to zap her strength with only his lips.</p><p>His leaned in and his breath fell against her ear as he whispered, “No, I could never forget how tight your cunt was when I entered you for the first time. I don’t believe I’ve thanked you yet for making me your first, have I?”</p><p>Hermione’s eyes popped wide open and her cheeks grew hot. “You are <em>vulgar</em>, sir.”</p><p>“What’s vulgar is the way you swallowed every last drop of my cum last night.”</p><p>“Merlin’s sake, Tom,” she protested, pushing him away as her cheeks blazed red. “Let me go!”</p><p>“No, little witch,” he breathed. “Never.”</p><p>Her heart skipped a beat at his tone. She stopped struggling and peered up at him. </p><p>His coal black eyes roved her face and then he leaned down to kiss her again, his tongue swiping over her lips before penetrating her mouth sensually. </p><p>She whimpered, and when he pulled away she nearly chased his lips, her hunger piqued.</p><p>“Show me,” he whispered.</p><p>Hermione swallowed, her veins swimming with the drug of Tom Riddle, his dark eyes filling her vision until he was all that she could see or feel.</p><p>“Trust me, Hermione,” he commanded, and she instantly dropped her walls with a soft exhale.</p><p>Tom slid past her mental walls gently, like a shadow slipping beneath the crack of a door. </p><p>She watched, a bystander, as he rifled through her memories. She helped to guide him, giving him mental prods as he touched upon important memories.</p><p>He observed her third year, seeming somewhat amused by her hatred of divination and somewhat fascinated by the events at the end of her third year. He raised an eyebrow at Hermione being given a time turner in her third year. She showed him just enough about Sirius, Lupin, and Peter to get him up to speed, then proceeded to move on to fourth year.</p><p>She could feel his shock at the Triwizard Tournament, his annoyance at her short-lived romance with Viktor Krum, and she could feel him nearly rolling his eyes at her little spat with Ron.</p><p>She relayed what she knew of the end of the tournament, the portkey and the graveyard put in place by Barty Crouch Jr, and the horrendous events that occurred in that graveyard.</p><p>Fear once again gripped her heart as she relived the memory of Harry appearing with the cup and Cedric’s body, the terror in his voice as he screamed, “He’s back, Voldemort is back!”</p><p>Hermione shivered as Tom withdrew from her mind.</p><p>He gripped her shoulders and pulled her against him, sensing her distress.</p><p>He said nothing, only held her. </p><p>Moments passed in silence as she tried to calm her body.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” she whispered, her teeth clattering. “I haven’t really… faced everything that happened. It was barely all over by the time I came here.”</p><p>He said nothing, but only stroked her spine gently.</p><p>At length, his lips parted as if he would speak, but words evaded him.</p><p>Minutes passed before he spoke </p><p>He took a deep breath, and then he muttered, “Perhaps you need a mind healer, Hermione.”</p><p>“What mind healer could I see that wouldn’t tell the ministry the truth?”</p><p>Tom ran his tongue over his top teeth in thought. “Perhaps Dumbledore knows someone.”</p><p>She blinked, then nodded as the tremors slowly stopped.</p><p>“How did you come here?” he asked softly. “Did an object send you here?”</p><p>She leaned back, a shocked expression painting her features. She nodded once, then murmured, “How did you know?”</p><p>“I dreamed about you. Before you appeared. I heard your voice. You were sent here by an object that I made, weren’t you?”</p><p>Hermione bit her lip. “I believe so. But… there’s much, much more before we come to that.”</p><p>“If it’s too much, then we should wait. I can wait… as long as necessary.”</p><p>She took a deep breath and looked around the room. “I should get these scones in. Then we should keep going. I can’t put it off forever, and… and you need to know. We… <em>have </em> to talk about all of this.” She looked up at him, noting the concerned look in his eyes. “I can’t reconcile the terror you inflicted then with the person you are now. It just doesn’t feel real.”</p><p>He lifted a hand to her cheek and brushed his thumb against her skin. “I feel that way about you as well, little witch. I wonder often how it was possible that you crashed into my world and derailed my life so completely… I fear some nights that I’ll wake up and it will all have been a dream.”</p><p>Hermione lifted her arms around his neck and threaded her fingers into the hair at the base of his scalp. “Then let’s never wake up.”</p><p> </p><p>——————</p><p> </p><p>After they’d both had a drink and a scone, they continued their delving into her memories. She showed him little snippets about his followers, memories of her time at Hogwarts and her relationship with the Weasleys. She showed him Harry’s difficulties during fifth year, his strange visions and epileptic episodes, and the breach at Azkaban which released the death eaters. He watched the slow takeover of the Ministry and the interference from Umbridge at Hogwarts. Then finally, she showed him the start of Dumbledore’s Army and their private lessons with Harry in the Room of Requirement.</p><p>She was usually able to read his reactions to her memories, but this time he was gravely silent, betraying nothing, communicating no emotion.</p><p>He rifled through her memories until he touched upon the ambush with his Death Eaters at the Department of Mysteries.</p><p>He watched the duel and the death of Sirius Black. The only surge of emotion Hermione felt was a jolt of rage that flew down her spine at the curse which was cast by Antonin Dolohov, Maximillian’s son.</p><p>Then, at last, Voldemort appeared, and an epic duel with Dumbledore ensued, destroying much of the atrium of the Ministry.</p><p>Tom watched as Voldemort possessed Harry’s body, then quickly left and disapparated after the appearance of Minister Fudge.</p><p>Hermione expected him to pull out of her mind then, but he dove back into her stores of memories, searching through them rapidly until he settled the one he was searching for. </p><p>Hermione was confined to a bed in the hospital wing at Hogwarts. Her chest ached, liquid curdling in her lungs as the curse worked its way through her chest cavity. She coughed up blood, and took all various kinds of potions throughout the day, weaving in and out of consciousness as her body and magic fought the effects of the curse.</p><p>Madam Pomfrey checked on her at intervals, casting diagnostic spells as she monitored her recovery.</p><p>“You were very lucky, Miss Granger. If that curse had been spoken aloud, you would not have lived to see daylight.”</p><p>Tom pulled out of her mind.</p><p>Hermione was dizzy from the onslaught of his legilimency, but he reached out a hand to steady her. </p><p>She looked up to find his face full of unbridled rage, jaw muscles tense and rippling with frustration.</p><p>In one swift movement, he reached out and ripped her apron and the front of her dress, baring her chest and clavicle. He waved his hand in a wandless revelio, revealing the long, grisly scar that slashed diagonally across her chest.</p><p>“Who cast it?” he spat.</p><p>Her lips parted. “Dolohov… Antonin Dolohov.”</p><p>He blinked. His fingers brushed over the scar softly. “I know this curse.”</p><p>“You do?”</p><p>He nodded, his adam’s apple bobbing as he swallowed. “I invented it,” he muttered wryly.</p><p>Her lashes fluttered as she blinked and looked down to where his fingertips brushed the scar. </p><p>“Does it still bother you?”</p><p>“There are more important things to discuss besides my scar-“</p><p>“Answer me.”</p><p>“… Sometimes.”</p><p>He exhaled in frustration, his lips forming a thin line. “It might disappear if I kill his father. But I can’t do that yet. I made an oath.”</p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes. “I don’t want you to kill anyone.” Her brows knit. “An oath to who?”</p><p>He pressed his tongue into the inside of his cheek. “Walburga, unfortunately.”</p><p>Hermione’s mouth fell open in shock. “Excuse me?”</p><p>His eyes found hers and sharpened. “Don’t make it something that it isn’t.”</p><p>“What did you promise?”</p><p>He took a deep breath, then sighed. “She promised me the loyalty of the Blacks… in exchange for getting Dolohov out of Azkaban safely.”</p><p>“<em>Oh</em>.”</p><p>His cheek muscles flexed. “That’s all it was.”</p><p>“When did you see her?”</p><p>He cocked his head. “After Ostara… Before I killed Tuft.”</p><p>Hermione swallowed, then looked down at the floor. </p><p>“Hermione.”</p><p>She looked back up, pain and uncertainty in her eyes.</p><p>He examined her face, then reached up and brushed his thumb across her chin. “She came to me because Dolohov was in prison, and she thought it was my doing. She has developed some sort of closeness with him, and wanted me to get him out. There was nothing more discussed. Now the Blacks owe me, which is valuable.” He lifted her chin, bringing her gaze up to meet his. “The wizard who dueled Dumbledore… that was me?”</p><p>Hermione nodded, her eyes locked with his. </p><p>“Dumbledore couldn’t defeat me.”</p><p>She shook her head slightly. “No, he couldn’t.”</p><p>“Which makes me more powerful than Grindelwald.”</p><p>“In the future, yes.”</p><p>He seemed to contemplate for a moment. Then he said, “I’m fascinated to know that the potion worked. The cauldron in the graveyard. I found it in some of Slytherin’s personal writings in Lestrange’s library.” He walked over to his bookcase and pulled out a scroll from the top shelf and unfurled it, his eyes lost in perusing its contents. </p><p>She couldn’t help a smile from spreading across her face. It was so like Tom not to care about the human aspect of her memories, or the implications of his actions.</p><p>He only cared about her welfare, and his magic.</p><p>She loved him for it.</p><p>“Do you really believe all this pureblood nonsense, Tom?”</p><p>His eyes ceased their sliding back and forth and flicked up to her. “You should know by now that I don’t care much for pureblood politics… but my followers do.”</p><p>“Why do you cater to their beliefs?”</p><p>He rolled up the scroll and put it back in its place. “Power, Hermione. <em>Knowledge</em>.”</p><p>“What knowledge?”</p><p>“Do you know the amount of arcane spells and rituals I’ve learned about from their libraries? Spells they could all care less about. Books covered in dust from disuse. Do you know that there are rites that their families partake of every year that are not recorded in any book? Ancient magic that has been passed down for centuries in their families. No, I don’t envy their blood. I envy their history. <em> Knowledge</em>, little witch. <em> Power</em>. That is what I crave.” He approached her, his eyes flicking over her body. They paused where the top of her dress was torn, teasing him with a glimpse of the curve of her breast. “And you, of course.”</p><p>She ran her fingers up his arm, tracing the contours of his muscles. “What do you think they will do when they hear about our engagement?”</p><p>“They will do nothing… or they will all die.”</p><p>Hermione laughed and shook her head. “You can't kill everyone, Tom.”</p><p>“I sincerely hope you don’t mean that as a challenge… because then I would have to prove you incorrect.”</p><p>“What if they find out that I’m muggleborn?”</p><p>He ran his tongue over his top teeth slowly, then he took a deep breath. “Then I suppose they would all have to make a choice.”</p><p>Hermione swallowed. “And if they all left you?”</p><p>He smirked, then turned to take a seat on the sofa. “Then they’d all better watch their backs.”</p><p>She walked over and slipped into his lap. His arms encircled her, pulling her against his chest. “I still can’t believe you went to see Walburga,” she said sullenly. “You know I can’t stand her.”</p><p>“First of all, she came to see me. Secondly… did you or did you not kiss Dufresne?”</p><p>“We weren’t together!” she protested.</p><p>“That’s all very well, but I doubt you would be as forgiving if I’d kissed Walburga during our… little break.”</p><p>Her mouth fell open. “That’s different.” </p><p>His lips curved into a devilish smile. “How?”</p><p>“It just is!”</p><p>“Did you like him? Do not lie to me.”</p><p>Her lips parted. “I… felt things for him. Yes.”</p><p>“Then that makes it worse. I felt nothing for Walburga.”</p><p>“We are soulmates, Tom. No one can rival what I feel for you.”</p><p>“I’m aware, darling.” He reached out and tucked a curl behind her ear. “I’m desperate to know the rest of your story, Hermione. I want to know how you came by my Tempaestus.”</p><p>“Your what?”</p><p>“The object that sent you here.”</p><p>She turned her head and gazed out through the window. The sky was turning dark. </p><p>“It’s late.”</p><p>He nodded. “Your memories take hours to sort through. Probably because you talk so much.”</p><p>“I do not, you arse!”</p><p>He smirked, then cleared his throat. “I can think of a better use for our time… at least for the remainder of the night.”</p><p>Her eyebrows lifted. “Oh?”</p><p>He shot her a wink and flashed his perfectly white teeth in a wolfish grin, causing her heart to skip three beats.</p><p>She wondered if she would always react to him the same way, with her stomach turning flips.</p><p>Given the way he was looking at her now, she would bet her galleons that she would.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The next morning, Hermione and Tom woke up slowly. With no election obligations, no jobs to rush off to, and no other responsibilities weighing on them, they rose to consciousness in degrees, a tangled web of limbs beneath the sheets of Tom’s bed. </p><p dir="ltr">Hermione mumbled, still drowsy with her eyes closed, “Do we continue our legilimency today?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Yes, little witch,” he whispered against her frizzy brown hair. “But first I have something to show you.”</p><p dir="ltr">That helped with her ascent to wakefulness. Her eyes popped open. “Show me? What is it?”</p><p dir="ltr">The corner of his lips turned up in a lopsided smile. “You’ll see. Get your pretty arse up and get dressed.”</p><p dir="ltr">She hopped spritely out of bed, all bare feet and tanned skin. He watched her as she loped into the bathroom, his arms folded behind his head, a lazy grin on his face.</p><p dir="ltr">Tom had never imagined he would enjoy intimacy with another creature like he did with Hermione. He had always lived his life in a highly structured, private way, wound up tightly like a coiled viper, his mind an armored shield, a fortress none could penetrate.</p><p dir="ltr">Hermione had slipped beneath his carefully erected walls, razed his guard and caught him entirely by surprise.</p><p dir="ltr">He wanted her. He coveted her. He thought of her at all hours of the day.</p><p dir="ltr">Most of the time, he held his emotions in check so that even she couldn’t decipher the depth of his obsession with her. He feared that if she knew how utterly and violently attached to her he had become, that she would run from him.</p><p dir="ltr">His love for her had a murderous quality to it.</p><p dir="ltr">In truth, he felt such an all-consuming fixation for the witch that he often wanted to skewer someone just for looking at her.</p><p dir="ltr">Not the best situation considering his witch was a public figure, mere weeks from being elected Minister for Magic. A very good thing Tom was capable of self-control.</p><p dir="ltr">He looked around his flat, remembering the first night that Hermione had stayed over. He let himself feel nostalgia, since he realized this would be one of the last nights they would spend together in his flat. </p><p dir="ltr">He stood and immediately began the ritual of making his bed, folding down the corners with militant precision that scratched an itch somewhere in his psyche each morning. </p><p dir="ltr">An hour later, Tom was fully dressed and reading with a cup of coffee in his hand and a cigarette hanging out of his mouth when Hermione stepped out into the sitting room in a brilliant red playsuit with a cheeky collar and tennis shoes. She’d cut her long hair to a length that was currently trendy for the time period, about shoulder length, and had mastered a charm which smoothed her hair and gave her a set of elegant pin curls.</p><p dir="ltr">She’d bought a golden tube of cherry red lipstick from Tangee, so she swiped some on her lips and squeezed a pump or two of perfume on her pulse points and she was ready to go.</p><p dir="ltr">When she emerged from the hallway into the sitting room, Tom slammed his book shut and let his eyes slowly rake over her appearance. He took the cigarette from his mouth and exhaled smoke, arching an eyebrow. </p><p dir="ltr">“We have somewhere to be, Hermione. Have you decided you’d rather stay in today?”</p><p dir="ltr">Confusion shone in her eyes. “Excuse me?”</p><p dir="ltr">He stood, at quite an imposing height given her own stature and the crown of the ceiling. He made his way over to her, his eyes smoldering with heat as he lifted a hand to press his thumb against her nipple, rubbing it over the fabric of the playsuit.</p><p dir="ltr">“You come out here looking like that… and all I can think about is fucking you in front of a mirror so I can watch your face when you come on my cock.” He wrapped his hand around her throat and pulled her closer. Hermione’s eyes grew wide and she bit her lip, getting a little bit of red lipstick on her teeth. </p><p dir="ltr">He smiled as he looked down at her. “This lipstick… I so desperately want to make a mess of it.” His bottom lip tucked in as he ran his tongue over it. “I wonder what color pink it will turn when it mixes with my cum.”</p><p dir="ltr">Hermione’s mouth fell open as her breath left her lungs. Her heart thudded violently in her chest, matching the rhythm of the pulse between her legs. </p><p dir="ltr">He smirked, and leaned in closer to whisper, “Close your mouth before I fill it, darling.”</p><p dir="ltr">Then he kissed her cheek. His hand left her breast and he moved away, leaving her feeling very heated and very empty.</p><p dir="ltr">She cleared her throat. “Where are we going?”</p><p dir="ltr">His black eyes flicked to hers. He reached out a hand. “I will show you.”</p><p dir="ltr">She looked down at the proffered hand and took it hesitantly. </p><p dir="ltr">Hermione felt a tugging in her stomach, and a moment later they disapparated away.</p><p dir="ltr"><br/>
————-</p><p> </p><p dir="ltr">He obviously intended to tease her until she couldn’t stand the suspense any longer. He brought them first to a little muggle breakfast cafe. Hermione didn’t recognize the street.</p><p dir="ltr">“Where are we?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Oxford.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Why Oxford?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Because this is where I brought you.”</p><p dir="ltr">Hermione rolled her eyes. “No shit.”</p><p dir="ltr">He subjected her to a full English breakfast and a steaming cup of tea, which Hermione complained about but actually thoroughly enjoyed. Then he took her on a walk around the city, and Hermione bit back a grin as she realized that her reality now included holding hands with Voldemort while they toured muggle streets, as if they were just any regular couple.</p><p dir="ltr">She felt a fluttering in her stomach as she realized that they were.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Well</em>, she thought. <em>Perhaps not so regular… he is still a murderous raving lunatic, but at least he’s a murderous lunatic that happens to look very fit in a suit-</em></p><p dir="ltr">“I can hear every thought, love,” he whispered in her ear. “You are thinking quite loud, so you might want to work on your occlumency.”</p><p dir="ltr">“You are so insufferable,” Hermione huffed.</p><p dir="ltr">“According to your potions professor, you are also insufferable… an insufferable know-it-all, isn’t that right?”</p><p dir="ltr">She glared at him. “Do not use my memories against me, or I shall refuse to show you any more.”</p><p dir="ltr">He tutted. “I don’t think so. You’re bound by oath, love.”</p><p dir="ltr">Hermione exhaled petulantly. “Is this all you wanted to show me today?”</p><p dir="ltr">His lips twitched. “Take my hand.”</p><p dir="ltr">She stared down at his offered hand, palm up.</p><p dir="ltr">Her eyes snapped to him and she glared, but took it anyway. All she heard was his deep chuckle as they disapparated and reappeared on a stone path.</p><p dir="ltr">Hermione looked around herself, taking in the perfectly trimmed evergreen trees lining the path, and the rolling hills, their grass cut in perfect checkerboard patterns. The hill before them was just steep enough that she couldn’t quite see what was beyond, but it was obvious that the path led somewhere. </p><p dir="ltr">“Where are we?”</p><p dir="ltr">He took her hand and began leading her down the path. “Wychwood Forest, Oxfordshire.”</p><p dir="ltr">“I don’t think I’ve ever heard of it.”</p><p dir="ltr">“It is known as a secret forest, which is part of an estate owned by a muggle named Lord Rotherwick. It is famed for its healing springs among the muggles, but there is a story among wizards about a unicorn who fell into the springs and drowned in order to save its owner. The springs have been magical ever since. What the muggles don’t know is that part of the forest belonged to a wizard and is protected by the fidelius charm.”</p><p dir="ltr">“But why are we here?”</p><p dir="ltr">Tom’s lips curved into a smile and he pointed ahead. They’d just come up over the hill, and she saw that the path led into a great green forest which was enclosed by a massive iron gate. Her forehead wrinkled, because there was nothing beyond the gate, only trees.</p><p dir="ltr">Tom reached into his pocket and took out a slip of parchment, which he then handed to Hermione. </p><p dir="ltr">Her brow furrowed as she took the parchment and unfolded it, then read its contents, which was written in Tom’s spiky penmanship.</p><p dir="ltr">

</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>The primary residence of Tom Riddle and Hermione Dumbledore is located at 21 Tartarus Way, Wychwood Forest, Oxfordshire. </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">Hermione’s lips parted. When she looked up, just beyond the gate appeared the rest of the stone path, which had not been there before. It led to a brick-paved courtyard which wound circularly around a great fountain.</p><p dir="ltr">Just beyond the courtyard was a massive house.</p><p dir="ltr">Was it a house? It had the all the appearance of a mammoth mansion, made of dark stone and bedecked with gothic cornices and wrought iron cresting that wrapped like lace around each of its stories. There were octagonal turrets on each side, vines of ivy climbing up like serpents and framing its many arching cathedral windows. There were great lanterns on every side of the house, and Hermione could only imagine that in the evening it would be absolutely stunning, lit by the flames of the lanterns and silhouetted against the forest beyond. It almost gave the impression of a great cathedral, centuries old.</p><p dir="ltr">“I don’t understand,” she murmured, glancing at Tom.</p><p dir="ltr">He tugged on her hand. “Come. I’ll explain.”</p><p dir="ltr">He led a very bewildered Hermione up to the gate. With a mere wave of his hand, the gate groaned open and then took to the path which led through the courtyard. </p><p dir="ltr">Hermione paused at the fountain. The statue in its center bore a man standing in a small boat, a great staff in his hand which he used to steer. Water sprang out all around him, and out of the pool below, ghostly figures reached their hands out toward him.</p><p dir="ltr">“Are those meant to be Inferi?” Hermione asked, put off by the scene. </p><p dir="ltr">He cocked his head. “Why would you automatically think of Inferi?”</p><p dir="ltr">“No reason,” she said innocently.</p><p dir="ltr">“It is meant to be Charon, the ferryman of the Underworld. Those are the souls of the River Styx.” He peered up at the mansion. “This estate is called Acheron Place, and it is yours, if you want it.”</p><p dir="ltr">“But I don’t understand. How did you come by it?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Follow me.”</p><p dir="ltr">He took her hand and immediately apparated them. They reappeared in a large bedroom. The ceiling  of the bedroom consisted of a large glass dome revealing the summer sky. The wall across from them was made up of great floor-to-ceiling cathedral windows and a pair of French doors leading out onto the balcony.</p><p dir="ltr">He took her hand and led her through the doors onto the veranda.</p><p dir="ltr">Hermione instantly gasped as her eyes fell on an enchanting sight.</p><p dir="ltr">Below them lay a garden filled with all sorts of growing things, magical herbs and plants, colorful flora, all walled in by perfectly trimmed hedges. </p><p dir="ltr">But the garden wasn’t the image that took Hermione’s breath away.</p><p dir="ltr">Just beyond the gardens extended the rest of the forest, and in the sunlight filtering through its canopy she caught sight of nearly a dozen unicorns grazing happily.</p><p dir="ltr">They shook their heads, their majestic manes glowing in the sunlight as they pranced about on their golden hooves in what could be, essentially, her backyard. The ones that were grown were a brilliant shade of pure white, brighter than snow, but Hermione spotted two rare babies, their coats a blue-gray color as they followed along behind their mothers.</p><p dir="ltr">“Merlin, Tom! Whose unicorns are these? How did they get here?”</p><p dir="ltr">He came to stand beside her, slipping an arm around her waist as he replied, “I’ve told you before that I occasionally stumble across some… interesting things whilst astral projecting. One thing I discovered while performing a bit of surveillance on our dear, recently departed Wilhelmina Tuft, was that not only was she involved in the breeding of thestrals, but she and her husband both participated in the trading of illegal substances, unicorn blood being among them. As you know, the purchase and sale of unicorn blood is against the law. A wizard by the name of Barnabas Keys has long spearheaded the illegal breeding of unicorns for the purpose of draining their blood, both here and in America. He transported a group of his unicorns by way of illegal portkey to northern Vermont in order to expand his operation.”</p><p dir="ltr">Hermione’s eyes widened in horror. “A… unicorn blood dealer?”</p><p dir="ltr">Tom nodded. “I may have threatened him with either exposure or death… if I’m being honest, it was both. In any case, he signed over the deed to this property and promised to swear off the unicorn trade. I forced him to make the unbreakable vow, so I don’t think he’ll be breaking it. I figured that would please you more than the house, given your passion for magical creatures.”</p><p dir="ltr">Hermione blinked several times, then turned to go back into the bedroom. She tried a door on the opposite wall and emerged into another smaller room. </p><p dir="ltr">“What is this room for?”</p><p dir="ltr">Tom came in after her and responded, “It has a few intended uses. Could be an adjoining bedroom… or a nursery.”</p><p dir="ltr">Hermione’s eyebrows shot up. “Oh… right.”</p><p dir="ltr">His face betrayed nothing as he watched her.</p><p dir="ltr">She perused the luxurious suite, examining its massive closets and lavish marble bathroom before making her way out into the hallway. She stood against the railing and looked out over the foyer, with its checkerboard marble floors and curving staircases on either side. She walked down the hallway and approached two massive doors carved ornately from heavy mahogany. She tried them and found them unlocked, so she pressed down on the thumb-lever of the handle and entered with Tom at her side.</p><p dir="ltr">Her mouth fell open.</p><p dir="ltr">She emerged onto the second story of an immense library, a wall of books which wrapped around a narrow walkway, framed in by an iron filigree railing that overlooked the bottom floor. Like the master suite, the ceiling was a dome of glass that displayed the sky. Her eyes took in the great black marble fireplace below, the teardrop chandeliers above, and the cathedral-style stained glass windows that faced the forest. There was a desk on one side and velvet chesterfield sofas on another. The library was a bit smaller and cozier than the one at Malfoy Manor, but it was every bit as decadent.</p><p dir="ltr">She turned around to meet Tom’s gaze. He had leaned against the doorframe, and was lighting a cigarette.</p><p dir="ltr">“Whose house was this?”</p><p dir="ltr">He breathed in deeply, then exhaled the smoke. “It served as Keys’ headquarters for his British dealings. No one lived here, save a group of house elves. They were tasked with caring for the unicorns, but they have been freed and await a meeting with you.”</p><p dir="ltr">Hermione swallowed, her eyes still roaming the opulent space. “You… you blackmailed me a mansion?”</p><p dir="ltr">His lips turned up at the corners and he inclined his head, cigarette hanging from his mouth. “I did, yes.”</p><p dir="ltr">“And a… forest of unicorns.”</p><p dir="ltr">“They’re yours now.”</p><p dir="ltr">She bit her lip. “When do we move in?”</p><p dir="ltr">He cocked a brow. “I take it you like it, then?”</p><p dir="ltr">She rubbed her lips together, then nodded. “I’ve always wanted a library.”</p><p dir="ltr">He approached her and lifted a hand to rest at the base of her throat. “So have I. I shall take great pleasure in fucking you against the shelves.”</p><p dir="ltr">She rolled her eyes but couldn’t help but smile. “This is ours? We’re going to live here? In Oxfordshire?”</p><p dir="ltr">“It’s not far from London. You can apparate to work at the Ministry easily enough.”</p><p dir="ltr">“But what if you win?”</p><p dir="ltr">“I don’t intend to.”</p><p dir="ltr">Hermione cocked her head. “Tom… you’ve been campaigning so hard. How can you say that?”</p><p dir="ltr">“I have been. You’re right. And all of my supporters will vote for you, when I withdraw and announce my endorsement of your campaign.”</p><p dir="ltr">Her smile fell into a scowl. “I don’t want you to do that. I want to win fair and square.”</p><p dir="ltr">“I have no doubt that you would, but I do not like leaving anything to chance. You should know that about me by now.”</p><p dir="ltr">“I don’t like it.”</p><p dir="ltr">He ran his thumb along her cheekbone. “Look at it this way… we aren’t giving the other candidates any hope of winning. It’s called teamwork, that’s what it is. You and I will dominate every sector of society. We will be the most powerful pair the world of magic has ever seen. For my part, I will do everything in my power to support you, and even teach you the things that I know, if you’ll let me.” He threaded his fingers with hers. “In my mind, there is no Tom Riddle or Hermione Granger. There is only us, and what we build together. Let me give you a throne worthy to seat you, Hermione.”</p><p dir="ltr">Her firewhiskey eyes roved his face. She lifted a hand and brushed her fingertips along the sharp line of his jawbone. The sunlight from the ceiling danced over her face as her lips turned up in a mysterious smile. “I would much prefer it if you were my throne, Mr. Riddle.”</p><p dir="ltr">His eyebrows lifted sharply over his glittering black eyes as he brought the cigarette back to his lips. “That can be arranged.”</p><p dir="ltr">She played with the buttons of his shirt. “What will you do, then, if you don’t plan to win the election?”</p><p dir="ltr">He paused as he blew out smoke, deep in thought, before answering, “I went to see Dumbledore last week.”</p><p dir="ltr">Her lips parted. “Oh?”</p><p dir="ltr">“He’s given me the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts.”</p><p dir="ltr">Her mouth fell open. “Are you serious?”</p><p dir="ltr">“I am.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Tom!” she exclaimed, her eyes bright. “That’s so exciting. You’ve always wanted the position!”</p><p dir="ltr">He nodded. “Which means I’ll only be home on weekends. Of course, I can always give you detention if you’re craving a seat on your throne.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Hmm,” Hermione hummed, a playful smile on her lips. “Sex in your office, or sex in mine? So many options.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Both,” he breathed, then leaned down to press his lips to hers.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">

<p dir="ltr">Later that evening, Tom and Hermione resumed their discussion of her memories, examining the events which occurred in the original timeline.</p><p dir="ltr">He sat in his armchair in his flat and she stood at the window, watching the owner of the shrunken head shop across the street close up shop for the night.</p><p dir="ltr">“It’s called the Room of Requirement?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Yes,” Hermione replied. “Also known as the come and go room. Did you think you were the only one to ever discover it?”</p><p dir="ltr">Tom blinked, twisting his lips to the side and cocking an eyebrow. “No. I was aware others had used it… but I doubted anyone was clever enough to comprehend its purpose, or how its magic operated. Most stumble upon it by accident.” He narrowed his eyes. “I’d once thought I might…” He trailed off, lost in thought.</p><p dir="ltr">“Hide the diadem there?”</p><p dir="ltr">His eyes cut to hers, sharp and alert. “It seems you know a great deal more than I thought you did. How strange to have someone already informed on the errant thoughts in my head.”</p><p dir="ltr">She fought back a smile. “Yes, well… I did help to destroy you, so studying your <em>errant thoughts</em> was a necessity.”</p><p dir="ltr">“So it appears. How did you come to know of it?”</p><p dir="ltr">“The Room of Requirement? Or the diadem?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Both.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Well… You’ll find out about the diadem soon enough. But the Room of Requirement… The house elves at Hogwarts all know about it.” She giggled. “Dobby once used it to help Winky sober up from too much butterbeer.”</p><p dir="ltr">He raised a brow. “Malfoy’s elf?”</p><p dir="ltr">Hermione nodded. “Harry freed him from servitude to Lucius in second year.”</p><p dir="ltr">Tom nodded slowly. “Abraxas’ son.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Yes.”</p><p dir="ltr">He was quiet for a moment, then asked, “Who will Abraxas marry?”</p><p dir="ltr">She shrugged apologetically. “That I don’t know. I was quite disenchanted with the entire Malfoy clan and the less I knew about them, the better.”</p><p dir="ltr">Tom leaned back, folding his hands behind his head. “But you were close with the redheaded clan. The <em>Weasels</em>.” He said it caustically, his voice laced with disdain.</p><p dir="ltr">“<em>Weasleys</em>. Yes, I was,” she said firmly, tossing him a disapproving glare. “They were very good to me.”</p><p dir="ltr">Tom slid his tongue along his top teeth. At length, he stood and approached the window where she stood, leaning his shoulder against the window frame. “Come here, witch.”</p><p dir="ltr">Hermione dragged her eyes away from the lamp lit street to peer at him. He stood watching her with a look that could only be described as possessive.</p><p dir="ltr">She moved closer until she stood before him, staring up into his shadowed gaze. He reached out and threaded his fingers into her curls, pulling her head back by her hair none too gently, so that he was looking down directly into her amber-colored eyes. “Mrs. Riddle suits you much better than Mrs. Weasley,” he whispered. “Show me more.”</p><p dir="ltr">She nodded, and then felt him dive gently into her mind, so she allowed her mental barricade to dissolve, the walls of her occlumency melting away at his invasion.</p><p dir="ltr">She had come to almost enjoy the presence of him in her mind. The first time, it had felt uncomfortable. Too much, almost like the first time they’d had sex.</p><p dir="ltr">But soon, Hermione came to revel in his smooth entry, the precise manner in which he sorted through her memories, even the unnerving amount of intimacy that accompanied his legilimency.</p><p dir="ltr">Some legilimens could only read the events. Very few could pick up on the very thoughts and emotions accompanying the memories.</p><p dir="ltr">Even Hermione sometimes had a hard time recalling those things. She imagined some of those things had been repressed due to trauma.</p><p dir="ltr">But Tom could. With ease, he dug up every deeply buried facet of her past, her hopes and dreams, even her fears.</p><p dir="ltr">She realized more and more that he was not simply a clever wizard… not merely a determined one… but he was a magical prodigy, the likes of which the world had perhaps never seen before.</p><p dir="ltr">Tom Riddle truly was spellbinding.</p><p dir="ltr">Sometimes, to her own shock and bewilderment, she would find herself feeling outmatched by his brilliance and charm.</p><p dir="ltr">In those moments, she reminded herself that he was her soulmate, and that she possessed strengths that he desperately needed.</p><p dir="ltr">She’d remind herself of the wraithlike Voldemort, a madman, a murderer, a Dark Lord living a half-life, destroyed by three teenagers. </p><p dir="ltr">That is what he is without you, she reminded herself. Without you, his life is a tragedy.</p><p dir="ltr">If he heard her thoughts, he didn’t react.</p><p dir="ltr">He took his time examining her memories of sixth year. Hermione relived the almost constant fear that plagued her during that year, the countless conversations had with Harry about Draco’s behavior, her repressed feelings for Ron and her jealousy over Lavender Brown, and then, the sorrow and terror she experienced when the Burrow was razed by Bellatrix and Greyback.</p><p dir="ltr">Hermione heard Tom’s voice distantly. </p><p dir="ltr">“Do you want me to keep going, Hermione?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Yes,” she found herself whispering. “You have to.”</p><p dir="ltr">The memories shifted. Harry was explaining to Hermione and Ron the task that Dumbledore had given him, to retrieve Slughorn’s memory. Then, the horrifying night when Ron was poisoned with the mead intended for Dumbledore.</p><p dir="ltr">Hermione was somewhat embarrassed by the scene in the infirmary when Ron mumbled her name, causing Lavender to flee in tears. The joy and triumph she felt in the moment came flooding back, although now it felt so utterly adolescent and hollow. Had that only been three years ago? It felt like a lifetime had passed since that moment.</p><p dir="ltr">If Tom was jealous, he betrayed nothing.</p><p dir="ltr">Once again, dread and panic struck when Katie Bell was nearly killed by a cursed necklace. Tom flipped quickly through memories of Harry’s duel with Draco, the use of sectumsempra, which caused Tom to speak for the first time through the mental channel that had recently opened up between them. </p><p dir="ltr"><em>That’s where you learned that curse,</em> his voice echoed in her mind.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>It was Snape’s creation,</em> she thought in response.  <em>Harry discovered it in Snape’s old potions book.</em></p><p dir="ltr">
<em>It’s strange to learn of followers of mine that are not even born yet.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Snape was an incredible occlumens. He even fooled you,</em> she replied.</p><p dir="ltr">She felt his amusement.</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>I shall try my best not to take my revenge upon him when we do eventually meet.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">Hermione said no more, because she knew the memories that were forthcoming would be painful for them both.</p><p dir="ltr">These were a few of the memories she had long feared to share. </p><p dir="ltr">
<em>You’re anxious, little witch. I can feel it.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">She didn’t respond.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Do you want to stop for the night? </em>he asked softly to her mind.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>No, </em>she thought back to him. <em>Keep going please. </em></p><p dir="ltr">He said nothing more, only delved back into her mind.</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>Harry wept on the floor of the common room. He told Ron and Hermione everything, how Voldemort had split his soul into seven pieces, detailing the memories he’d seen in Dumbledore’s pensieve and the events that occurred within the ocean cave, how they’d narrowly escaped the Inferi only to have retrieved a fake locket.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>Harry could hardly articulate what happened in the astronomy tower. He broke off upon explaining Draco’s task to kill Dumbledore and the role of the vanishing cabinet in letting the Death Eaters into Hogwarts.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>“Snape killed him,” Harry said bitterly, his voice hoarse from his racking sobs. Hermione wrapped her arms around him, if only to provide some warmth because despite the heat of the fire, Harry felt so, so cold. “He trusted Snape… and he betrayed him.”</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>Hermione took the locket from Harry’s hand and examined the note. </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>“R.A.B.,” she murmured softly. “Who do we know with those initials?”</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>Ron shook his head. </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>“We have to search for them,” Harry said. “I’m not going back to Hogwarts next year. This is what Dumbledore asked me to do. It’s the only way to destroy him.”</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>“We’re coming with you,” Hermione said softly. </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">The memory dissolved into the next.</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>Hermione, Harry, and Ron stood with hundreds of other students at Dumbledore’s funeral.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>Hermione felt the grief like a reopened wound, but it was now even more intimate and the pain more fresh.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>Hopelessness sank in as Hermione gazed out over the countless wands lit and lifted aloft in the night. </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>An impossible task, and to do it without guidance from their mentor… Dumbledore had always been their savior. </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>He knew everything. Everything would be okay as long as they had Albus Dumbledore.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>But the realization that they no longer had him had felt like the numbness of drowning in a frozen lake.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>Hopeless.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>Empty.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>Complete despair.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">Tom withdrew from Hermione’s mind.</p><p dir="ltr">He was looking away from her, out through the window, the light from the street lamp glinting in his black eyes. </p><p dir="ltr">His hand was still coiled in her curls.</p><p dir="ltr">“Dumbledore… dead.”</p><p dir="ltr">He didn’t phrase it as a question; it was a statement void of emotion.</p><p dir="ltr">“Yes,” she whispered.</p><p dir="ltr">His eyes finally slid to meet hers.</p><p dir="ltr">He exhaled as if he’d been holding his breath. </p><p dir="ltr">She tried to gauge his reaction, but whatever he was feeling or thinking was hidden behind the mask of his features, which were blank and controlled.</p><p dir="ltr">He swallowed, cheek muscles tensing as he muttered, “I’ve always hated Dumbledore. You’re aware of that, I assume.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Yes, I know.”</p><p dir="ltr">“There’s something very tragic about knowing a wizard of his calibre is gone… even if it hasn’t happened yet.” He pressed his tongue against the inside of his cheek. “Especially knowing it was me that gave the order.”</p><p dir="ltr">Hermione stayed quiet, deciding it was best to give him time to process.</p><p dir="ltr">He gazed out through the window for some time in complete silence. </p><p dir="ltr">“Do you want to continue?” she asked.</p><p dir="ltr">“If we keep going, you’ll have a terrible headache tomorrow.”</p><p dir="ltr">“It’s really not that bad. Letting you in willingly makes all the difference.” She laughed softly. “I always thought legilimency had to be painful, but it turns out, that’s only if it’s forced.”</p><p dir="ltr">Tom said nothing as he continued to stare through the window.</p><p dir="ltr">“Tom.”</p><p dir="ltr">Finally, he turned his head to meet her gaze.</p><p dir="ltr">“We don’t have to do this. I’m afraid it will change everything between us… and I don’t want that.”</p><p dir="ltr">He watched her for some time, his expression a mask. It unnerved her, the sudden change in his composure from this morning.</p><p dir="ltr">She had to remind herself that he, too, needed to process the events of the future.</p><p dir="ltr">Perhaps they were as traumatizing for him as they’d been for her.</p><p dir="ltr">But then again… perhaps he was angry with her. Perhaps he’d grow even angrier still, once he knew <em>everything</em>.</p><p dir="ltr">She swallowed. There was no way around it. If he wanted to know the truth, she would show him… even if it meant losing him.</p><p dir="ltr">“I have to know.”</p><p dir="ltr">That was all he said for the rest of the night. </p><p dir="ltr">He was silent as they got ready for bed. </p><p dir="ltr">He was silent as they each brushed their teeth.</p><p dir="ltr">He was silent with his back turned to her as he laid out his clothing for the next day.</p><p dir="ltr">She watched him from the bed, his back muscles rippling as he finished his ritual, placing his shoes beneath the chair. His yew wand was still in hand and he waved it, plunging them into darkness.</p><p dir="ltr">She felt the bed dip beneath his weight, and then she sensed his body heat as he lay down next to her.</p><p dir="ltr">She listened to his even breathing for a moment, fearing that he would shun her all night, but to her relief, he moved and she felt his arms slip around her from behind, pulling her back against his chest as he did each night.</p><p dir="ltr">He said nothing, but it was enough to bring her a measure of relief. </p><p dir="ltr">She was much more exhausted from the legilimency than she had thought at first, and she quickly fell into a deep sleep.</p><p> </p><p dir="ltr">———————-</p><p> </p><p dir="ltr">
<em>Hermione screamed.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>Once again, Tom was running. He’d never run so quickly in his life, through the corridors of Hogwarts. </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>His heart nearly failed him as he caught a glimpse of her, but he had to wait for the staircase to move.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>She fled as if attempting to escape something.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>The moment the staircase was close enough, Tom leapt onto its stone steps and took them three at a time.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>He shouted her name, but she disappeared into the third floor corridor.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>He was so close.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>Tom’s heart pounded, adrenaline coursing through his veins. His magic crackled on the surface of his skin like a forcefield, energy threading itself between his fingertips, ready to be unleashed.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>Tom whirled around the corner, but Hermione wasn’t there.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>He heard the hiss of a serpent, the sound of parseltongue, but Tom couldn’t make out what was said.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>Suddenly, all around him, smoke rolled in like clouds. He squinted his eyes, attempting to see through the fog.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>“Hermione!” he shouted.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>A sinister laugh rang out through the corridor, a deep and guttural sound.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>Then, as the smoke cleared, Tom was faced with a man he was sure he’d seen before.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>Shoulder length black hair, an aquiline nose, tanned olive skin, and red eyes, their pupils slitted like those of a serpent. </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>He was a tall, imposing figure, about Tom’s height.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>“Give it back, Tom Riddle, and I’ll give her back.”</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>The man’s voice was laced with acid and contempt.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>Tom said nothing, trying to decipher precisely who the figure was. It was there, in his mind, but the information was locked away and he didn’t have the key…</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>… as if it were withheld from him on purpose.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>Tom’s eyes narrowed, and he took a step forward, his hand gripping his wand. “Who the fuck are you, and what do you want?”</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>The man laughed. “You’re nothing, boy. I’d show a bit more respect if I were you.”</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>Then the man looked up, and Tom followed his line of sight.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>Tom’s heart fell into his stomach.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>Hermione was wrapped in a full body bind and floating high above them, near the ceiling. </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>Tom’s eyes widened and he lifted his wand.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>“Ah, ah,” the man warned. The wizard lifted his hand aloft and suddenly Hermione’s body began to bend.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>Tom watched, frozen in horror as her body bent backward, and he heard her spine snap like a twig. </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>Tom’s roar of rage echoed through the hall.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">Tom jumped up, kicking the sheet away as he gasped for breath. </p><p dir="ltr">He quickly turned, planting his feet on the floor as he dropped his head into his hands. Sweat trickled down his spine between his shoulder blades.</p><p dir="ltr">He swallowed, feeling the violent beating of his heart in his throat.</p><p dir="ltr">“Fuck,” he choked out, nausea rising up from his stomach. He lowered his head between his knees to curb the sensation.</p><p dir="ltr">He listened, but there was nothing but silence, and the rapid thudding of his heartbeat. He turned to find Hermione still asleep. </p><p dir="ltr">Tom stood, needing to do something, unable to sit still, anxiety tight in his muscles like a constricting asp.</p><p dir="ltr">He escaped to the sitting room, flicking his wand to light the lamp. It cast an eerie glow over the room through its viridian glass shade.</p><p dir="ltr">He stood in the dim green light, his skin crawling.</p><p dir="ltr">Something was there… or someone.</p><p dir="ltr">He whirled around, but he could see nothing.</p><p dir="ltr">He wondered vaguely if he were to separate his soul from his body, would he find some spirit lingering?</p><p dir="ltr">Something sinister was haunting his dreams.</p><p dir="ltr">“Who are you and what do you want?” he asked the air.</p><p dir="ltr">There was a flicker of the lamplight, but no sound.</p><p dir="ltr">He hadn’t felt such sickening paranoia since he’d killed Myrtle Warren.</p><p dir="ltr">He’d felt nauseous when he realized Dumbledore suspected him, and it had driven him to seal up the chamber. </p><p dir="ltr">This was a different sort of fear.</p><p dir="ltr">Tom sat in his armchair and braced his elbows on his knees to run his fingers through his hair.</p><p dir="ltr">He needed to learn, to expand his magical repertoire. </p><p dir="ltr">He needed more <em>power</em>.</p><p dir="ltr">He craved to know the deep, arcane secrets of magic, the ones few others understood.</p><p dir="ltr">Then, he told himself, he’d be the most powerful wizard in the world. </p><p dir="ltr">He felt more ruthlessly driven than he’d ever been.</p><p>Tom had always thought that to fall in love would make a man dull and weak, but he was steadily realizing that his love for Hermione had somehow made him sharper, more wary. He was coiled like a viper, laying in wait, Hermione’s face always  present in his mind, guiding him, motivating him.</p><p dir="ltr">Before he met Hermione, he’d craved influence and magical strength, his fear of the afterlife pushing him to seek immortality. </p><p dir="ltr">He cared little for his soul, or his appearance, never concerned with the implications of his actions as long as his goals could be accomplished.</p><p dir="ltr">But now… now Tom had something he feared to lose…</p><p dir="ltr">…and her chest bore the marks of his very own curse.</p><p dir="ltr">Tom thought of the version of himself he’d seen in Hermione’s memories.</p><p dir="ltr">A thin, pallid wraith, his red eyes crazed and brutal. His voice, a high-pitched rasp. </p><p dir="ltr">What had caused him to take such a form? Was that form the embodiment of his soul, or had the creation of such a number of horcruxes caused his appearance to fracture?</p><p dir="ltr">Perhaps he was so imbued with dark magic at that point that there was no returning to his former self.</p><p dir="ltr">Tom felt torn. He was horrified by the pain he’d inflicted upon Hermione, and disgusted with the obvious oversights and miscalculations he had made… but he was still impressed with his own magical skill and accomplishments.</p><p dir="ltr">He thought of her friend, Harry.</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>The Chosen One.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">A parselmouth, and somehow connected to Voldemort’s own mind.</p><p dir="ltr">Tom already knew how. He put it together early on, as soon as it was revealed the boy was a parselmouth.</p><p dir="ltr">Tom realized he’d made such grave mistakes, he could hardly process the shock of it.</p><p dir="ltr">He’d arrogantly thought he could circumvent prophecy. He’d been foolish to think he could stash his horcrux in the hidden room at Hogwarts…</p><p dir="ltr">Dumbledore had uncovered his motivations and deciphered his secrets… even his hiding place in the cave, which he’d so carefully planned out. </p><p dir="ltr"><em>I should’ve killed Dumbledore,</em> he thought wryly. </p><p dir="ltr">Dumbledore was the only wizard he’d ever feared.</p><p dir="ltr">But then again, someone had discovered his horcrux even before Dumbledore had.</p><p dir="ltr">The thought made Tom’s stomach turn.</p><p dir="ltr">Tom was desperately curious about this locket, but decided against searching for it.</p><p dir="ltr">It had no relevance now, and Tom didn’t need any temptation. </p><p dir="ltr">He’d made an oath… no more horcruxes would be created…</p><p dir="ltr">… save one, and he already knew what it would be.</p><p dir="ltr">Tom sat back in his chair, his forearms planted on either side as he fell into deep thought.</p><p dir="ltr">He would have to find another route to power. Hermione was right… many of his followers would defect once they realized his loyalties had shifted.</p><p dir="ltr">They potentially already had. He’d had enough warning dreams and could sense the unrest among their ranks.</p><p dir="ltr">Tom took his cigarette case from the side table and lit one. The end flickered and blazed a bright scarlet in the darkness.</p><p dir="ltr">He was desperate to know the rest of her memories, but he dreaded the self-inflicted wounds he would sustain by learning how his actions had affected Hermione.</p><p dir="ltr">Not only then, but now.</p><p dir="ltr">No wonder she had feared him. No wonder she’d nearly overdosed on potions.</p><p dir="ltr">She’d finally been free of him, only to be thrown back into a reality where her worst fears existed once again.</p><p dir="ltr">Tom was completely staggered by the fact that she’d surrendered to him, had let him kiss her in Godric’s Hollow, had come to him night after night for months… had been intimate with him, all the while knowing what he was and who he would become.</p><p dir="ltr">The overwhelming guilt he’d sensed on the night she overdosed made so much sense now.</p><p dir="ltr">Tom’s chest tightened with an unfamiliar ache.</p><p dir="ltr">Dumbledore’s words rang with clarity in Tom’s mind.</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>Perhaps we are both being given another chance, Tom.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">Tom realized that his path was diverging sharply; it had been ever since Hermione Granger stepped into his world. </p><p dir="ltr">He had the vague feeling of his dreams being crushed, but the practical side of him knew that wasn’t the case.</p><p dir="ltr">He had overplayed his hand. He had underestimated his enemies. He had chosen followers he could not trust. He had coveted immortality, yet barely lived past 72 years of age.</p><p dir="ltr">Foolish, that’s what he had been.</p><p dir="ltr">His arrogance had blinded him at every turn. </p><p dir="ltr">The reality was that Tom Riddle was utterly embarrassed.</p><p dir="ltr">So what if he’d been the most powerful wizard to walk the earth? So what if he’d injected fear into the hearts of every citizen of magical Britain?</p><p dir="ltr">He’d <em>failed</em>. That’s all that mattered to Tom.</p><p dir="ltr">He did not like the feeling. It made him want to burn London to the ground.</p><p dir="ltr">He leaned back, gazing up at the ceiling as he brought the cigarette back to his lips. He sucked in a deep drag, letting the smoke crowd his lungs.</p><p dir="ltr">His mind was acting up again.</p><p dir="ltr">The smoke curled in the air like the mysterious fog in his dream.</p><p dir="ltr">Rather than dwell on his failures, he shifted his thoughts to <em>her</em>.</p><p dir="ltr">Hermione Granger would help him… of that, he was certain.</p><p dir="ltr">Tom closed his eyes.</p><p dir="ltr">She was his other half, was she not? Fate had brought her to him. She was the light to his darkness, the balance he craved. </p><p dir="ltr">Surely she could open his eyes to see the things he hadn’t seen before.</p><p dir="ltr">But Tom couldn’t help the sinking dread in his gut, something that told him she was in danger. </p><p dir="ltr">The premonitions crawled along his skin, pricking like a thousand tiny needles.</p><p dir="ltr">He felt uneasy.</p><p dir="ltr">When Tom Riddle felt uneasy, he was at his most dangerous.</p><p dir="ltr">He leaned back and closed his eyes, lifting the almost depleted cigarette to his lips for one more drag. He saw Hermione’s scar on the back of his eyelids, long and grisly, spanning diagonally across her chest.</p><p dir="ltr">“You’ve left marks upon me too, little witch,” he breathed as smoke poured from his lips. “Mine are just invisible.”</p><p dir="ltr">He thought of the scar etched into Hermione’s arm.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Mudblood</em>.</p><p dir="ltr">Tom had already dreamed up a very painful death for the person who had caused it, no matter how long he had to wait.</p><p dir="ltr">Tomorrow he would find out for certain who it was.</p><p dir="ltr">He sat there for the rest of the night without rest, his mind examining each memory, every wrong move he had made, every single emotion his witch had experienced.</p><p dir="ltr">Tom Riddle was determined to right his wrongs.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">—————</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">The next morning, Hermione was quiet as she drank her tea. </p><p dir="ltr">Tom was perusing a book on blood magic as if nothing irregular had occurred. </p><p dir="ltr">It was driving her crazy, his lack of reaction, but she decided that giving him space was the best course of action… even if it stressed her beyond comprehension.</p><p dir="ltr">In order to get her mind off of where his thoughts lay, she got dressed and decided to go and check in on the factory.</p><p dir="ltr">He gripped her chin and kissed her before she left. Hermione cleared her throat as she opened the door of his flat. “Um… did you want to continue tonight, then?”</p><p dir="ltr">“I won’t be in London tonight. I have a bit of business to take care of. Tomorrow evening I’ll return… we can continue then.”</p><p dir="ltr">Hermione swallowed, then dipped her head in disappointment. “Oh.”</p><p dir="ltr">Tom placed two fingers beneath her chin, forcing her eyes to meet his. “I’ll be back tomorrow evening, love. Be a good girl while I’m gone.”</p><p dir="ltr">He kissed her again, and then she left, feeling confused. </p><p dir="ltr">Why did it feel as if the more she revealed, the more secrets there seemed to be between them?</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">——————</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">Tom stepped through the floo into the Malfoy Manor library. </p><p dir="ltr">He was in the business of tying up loose ends today and wouldn’t let himself be distracted. </p><p dir="ltr">He left the library and went straight to the drawing room, where he found Abraxas sitting down to tea with his mother and Walburga Black. </p><p dir="ltr">Abraxas cleared his throat and stood, smoothing his robes as he excused himself. The Malfoy matriarch cocked a brow as she eyed Tom disapprovingly.</p><p dir="ltr">He met Tom in the hallway. </p><p dir="ltr">“My Lord, to what do I owe this visit?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Outside, Malfoy.”</p><p dir="ltr">Abraxas bowed his head in a noble manner as he followed Tom out into the gardens.</p><p dir="ltr">Tom whirled around. “Why is Walburga here?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Ahem,” Malfoy hedged, clearing his throat nervously. “She is good friends with my mother, as you know.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Is that the reason she’s here?”</p><p dir="ltr">Malfoy gave Tom a tight smile. “Well, no… she’s here to see Dolohov.”</p><p dir="ltr">Tom froze, pinning Abraxas with an unblinking stare. “He’s supposed to be in Albania.”</p><p dir="ltr">“He refused to go.”</p><p dir="ltr">“So you’ve kept him here?”</p><p dir="ltr">“I would’ve told you sooner, but it seemed you were… otherwise occupied.”</p><p dir="ltr">Tom cocked his head, glaring at Malfoy through narrowed eyes. “What do you mean by that?”</p><p dir="ltr">“We were all rather surprised to hear of your engagement. Is it true?”</p><p dir="ltr">Tom paused, then answered icily, “Of course.”</p><p dir="ltr">Abraxas’ eyebrows shot up. “I had no idea the two of you were involved to such a degree. I thought perhaps, maybe a carnal interest. Is this some part of your elaborate plan? A way to get to Dumbledore, perhaps?”</p><p dir="ltr">Tom smirked. “I would think you’d be thrilled, seeing as you’ve admitted to caring for Miss Dumbledore. As it stands, my interest in Hermione is my own business.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Oh, certainly, my Lord. It is hard not to care for her. She is a charming witch, as you know. Only I’m a bit shocked. She doesn’t share our beliefs… nor does she keep to our standards. Her convictions are quite opposite from our own.”</p><p dir="ltr">“What are you trying to say, Malfoy? Enough of your bloody aristocratic drivel. Spit it out.”</p><p dir="ltr">Abraxas took a deep breath, then his blue-gray eyes met Tom’s. “I don’t know how to say it, my Lord. The others don’t understand your actions. To say they’re upset would be an understatement.”</p><p dir="ltr">“And what, pray tell, do they plan to do about it?”</p><p dir="ltr">Malfoy averted his eyes, clearly uncomfortable. “Well, nothing, of course. None could stand against you, and none would dare to try. However, it seems there might be… a splitting of ways, perhaps? Amicably, of course.” He looked back to Tom. “It’s not just your engagement. It’s the talk of pureblood numbers dying out. It’s Rosier and Dolohov being imprisoned. Morale is low. Everyone is… uneasy.”</p><p dir="ltr">Tom smiled ominously, his eyes flashing red. “You all took the mark. My mark. There is no splitting of ways.”</p><p dir="ltr">“My Lord, the issue of blood purity-“</p><p dir="ltr">“Blood supremacy is a joke, Malfoy. I would hope you’d be a bit more intelligent than to buy into that charade. Or have you forgotten that your blood isn’t as pure as you and your family claim that it is?”</p><p dir="ltr">Malfoy’s eyes darkened perceptibly. “That, my Lord, has not been proven. How can you be so sure it’s as you say, a joke? Are you certain your mind hasn’t been poisoned by her-“</p><p dir="ltr">“If you continue to speak, Malfoy, I shall have your tongue.”</p><p dir="ltr">Tom’s eyes were a deep red, and the atmosphere in the garden where they stood had taken on a foreboding milieu. Even the sky seemed to darken, the clouds gray and dreary when they had moments ago seemed bright and cheery.</p><p dir="ltr">“Forgive me, my Lord. I should really be congratulating you on your engagement. Hermione is a powerful and influential witch, and it is an advantageous match for the both of you. We all believe you to be a power to rival Grindelwald, perhaps even Dumbledore himself. You are worthy of our service, and our loyalty… but there are some things even I will not question, and one of them is the power and anciency of our blood.” He reached up and placed a hand on Tom’s shoulder as if they were still the same Slytherin comrades they had been in their school days. “Magic is Might, my old friend.”</p><p dir="ltr">Tom’s eyes cut coldly to the offending hand placed on his shoulder. A moment later, Malfoy lifted it nervously.</p><p dir="ltr">“Where is Dolohov?” Tom demanded.</p><p dir="ltr">Malfoy inclined his head. “I’ll take you to him.”</p><p dir="ltr">Tom followed as Abraxas led him down into the dungeons.</p><p dir="ltr">“You’ve kept him here all this time?” Tom asked in irritation as they entered the deep, dark labyrinth of corridors beneath the manor. “You’re lucky he wasn’t found.”</p><p dir="ltr">“These dungeons are protected by old enchantments. The ministry searched but found nothing. He’s as safe here as anywhere.”</p><p dir="ltr">“He isn’t safe from me,” Tom threatened.</p><p dir="ltr">As soon as the door to his vault opened, Tom whipped his wand and Dolohov was thrown back against the wall where he stayed pinned as Tom strode up to him and gripped him by the throat.</p><p dir="ltr">“I’m moments away from killing you,” he spat. His eyes roamed his death eater, taking in his much thinner appearance.</p><p dir="ltr">“You promised Walburga,” Dolohov winced, trying to swallow against the pressure round his windpipe. </p><p dir="ltr">“I promised I’d get you out safely. I never said I wouldn’t kill you after.”</p><p dir="ltr">“She promised you the loyalty of the Blacks,” he rasped. </p><p dir="ltr">Tom leaned forward, his red eyes boring into Dolohov’s. “And I will have it, with or without you.”</p><p dir="ltr">Silence stretched as Tom performed legilimency. </p><p dir="ltr">When he was done, Dolohov probed, “Malfoy said Rosier will be acquitted.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Yes.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Is there hope that I’ll also be acquitted?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Do you think you deserve it?”</p><p dir="ltr">Dolohov swallowed. “I made a mistake, my Lord.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Indeed.”</p><p dir="ltr">“I can still be useful.”</p><p dir="ltr">Tom scoffed, his red eyes flaring brightly. “Always in need of rescue.” He clicked his tongue. “You’ve outlived your usefulness, Max. I told you that you were out, and I meant it. Be thankful that you still have your life.” He looked Dolohov up and down disdainfully, then turned to Malfoy. “Keep him here if you think it’s safe, at your own risk. Otherwise, I’ll take him to Albania tonight.” </p><p dir="ltr">Dolohov cast a panicked look at Abraxas, who rolled his eyes and nodded. “I’ll keep him here… for now.”</p><p dir="ltr">Tom gave a curt nod and gestured for Abraxas to follow. “Come. We need to discuss Rosier’s trial. You’ll have to assert your influence over the Wizengamot.”</p><p dir="ltr">Malfoy followed Tom from the room and the vault clanged shut behind them, its myriad locks clicking magically into place as they walked down the corridor.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">———————-</p><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Tom didn’t return the following night.</p><p dir="ltr">Hermione didn’t see him the night after either.</p><p dir="ltr">She also spent the following night alone.</p><p dir="ltr">For three whole days and nights, she was driven mad with worry.</p><p dir="ltr">The first day, she busied herself with business at the factory, until Winnie finally sent her home, claiming she was a neurotic disaster and needed some rest.</p><p dir="ltr">The second day, she met with the house elves of Acheron Place and had her lawyer draft contracts of employment for them all. Then she returned home where she baked scones and then kept her mind occupied with her books.</p><p dir="ltr">The third day, she devolved into a nervous wreck. She checked the parchment which he often wrote to her on, but it was empty. She then apparated to his flat, but found it exactly as they’d both left it. She used to stay there whenever Tom was out of the country, but she suddenly found it terribly cold and lonely in his absence. </p><p dir="ltr">She was used to living alone, but given the way he had left, in stoic silence, along with his promise to return the following night which he had now broken, Hermione couldn’t help but be anxious. She took dreamless sleep potion to curb her fear…</p><p dir="ltr">Fear that something terrible had happened to him. </p><p dir="ltr">Fear that he might be second-guessing their engagement.</p><p dir="ltr">Fear that Voldemort was taking him over. </p><p dir="ltr">Fear that she wasn’t enough to help him, that he couldn’t really change, when everything was all said and done.</p><p dir="ltr">She began to wonder if she’d been out of her mind this entire time, blinded by her feelings.</p><p dir="ltr">Her mind ran rampant until the potion silenced her troubled thoughts.</p><p dir="ltr">The next day, she didn’t leave her flat. She busied herself with cleaning, and then she began to box up all of her belongings, preparing to move to their new home in Oxfordshire.</p><p dir="ltr">“He will come,” she whispered to herself throughout the day. “We will move into that house, so I must get ready.”</p><p dir="ltr">She began to drink around five o’ clock in the evening, downing nearly an entire bottle of strong, elf-made wine.</p><p dir="ltr">Finally, around 8pm, while she was sitting on her velvet sofa in a silk camisole, wine bottle in hand, there came a soft clap in her sitting room and there he stood, dressed all in black in the center of the room.</p><p dir="ltr">He bent over, hands on his knees, head hung down as if he were nauseous for a few moments. Then slowly, he stood, gazing down at her.</p><p dir="ltr">Hermione glared at him for several moments before she suddenly leapt up from the couch, slammed the wine bottle onto the coffee table and stalked down the hallway to her bedroom, stomping her bare feet along the hardwood floor. </p><p dir="ltr">“I hate you!” she shouted, before slamming the door.</p><p dir="ltr">All was quiet for a few moments. </p><p dir="ltr">Just as she began to wonder if he might have left, her door crashed open, wood splintering as Tom burst into the room, nearly knocking the door off its hinges.</p><p dir="ltr">“Care to repeat that?” he asked seriously.</p><p dir="ltr">“You heard me!” she replied petulantly, her words slurring together.</p><p dir="ltr">His eyes narrowed as he watched her. “Are you drunk?”</p><p dir="ltr">“It’s none of your concern, you arse.”</p><p dir="ltr">His jaw muscles tensed, betraying his frustration. </p><p dir="ltr">He moved slowly closer, moving from one side to another in the manner of a serpent. </p><p dir="ltr">She lifted her wand. “Don’t you dare come any closer.”</p><p dir="ltr">Tom’s lips twitched. “You really want to duel me before I fuck you? You enjoy rather strange types of foreplay, my dear.”</p><p dir="ltr">He moved closer, but she backed away a step. “Don’t make me hex you, Tom.”</p><p dir="ltr">He cocked his head. </p><p dir="ltr">In a movement swifter than any viper, he slid his wand from his pocket and disarmed her. “Drinking causes a delayed reaction, darling. You’re slow anyway, but add the wine on top-“</p><p dir="ltr">“Do you really think insulting me is going to help the situation?”</p><p dir="ltr">“I’m more than willing to train you to draw your wand quicker.”</p><p dir="ltr">“How generous of you,” she retorted acidly.</p><p dir="ltr">He watched her, his eyes narrowed. “Care to tell me why I’ve come home to such a chilly reception?”</p><p dir="ltr">Hermione glared at him. “Why don’t you go back to your flat and think about it for a few days? I think four days would suffice.”</p><p dir="ltr">Tom lips curled into a smile as he slowly removed his robes and began to loosen his tie. “Oh no, I’m not going to do that, love.”</p><p dir="ltr">“No?”</p><p dir="ltr">“No. I’m going to fuck you because I haven’t seen you for nearly four days.” His eyes slid down the length of her body. “And because I’ve thought of nothing else since I left.”</p><p dir="ltr">Hermione arched a brow and crossed her arms over her chest. “That certainly is an unfortunate misunderstanding on your part, because I will not be sleeping with you tonight.”</p><p dir="ltr">His black eyes met hers, and he took a step forward. “Is that so?”</p><p dir="ltr">“It is.” She took a step back.</p><p dir="ltr">“Did it not occur to you that I might not have intended to be gone longer than I originally promised you? You’ve never been angry when I was gone before.”</p><p dir="ltr">“You were entitled to your secrets then. But now you’ve no excuse. All you do is ask me for mine without sharing yours in return.”</p><p dir="ltr">His eyes narrowed. “You think I’m hiding things from you?”</p><p dir="ltr">“It doesn’t matter. You could’ve said something but I didn’t hear a word from you for four days.”</p><p dir="ltr">Tom blinked as if utterly stunned by her reaction.</p><p dir="ltr">She looked away. “I’m too angry to speak with you tonight.”</p><p dir="ltr">Tom cocked his jaw to the side, then ran his tongue over his teeth. “Very well.”</p><p dir="ltr">He stood back and a moment later, he disapparated.</p><p dir="ltr">Hermione stood there staring at the place where he’d just stood, every bit as stunned by his reaction as he’d been by hers.</p><p dir="ltr">She lifted her hand to cover her mouth and tears filled her eyes. A sob broke free, escaping from her throat as the tears spilled over her eyes, wetting her lashes.</p><p dir="ltr">She sobbed hysterically for several moments, entirely unsure why she was crying.</p><p dir="ltr">Perhaps it was finally sinking in how terrified she was.</p><p dir="ltr">Because Tom Riddle was the most dangerous person in Great Britain, and because she loved him very deeply, and because he possessed the infinite capacity to hurt her.</p><p dir="ltr">He could hurt her with so little effort, could bring her low with only a few choice words.</p><p dir="ltr">Hermione had hoped that following the war, she could become an armored fortress, incapable of ever being hurt again.</p><p dir="ltr">How foolish she had been!</p><p dir="ltr">The brightest witch of her age?</p><p dir="ltr">No. She was a lovestruck, weak girl. How dare she think she could be Minister for Magic over all of Britain?</p><p dir="ltr">Hermione stood in her misery, spiraling over something so small, yet so large.</p><p dir="ltr">She’d let him in and made herself vulnerable, yet he couldn’t even do her the courtesy of checking in.</p><p dir="ltr">The tears didn’t stop coming. She didn’t try to stop them. Her fears and anxiety that had built up for the past four days bubbled over, with no way to stop them.</p><p dir="ltr">Just as Hermione was on the verge of retrieving another vial of dreamless sleep, a loud clap sounded from the center of her room. </p><p dir="ltr">She looked up to find Tom standing before her.</p><p dir="ltr">“No,” he said with a shaking of his head. “Fuck this.”</p><p dir="ltr">In two strides he met her and slid his hand behind her head, pulling her to him. He devoured her in a bruising kiss, prying her lips apart with his tongue, tasting her salty tears where they trickled down to the joining of their mouths.</p><p dir="ltr">Hermione’s heart raced as his scent surrounded her. She didn’t move for a moment due to shock, but soon she began to respond to him with eagerness.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>This</em>. This was what she wanted.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>He</em> was what she needed. She’d craved him for the past four days like a starving woman.</p><p dir="ltr">What had he done to her?</p><p dir="ltr">She moaned against his lips, prompting him to break the kiss long enough to bend and lift her into his arms. He tossed her onto the bed behind them and climbed over her, lowering his mouth to hers once more.</p><p dir="ltr">“No more tears, little witch,” he breathed against her lips. “You’ve wept enough.”</p><p dir="ltr">He slid her thin nightgown up, baring her thighs. He hooked his thumb around her knee and lifted her leg to press his lips to the inside of her thigh. </p><p dir="ltr">“Give me a date, witch,” he muttered.</p><p dir="ltr">“A date?” she asked breathlessly.</p><p dir="ltr">“For our wedding. The sooner the better.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Oh,” she murmured, surprised. “I’d marry you tomorrow.”</p><p dir="ltr">He chuckled under his breath. “As would I, but I think you’d better give Britain the grand wedding they all think they deserve, being their premier socialite.”</p><p dir="ltr">She swallowed as he vanished her knickers. “Right.”</p><p dir="ltr">He kissed her chest, then slid his tongue over her nipple, through the fabric of her camisole. He took her nipple between his teeth and rolled it, teasing her until she was writhing beneath him, every ounce of her anger slowly dissolving.</p><p dir="ltr">Her heart thundered against her ribs. “Do you even realize what you’ve done to me, Tom Riddle?”</p><p dir="ltr">He tugged on her other nipple with his teeth as his middle finger brushed against her heat. “Nothing that you haven’t also done to me many times over.”</p><p dir="ltr">A choking sensation rose up in her chest and throat. “You terrify me. I was so worried about you.”</p><p dir="ltr">He paused his ministrations, lifting himself up onto his arms above her to gaze into her eyes. “You once told me, here in this very bed, that I terrified you… only then, you meant Voldemort. I suppose now it's an entirely different kind of fear, but I assure you, it is a fear that neither of us are exempt from.” He lowered his face until his breath fell against her ear, then whispered, “You terrify me as well, little witch.”</p><p dir="ltr">Hermione reached out a hand and gently brushed his inky black curls from his forehead. “I’m afraid of how much I love you… and how easily you can hurt me.”</p><p dir="ltr">“I would sooner snap my own wand than hurt you, Hermione. I long for the day when you’ll realize that and accept it as truth.”</p><p dir="ltr">She placed her hands on either side of his face and pulled his mouth down to hers. He kissed her hungrily, their joint lust becoming a fever and climbing higher. Her fingers began to work swiftly to unbutton his shirt. He leaned back just long enough to slip it off, revealing his bare chest with its strange runes. Hermione sat up only to pull his mouth back to hers.</p><p dir="ltr">He reached between them and unbuckled his belt. Hermione gasped as she came up for air, a desperate ache growing in her core as the cold metal of his belt brushed against her bare flesh.</p><p dir="ltr">Tears spilled onto her cheeks, causing his brows to draw forward sharply. “I missed you,” she muttered, abashed. “I’m sorry. I don’t know what’s wrong with me.”</p><p dir="ltr">She felt his hardness between her legs, his length sliding along the wetness of her entrance. </p><p dir="ltr">“You’re mine, Hermione,” he muttered into her ear. “You were mine when we first met. You’re mine now.” </p><p dir="ltr">He entered her in one sharp thrust, causing Hermione to issue a soft cry. </p><p dir="ltr">“You’ll be mine when we wed,” he continued, “and you’ll be mine when we complete the soul bond. You’ve always been mine, even though time and space separated us.” </p><p dir="ltr">He filled her in rapid thrusts and she met them with a fervor of her own, each chasing something, both taking and giving, each begging and bestowing. </p><p dir="ltr">“I created a way to bring you, and you came to me, without even knowing why you came. I dreamt of you before you ever appeared. You’re mine. I think you might have known it from the start.” </p><p dir="ltr">His eyes raked her body, his large hands tracing her curves. “And your body… it might as well be a horcrux, because your soul is half of my own.”</p><p dir="ltr">Tom eyes combed her, admiring her warm brown pin curls fanned out over the bedspread, her cheeks and lips swollen and stained with tears, glowing skin contrasted with the cream lace and lavender silk of her chemise.</p><p dir="ltr">He thrust harder, pushing her legs further apart. He had worked up a sheen of sweat which glistened on his pale chest. Hermione’s fingers fluttered over his shoulders, following the dips and crests of his biceps, tracing the contours of his abdominal muscles. </p><p dir="ltr">“<em>Oh</em>!” Hermione whimpered as he stroked a spot within her that sent shockwaves of pleasure through her entire body. “Oh, <em>Merlin</em>, right <em>there</em>. Yes!”</p><p dir="ltr">He held her legs steady and maintained his rhythm, fucking her deep and hard.</p><p dir="ltr">She threw her head back, arching against him as a tantalizing pressure built in her core. “<em>Oh</em>,” she moaned. “Tom, yes… oh my <em>gods</em>.”</p><p dir="ltr">Tom smirked above her, bracing himself on his arms which flexed from the effort, his muscles bulging as he gave and gave, pushing her higher and farther, lifting her into another realm altogether. “That’s my perfect witch,” he breathed. “I love it when you beg for more.”</p><p dir="ltr">Her chest began to flush as she held her breath, and he grinned as he felt her toes curling against his calf muscles. </p><p dir="ltr">Suddenly, in the throes of passion, Tom was beset by a desire that was unfamiliar to him. It was irrational and uncomfortable, but he couldn’t shake it once it entered his mind.</p><p dir="ltr">It drove his lust wild, and he felt himself hardening. </p><p dir="ltr">He shook his head and closed his eyes, slowing his thrusts in an attempt to stem his urges.</p><p dir="ltr">“What’s wrong?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Nothing,” he said quickly.</p><p dir="ltr">He focused, trying to push the image out of his mind.</p><p dir="ltr">As much as he occluded, the sight wouldn’t disappear. </p><p dir="ltr">In his mind, he saw Hermione as she was now, but her stomach was round and growing with his child.</p><p dir="ltr">The image both repulsed Tom and simultaneously drove him mad, turning him into a raving beast hellbent on filling her with his spend.</p><p dir="ltr">He shook his head in desperation to be rid of the vision.</p><p dir="ltr">“Tom, what is it?”</p><p dir="ltr">He shook his head again. “Come, Hermione. Let me watch you.”</p><p dir="ltr">She was close. Her chest had flushed a violent red and her legs were trembling.</p><p dir="ltr">He shifted her weight, lifting her leg so that he could fill her even deeper, and within moments she was gone, her body racked with tremors as she released a breathless moan, her mouth wide open as her orgasm rocketed through her. </p><p dir="ltr">Tom grinned as he continued to move in and out, feeling her walls pulsing around him. He leaned over her, letting his spit drip from his tongue into her open mouth. “Swallow,” he commanded, and she obeyed. He admired the slender column of her throat as it bobbed.</p><p dir="ltr">“Fuck,” he muttered. His cock hardened with each thrust, his eyes roving over her appearance, snatching up every detail in slow motion. The image came back, and in his lust-filled frenzy, trapped in the height of passion, Tom found that he couldn’t banish it. “Fuck’s sake,” he whispered in frustration.</p><p dir="ltr">The thought of Hermione, no longer a secret lover, but as his wife in the eyes of the world, pregnant with his child, a scene flashed before his eyes and he found that although it was a thought he’d never found even remotely appealing, it now sent him over the edge. </p><p dir="ltr">As he exploded inside her, pumping her full of his cum, Hermione looked up and her eyes met his, and suddenly he felt her magic penetrate his mind. </p><p dir="ltr">“Legilimens,” she whispered. </p><p dir="ltr">His length throbbed, his body uncoiling, giving him no ability to fight her in that moment, paralyzed as he was by pleasure.</p><p dir="ltr">“No,” he rasped, his heart beating thunderously, but it was too late.</p><p dir="ltr">He closed his eyes and pushed her out of his consciousness, but she’d already witnessed the scene that had overtaken his mind. </p><p dir="ltr">Tom exhaled shakily, and their eyes met. </p><p dir="ltr">Her lips parted, eyes round and full of surprise.</p><p dir="ltr">His jaw flexed, and as if to make a point, he reached for his wand and proceeded to cast a contraception charm.</p><p dir="ltr">Hermione rubbed her lips together. </p><p dir="ltr">His eyes narrowed. “That was not fair.”</p><p dir="ltr">She bit her lip. “Okay. Yes, you’re right… but to my credit, I'm tired of you keeping secrets, and a breeding kink was the last thing that I expected.”</p><p dir="ltr">Tom’s eyes fell shut, and he reached up to pinch the bridge of his nose. He sighed and pulled out of her, rolling away onto his back as he began to feel for his case of cigarettes. “In all honesty, it was also the last thing that I expected,” he confessed.</p><p dir="ltr">Hermione turned onto her side and began to trace her fingers through the light hair on his chest. “Christmas Day.”</p><p dir="ltr">He cocked an eyebrow. “Come again?”</p><p dir="ltr">“You asked me for a date. Christmas.”</p><p dir="ltr">Tom blinked several times, then lifted a cigarette to his lips which he lit wandlessly. “Why Christmas?”</p><p dir="ltr">She rested her chin on his chest as she considered. “Well, it’s not too far away… and you said you always hated Christmas, so it would give us a chance to make better memories on the day. I have good memories of Christmas, especially last Christmas, with Dumbledore, and with you.” Her cheeks turned bright pink as her eyes flicked to the fur rug in front of her fireplace.</p><p dir="ltr">The corners of Tom’s lips turned up slightly. “Alright then. Christmas.”</p><p dir="ltr">“It would be dreamy, don’t you think? And you’d never forget our anniversary. Besides,” she snickered. “Your birthday is New Year’s Eve, so we’d be on our honeymoon then. You do remember last New Year’s Eve, don’t you?”</p><p dir="ltr">He smirked as he exhaled smoke. “How could I ever forget fucking you beneath the Paris fireworks?” He cut his eyes to her, tonguing his incisors. “Shall we make that a tradition?”</p><p dir="ltr">“A new city every year,” she grinned, her whiskey-brown eyes sparkling. “We’ll become international criminals. Exhibitionists of the worst kind, the muggle world’s worst nightmare.”</p><p dir="ltr">Tom laughed, and pulled her into his arms, planting a tender kiss on the top of her head.</p>

<p>Maximillian Dolohov, Abraxas Malfoy, and Walburga Black sat like the points of a triangle at the Blackwood table in the center of the Druidic eye, which was located in the dungeons of Malfoy Manor.</p><p>Otherworldly flames crackled menacingly in the fireplace, seeming to be possessed by a sinister magic from the ancient world.</p><p>“You spoke with him?” Walburga asked. “What did he say?”</p><p>Malfoy sighed. “The engagement is real, <em> and… </em> he called our blood purity standards a joke.”</p><p>Walburga gasped. “I don’t believe it.”</p><p>“It’s true.”</p><p>A look of disgust bloomed on her face, twisting her red lips into a snarl. “I promised him the <em> loyalty </em> of the Black family!”</p><p>“You should be smarter about the things you pledge from now on,” snapped Malfoy.</p><p>She narrowed her eyes and looked pointedly at his arm. “That’s a bit like the cauldron calling the kettle black, is it not?”</p><p>“I already knew that the engagement was real,” said Dolohov quietly.</p><p>Their eyes cut to him, waiting for him to continue.</p><p>Dolohov sucked in a deep breath. “Tom risked his life to save me-“</p><p>“So that he could have the loyalty of my family, never forget! He doesn’t do anything for anyone unless there’s something in it for him.”</p><p>“Nevertheless,” he continued. “He nearly died. The dementors were performing the kiss. It’s strange because I was with him at Azkaban once before and the dementors never seemed to affect him.” He swallowed. “I saw her. She came out of nowhere and cast the patronus charm… She sent nearly a hundred dementors flying into the night. Then she-“ He flicked his eyes at Walburga. “She helped him. She’s an auror, it was her duty to stop him… or at least she could’ve tried. But instead, she helped me escape.”</p><p>Walburga narrowed her eyes. “You sound as if you might actually admire her now. Are you also falling prey to her poison? Would you like to cast me off and fuck her too?”</p><p>Dolohov arched a brow at her theatrics. “Of course not.”</p><p>“Do not forget that this witch has poisoned Tom with her lies and her disgusting mudblood propaganda. If they marry, he will be gone for good. She cannot be allowed to win this election.”</p><p>Malfoy scoffed. “How do you plan to stop her?”</p><p>Walburga grinned. “I have a plan. Besides, Tom is campaigning also. We simply campaign for him, convince the Wizengamot to pull for him as well… and then we expose Hermione’s secrets to the public. She will lose, and Tom will win. Perhaps he will even be done with her also.”</p><p>Malfoy gripped the head of his cane with one hand, and brushed his blonde hair back with the other. “And how do you plan on doing that?”</p><p>“I searched high and low. I dug very deeply into her past. All roads are dead ends. Someone covered up her past very, very carefully. However…” She took a sip of the dark wine in her crystal goblet. “I came upon something rather interesting in an interview once, Dumbledore mentioned a short-lived summer romance with Hermione’s mother, Eleanor Dagworth-Granger. We all know that to be… <em> surprising </em>.” She arched a brow at the two wizards.</p><p>“Go on, and quickly,” Malfoy interjected.</p><p>“I combed through years worth of records on Eleanor Dagworth-Granger. I found nothing that hinted at her having a daughter, besides a few photographs that seemed to have been transfigured… But, on a hunch, I remembered a potioneers summer camp that Ciggy once attended. It was held in Germany every summer. I checked the logs for the summer that Dumbledore had indicated and it seems that Eleanor was an instructor there that very summer. Dumbledore, on the other hand, was in France at that time, practicing alchemy with Nicolas Flamel.”</p><p>“That doesn’t mean anything.”</p><p>“No? Let’s see… according to her records, Hermione’s birthday is in September… meaning she would’ve been conceived in December of that year… not in the summer.”</p><p>The two wizards locked eyes. </p><p>“What I’m saying, <em> gentlemen </em> , is that their story doesn’t add up. It’s enough to indicate that someone is lying, and where there are lies… there are nearly always <em> dark secrets. </em>”</p><p>“What are you insinuating that we should do about it?” Malfoy questioned. He was uneasy with Tom’s sudden shift in loyalty, but he wasn’t foolish. He and his comrades had taken the mark, pledging their allegiance to Voldemort. That wasn’t a pledge that could be easily broken. </p><p>“<em> I </em> cannot do anything,” she replied, “and it’s unwise for any of you to make a move against her either. I’ve promised Tom that I would keep away from her, and he’s threatened to kill <em> anyone </em> who lifts a finger against her.”</p><p>“So helpful, Walburga, thank you for your useful input,” Abraxas muttered, his voice laced with sarcasm.</p><p>“All we need,” she said slowly, “is a third party to do the dirty work. We needn’t hurt her… yet.” Her lips curled into a smile, like two murderous rose petals. “All we need is access to her memories, either through legilimency or veritaserum, and we will potentially have enough to destroy her. We only need to cast a shadow of doubt about her in the eyes of the public. Perhaps her secrets will even convince Tom to open his eyes. It would be a shame to lose him… The reputation of my family is hanging in the balance now. Besides,” she glanced at them each pointedly, “He is not a wizard that you want to make an enemy of. You will have a difficult time finding another dark lord to rival him.”</p><p>“That’s all well and good, Walburga,” said Dolohov with a shake of his head. “But where do you intend to find this elusive third party? Hermione Dumbledore is the golden girl of magical Britain, and she’s got a good chance of becoming Minister for Magic. How would you find someone daft enough to move against her? I doubt you could pay someone enough gold to do it. She’s Dumbledore’s daughter, mind you.”</p><p>“Who do you have in mind, Miss Black?” asked Malfoy, his penetrating eyes peering at her closely. “Who could possibly dislike Hermione Dumbledore enough to do something so drastic and dangerous?”</p><p>Walburga wrapped her pale fingers, with their dark maroon nails, around the wine glass and lifted it in a toast. Her lips turned up in a mysterious smile, and she answered, “The goblins.”</p><p> </p><p>———————</p><p> </p><p>Tom and Hermione spent the day packing their things in preparation to move into their new home. Tom had preferred to wait until the wedding, but Hermione was eager to make it their own.</p><p>“We already spend our nights together. Why should we wait?”</p><p>He acquiesced to her wishes, when all was said and done, although Tom was understandably keen on the idea of waiting until their wedding, being from a much different time period where marriage was quite a big deal, being very symbolic. </p><p>To Hermione, however, she felt that their vows were already essentially made when they became engaged. </p><p>“Marriage is only a sheet of paper, Tom. We are committed, that’s all that matters.”</p><p>Tom did not like that.</p><p>“If we are committed, then marrying should only be the natural next step,” he responded matter-of-factly. </p><p>He kissed her, then muttered against her lips, “I wish that we could perform the soul bond ceremony, but it will have to wait. I don’t yet have the items required for the spell.”</p><p>She toyed with his tie. “I wonder what it will be like.”</p><p>“To be bonded?”</p><p>“Mhmm.”</p><p>“I’m rather anxious to know myself “</p><p>She reached down and palmed his length over his trousers, eliciting a rumbling groan from his chest. He snatched up her wrist. “Don’t start something you do not intend to finish, darling.”</p><p>Hermione giggled and returned to packing beneath his dark stare.</p><p>The large majority of Tom’s possessions included books, a few choice articles of clothing, and a decent stash of magical artifacts which he’d nicked from Borgin &amp; Burkes when his employers weren’t paying attention.</p><p>“How did you steal <em> so many things </em>, Tom?” Hermione asked, exasperated.</p><p>He ran his tongue over his top teeth as she unearthed more rare objects from his various hiding places. “I suppose I got bored. I only stole a few things at first… then it became a sort of game to see how many things I could take without them noticing. Then… it became rather an addiction, as it was when I was a boy.” He shrugged. “Although, some of them weren’t exactly stolen. Sometimes when a customer came in to sell something rather rare that I decided I’d rather pocket, I’d offer them a much lower price than even Borgin would’ve. Most of the time, I could talk them into it.” He flashed her a grin and winked. “Then I kept them for myself, and they were none the wiser.”</p><p>She rolled her eyes. “The advantage of being Tom Marvolo Riddle.”</p><p>He threw his head back and laughed.</p><p>When they apparated back to Hermione’s flat, her  possessions were an entirely different situation, particularly her clothing.</p><p>Her flat had two extra bedrooms, which had been converted into closets. Madam Malkin’s and Twilfit and Tattings had loaded her down with an array of robes, cloaks, and dresses, as well as an assortment of boots and pumps. Hermione’s wardrobe was full to bursting!</p><p>Tom had never actually seen the two rooms where her clothes were stashed, and upon being shown the damage, he cocked a brow and looked at her dubiously. </p><p>“You’ll need an entire wing of Acheron Place just for your clothing.”</p><p>“Do you think we could manage that?” she asked, her eyes lighting up.</p><p>He shook his head and laughed, pulling her against him and placing a kiss on the crown of her head. “Whatever you desire, little witch.”</p><p> </p><p>——————-</p><p> </p><p>Later that evening, the night was moist and starless as they sat outside on a wicker sofa, admiring the freshly blooming garden on her balcony and gazing at the hypnotic flames as they danced in the firepit. Hermione’s legs were folded up beneath her, and Tom’s arm curled around her as she laid her head on his shoulder. </p><p>The bustling sounds of Horizont Alley were beginning to die down, leaving only the sound of the crackling fire and the lonely chirping of insects.</p><p>Hermione craned her head to peer up at Tom. The flames cast strange shadows on the angular planes of his face, his black eyes glinting like the luster of volcanic rock.</p><p>Sensing her regard, Tom tilted his face toward her. Their eyes met, communicating in the unique language of the soul, and Hermione secretly wished that his was whole and not split apart.</p><p>She wondered how different he would’ve been as a boy.</p><p>He held eye contact with her for several moments, causing her heart to stutter and then still, the intermingling of their magics intensifying until the very air around them seemed to snap and sizzle.</p><p>The look in his eyes melted her into a puddle of passion, and she radiated warmth from every cell in her body.</p><p>“Tom,” she murmured softly. </p><p>“Hermione,” he whispered, eyes still locked with hers.</p><p>She swallowed, and although she was terrified at what was about to transpire, she suddenly felt a peace descending, as if this were finally the right time. As they gazed at one another, she realized they both knew it.</p><p>“I’m scared.”</p><p>He shook his head slowly, exuding self-possession and calm as he whispered, “Don’t be.”</p><p>His hand rose to cup her chin, his thumb stroking her cheek gently.</p><p>“What if you hate me after?”</p><p>“No,” he said with a half-smile. “What happens in your memories may be your past, but it’s no longer my future. You’ve permanently altered the world, Hermione… and in the process, you’ve permanently altered me. I could never hate you.” </p><p>He leaned in as if to kiss her, but paused just before their lips touched. “I worship you,” he whispered.</p><p>Then he kissed her. </p><p>Hermione let out a soft sigh as his tongue entered her mouth, his invasion smooth and sensual as his hand slid to the back of her head. Her magic reacted to his, twisting and intertwining in a powerful swapping of energy. </p><p>Oh, how she loved magic: the study of it, the channeling of it… she loved the way it felt coursing through her body and humming in her fingertips.</p><p>Tom was the same, which was unsurprising. They were soulmates, after all.</p><p>They were simply two beings in love with the other’s magic, both dark and light strongly attracting through time and space.</p><p>Hermione moaned against his lips, his scent powerfully intoxicating as he surrounded her, his smell in her nostrils, his tongue in her mouth, his magic overshadowing her as if he could touch her everywhere all at once.</p><p>He kissed her so ravenously that she was dizzy when he finally pulled away, teeth tugging at her bottom lip.</p><p>He gazed down at her, running his thumb along her bottom lip.</p><p>“I love you,” he said softly. Hermione could feel his shadowy tendrils brushing up against her mental walls.</p><p>“I love you,” she whispered.</p><p>He gripped her chin and lifted her eyes to his. “Legilimens.”</p><p>Hermione dropped her mental walls.</p><p>Tom snaked through the maze of her thoughts, diving toward the year that was filed away just for his exploration: what would have been her seventh year at Hogwarts, but was spent on the run because of him.</p><p>They went along together as he observed Bill and Fleur’s wedding. He mentally scoffed as she danced with Viktor Krum at the wedding, but his interest piqued at the items bequeathed to them by Dumbledore. He watched the attack on the Burrow by Death Eaters and the announcement that the Ministry had fallen, which sent the three into hiding at Grimmauld Place. </p><p>He watched her memories as they flew by like a film reel, their attempts to solve the mystery of R.A.B., the hunt for the locket, and then, their ballsy infiltration of the Ministry to steal the locket from Umbridge.</p><p>Tom’s shock was palpable, but he didn’t pause or say anything; he merely continued on.</p><p>He observed the trio in the Forest of Dean, and seemed very interested in their passing of the locket horcrux between them.</p><p>Hermione’s thoughts were exposed to him, every weighted thought and hopeless feeling, then the darker turn that her thoughts took as the locket worked its potency on her heart. </p><p>Ron folded first, being the weaker-minded of the three. Tom watched his departure with detached silence.</p><p>Morale was scarce, and the burden of the locket grew heavier each day. Tom watched as Hermione grew pale and thin, with dark circles beneath her eyes, the cold of winter biting through to her soul and the horcrux systematically eating away at them both. Ron’s absence was a canker, a black hole that drowned any joy before it could germinate.</p><p>He saw the night that Harry and Hermione danced together, alone in their tent, and recognized it as the memory he’d seen during his invasion of her mind at Riddle House… he recognized the song as the same one that was playing on the music box the night Hermione had overdosed.</p><p>Puzzle pieces clicked into place, all of Hermione’s confusing and strange behavior over the past year and a half slowly began to make sense, and not only that, but it became almost horrifying.</p><p>Tom was not surprised by his actions. The strategic choices made by Lord Voldemort were those which Tom had been planning since his later years at Hogwarts. The horcruxes and their hiding places were so precise, his systematic dismantling of the Ministry and the entire regime was as he had always imagined it. </p><p>But to see it through Hermione’s eyes was revolting.</p><p>Of course, some of his actions in the future were much more gruesome than he would’ve imagined. Perhaps Hermione was right, and the horcruxes did in fact, destroy him.</p><p>He wouldn’t have charged a mere boy like Draco Malfoy with the murder of a wizard such as Albus Dumbledore. Tom was surprised to discover that he had given that order. </p><p>Tom would’ve wanted to kill Dumbledore himself. </p><p>He thought to himself that he wouldn’t have allowed his followers to act so ruthlessly. Of course, Tom wasn’t at all opposed to cruel behavior and brutality, but he preferred a more diplomatic approach where at all possible.</p><p>Mrs. Cole would always remind him when he would get in trouble for acts of savagery at the orphanage, that he could “catch more flies with honey.”</p><p>Tom hated the woman, but the adage lingered.</p><p>He supposed fourteen years roaming the earth as a soul incorporeal had wrought in him a great deal of pent up aggression and vindictiveness.</p><p>However, Tom felt a bit nauseated when he stumbled upon memories of Greyback and his sordid tastes. </p><p>He pricked back up when he browsed through Hermione’s thoughts of Grindelwald, Dumbledore, and her determination to unravel the mystery of the Tales of Beedle the Bard. A sort of pride rose up in Tom at Hermione’s steel and determination, despite the odds against her. </p><p>He was secretly rooting for his clever witch, despite the fact that it was, in fact, himself that he was rooting against.</p><p>The film-like memories flashed by one by one, subsequently shifting into their encounter in Godric’s Hollow. Tom’s skin began to crawl as soon as he witnessed the woman, Miss Bagshot, and he instantly knew something was wrong.</p><p>His heart fell into his stomach as his snake attacked them. </p><p>Tom wasn’t afraid of snakes; snakes loved him. Thus, he wasn’t surprised to know that he’d taken one as his familiar and made her into a horcrux. </p><p>More than anything, Tom was experiencing an intense level of anxiety and hopelessness as he vicariously experienced Hermione’s each and every feeling as if it were his own.</p><p>To walk through her own experience changed things. Her pain sliced Tom open.</p><p>As much as Tom wanted to see his own magic in action, so much more pronounced and full, his very own ideas already set into motion and coming to fruition… it was the pervading sense of fear and hopelessness in all of her memories that fractured him. </p><p>He watched as Harry was nearly killed by his locket while retrieving the sword of Gryffindor from the pond. Ron returned, and Tom thought them all strange occurrences indeed.</p><p>Her memories flitted by one by one and Tom consumed them all: their capture at the home of Xenophilius Lovegood, their discovery of the Deathly Hallows, the elder wand, and their theorizing about Dumbledore and Grindelwald. </p><p>They were kidnapped and brought to Malfoy Manor, and all the while Draco was attempting to identify Harry, Tom couldn’t help but feel a sense of foreboding. </p><p>Soon, he realized why. Bellatrix entered, and he recognized the witch who had carved Hermione up like a Christmas ham. Tom couldn’t even be proud of Hermione for her quick work with the stinging jinx. </p><p>He was too fixated on Bellatrix.</p><p>Hatred curled around his insides as he watched her interrogating the trio, spouting nonsense about the sword and her vault. </p><p>Lucius almost summoned Voldemort, and Tom wished that he had.</p><p>Would he have recognized Hermione? Would he have seen in her what he saw in her now?</p><p>He wanted to believe that he would’ve known his own soulmate, as he did now, but some part of him doubted it was possible. </p><p>The Voldemort of the future was not the same person. How could he have recognized his soulmate when he had so little of his soul left?</p><p>The witch was crazed as she ordered the prisoners into the cellar, but asked to keep Hermione.</p><p>Tom’s stomach turned, knowing what was next.</p><p>Ron offered himself, but Bellatrix responded that she would only fetch Ron if Hermione died during questioning. Tom’s heart thundered in his chest, his mouth going dry as the desert.</p><p>Tom swallowed as Ron’s desperate shouts rang out through the Manor, and Tom recognized the distraught emotion.</p><p>He was feeling much the same, despite knowing it was in the past and his witch was very much alive and breathing next to him.</p><p>It gave him a bit more grudging respect for the weasel boy.</p><p>Tom honed in on Hermione, whom Bellatrix began to interrogate. He saw through Hermione’s eyes as the witch asked her questions, which Hermione answered as truthfully as possible, tears in her eyes knowing that Bellatrix didn’t believe her. </p><p>Paralyzing fear racked Hermione as Bellatrix screamed at her in a crazed fury, and then the first Crucio was cast.</p><p>Tom felt it all, the racking pain and blinding agony.</p><p>He watched his witch twist and writhe on the floor, sobs and screams wrung from her body, eyes rolling back in her skull.</p><p>Again and again, the witch tortured her. Hermione’s vision began to blacken as she nearly lost consciousness.</p><p>Tom grew light-headed as he watched Bellatrix draw her blade.</p><p>She pinned Hermione to the ground and his witch’s scream was blood-curdling as the knife dragged through her flesh, blood immediately seeping up from each deep gash.</p><p>Tom broke eye contact and pulled out of Hermione’s mind sharply. </p><p> </p><p>—————</p><p> </p><p>Hermione was stunned as she watched Tom jump up and depart through the French doors of her flat in quick strides. </p><p>She sat in shock for a moment, partly from reliving that heinous memory, and partly not comprehending Tom’s reaction.</p><p>After a moment, she stood and ran into her flat after him.</p><p>She made her way down the hallway and found the bedroom door open, so she entered.</p><p>“Tom?”</p><p>The room appeared empty, but the door to the loo was cracked, so she pushed it open and found Tom on his knees, retching violently.</p><p>His face was even paler than normal, pupils dilated, his hands shaking with severe tremors as they gripped the porcelain. </p><p>Her lips parted, her heart twisting in her chest.</p><p>He retched again.</p><p>He gasped for breath, dragging in heavy inhales as if he’d been drowning. </p><p>Hermione knelt down beside him, gently brushing his hair back with her fingers. </p><p>“Tom,” she murmured. “Are you alright?”</p><p>He gave a curt nod. </p><p>She rubbed his back, and she could feel his heart thundering, vibrating through his entire body.</p><p>At length, he stood and straightened his tie, rolling his neck.</p><p>“We can stop-”</p><p>“No,” he interjected. “We will finish tonight.”</p><p>Hermione blinked, then swallowed, giving a quick nod. “If that’s what you want.”</p><p>He stared at the floor. “Give me a moment. I’ll meet you out there.”</p><p>She did as he asked, departing the bedroom and closing the door behind her.</p><p> </p><p>——————</p><p> </p><p>“Dobby,” Tom said, blinking in shock. </p><p>Hermione nodded, wiping at the tears that spilled over. “That has always been the one that I can never get over.”</p><p>“Remind me to thank that elf.”</p><p>Hermione gave him a watery smile. “You could always free him. Wouldn’t that be a full circle moment?”</p><p>Tom gazed at her intently. “Aberforth… Dumbledore’s brother?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>He nodded, lost in thought.</p><p>“Perhaps you’ll meet him. You will be part of the family soon.”</p><p>“I met him… at the Hog’s Head years ago. I just never put it together.”</p><p>He took a deep breath, then exhaled. He crossed one ankle over his knee and pulled his cigarette case from his pocket. He lit one wandlessly as he leaned back on the sofa in her sitting room. “So you did rob Gringotts after all.”</p><p>She grinned. “You said it was impossible.”</p><p>He smirked and cocked a brow. “I also said goblins are completely mad creatures, and I was not wrong. No wonder you went after them.”</p><p>She rolled her eyes. “They deserved it. They are <em> not </em> to be trusted.”</p><p>He flicked the ash away. “No doubt.” He took a deep drag, then expelled the smoke as he continued, “You did ride a dragon after all, didn’t you? Then you got my cup and my Tempaestus from the Lestrange vault.” </p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>He gazed at her from beneath dark brows, a wicked smile playing on his lips. “It was calling to you.”</p><p>She felt breathless. “I suppose.”</p><p>“<em> I </em> was calling you.” He winked, a devastating grin curving his lips. “Will you show me the memory of when you used it?”</p><p>She nodded. “Yes. But first, the Battle.”</p><p>“Ah, yes. My demise.”</p><p>She rubbed her lips together to keep from smiling. “It would be mildly funny if so many people hadn’t died.”</p><p>He sobered. “Come here, witch.”</p><p>She scooted closer and he wrapped his hand around her throat, pulling her close. “Legilimens.”</p><p>He shot into her mind. </p><p>She showed him everything: Voldemort’s attack upon Hogwarts, how they entered the school through the Hog’s Head Inn, how they rallied their forces, and then, Harry’s conversation with Helena Ravenclaw’s ghost, and the destruction of the diadem. She showed him the battle between his army of Death Eaters, his dark creatures, and Dumbledore’s army, and he watched as she and Ron descended into the Chamber of Secrets to destroy the cup. </p><p>Hermione could sense his shock when they spoke parseltongue, commanding the chamber to open. His surprise was tangible as he watched Hermione and Ron enter the chamber he’d spent so much of his time in as a teenager, there to destroy a piece of his soul with the fang of his basilisk. </p><p>Then, he witnessed their kiss, and she could feel his jealousy, hot and blazing like a furnace, painting the memory in red.</p><p>He watched as they numbered their dead, weeping over the bodies of their comrades.</p><p>Hermione, Ron, and Harry slipped out into the night, and witnessed the murder of Severus Snape by Voldemort.</p><p>More and more, Tom was beginning to realize why Hermione had feared him so.</p><p>He had grown into a dark creature, completely consumed by dark magic, soulless and mad, driven to insanity by his lust for power.</p><p>There was no boundary which Lord Voldemort wouldn’t cross, nor anything or anyone he held sacred.</p><p>Tom tried to reconcile that entity with himself.</p><p>He had so desperately wanted to know the truth, but he was beginning to realize that the monster in her memories would haunt him forever.</p><p>His serpent ripped Severus to shreds, and Voldemort left him coldly to die.</p><p>He watched as Harry collected his tears in a vial. </p><p>He felt Hermione’s terror as the voice of Lord Voldemort, high-pitched and rasping, bearing very little of his current tenor, called for Harry to meet him in the forest.</p><p>Then he pulled out of her mind.</p><p>Tom’s skin crawled.</p><p>“Tell me what happens.”</p><p>“You don’t want to see?”</p><p>He swallowed, his thumb gently stroking her hand. “No.”</p><p>“You killed Harry.”</p><p>His eyes flew to hers. “He was a horcrux, wasn’t he?”</p><p>Her eyebrows lifted. “How did you know?”</p><p>His jaw muscles tensed. “Seeing everything from your perspectives, it’s quite obvious.”</p><p>“Dumbledore knew.” She reached for his hand and touched his index finger. “Your ring… the Gaunt ring which you’ve made into a horcrux. It contains the resurrection stone.”</p><p>His eyebrows furrowed. “One of the hallows?”</p><p>She nodded. “Harry took it with him, so that he could be with his family when he died.”</p><p>Tom swallowed. “What happened after?”</p><p>“Draco’s mother lied to you. She said Harry was dead, but he wasn’t. He went to a sort of… afterlife, some kind of transition place. He saw Dumbledore there.” She gave him a gentle smile.</p><p>He blinked. “Keep going.”</p><p>Her lips parted, and she found it difficult to continue. “Your soul was there… the piece that had been attached to Harry. But it was mangled and near death. Harry and Dumbledore pitied you.”</p><p>Tom was silent for several moments. Then he cocked his head. “What kind of transition place?”</p><p>Hermione tilted her head and shrugged. “Harry described it as… sort of like King’s Cross Station, but not.”</p><p>Tom blinked several times. “I know that place.”</p><p>Her eyebrows rose. “You do?”</p><p>“I saw it when the dementor’s were performing the kiss.”</p><p>A look of fear came into her eyes. “You were nearly dead, then.”</p><p>He flicked his eyes to her. “The resurrection stone… you can see… the dead?”</p><p>She nodded. “You can see them, but they can’t come back.”</p><p>He bit the inside of his cheek. “I could see my mother.”</p><p>Her eyes roved his face. She lifted her hand and touched his cheek. “Yes, I’m sure that you could. Although I don’t know how the horcrux would affect it. It was no longer a horcrux when Harry used it.”</p><p>He nodded slowly. “What else happened?”</p><p>“Harry came back, but for all appearances, he was dead. We thought all was lost… you mocked us all.”</p><p>“Did we meet? You and I?”</p><p>She shook her head. “Not really. You were there. I was there. But we didn’t really… interact.” She sighed. “And then you were gone. The sword of Gryffindor came to Neville through the sorting hat, and he killed your snake. Then you dueled Harry, and Harry defeated you. The elder wand was submitted to Harry the entire time, and you didn’t know.”</p><p>He rubbed his chin thoughtfully. “That wand has got to be cursed.”</p><p>“You think so?”</p><p>He nodded. “Every owner is eventually murdered.”</p><p>Hermione exhaled, shaking her head incredulously. “You’re probably right, Tom.”</p><p>“That must be the wand they call the death stick.”</p><p>“An appropriate name, then,” she breathed. “Harry destroyed the wand. He snapped it, and threw it into the canyon.”</p><p>He nodded, his eyes narrowed in thought. “Hermione… the one who owns all three is known as the Master of Death? Is that right?”</p><p>She nodded. “According to legend.”</p><p>He turned to look at her. “Then we are the Masters of Death… you and I, and Dumbledore.”</p><p>Her lips parted as she met his gaze. “<em> Oh… </em> I suppose you’re right.”</p><p>“That cloak you wore at Riddle House, that is the cloak of invisibility, is it not?”</p><p>She nodded. “I never did get it back to Harry.”</p><p>He took a deep breath. “This is a lot to process, Hermione. It may take me some time… don’t be alarmed if I’m in my head more.”</p><p>”I understand.”</p><p>Their eyes met, his smoldering as silence fell between them. </p><p>There was no sound but the ticking of the magical clock on the mantle. It was one in the morning.</p><p>Neither of them dared to speak, to break the atmosphere. </p><p>A smile spread slowly across her face, and Hermione turned to crawl across the sofa toward him. His eyes narrowed.</p><p>She leaned forward and kissed him softly, not in a lust-filled hunger, but a slow, languid tasting of his mouth. She let her lips gently brush his, feeling the shape of his lips against hers, the warmth of his tongue, feeling the delicious beating of his heart beneath her palm. </p><p>She hummed happily under her breath and he shifted, the sound of their clothes rustling as he slid his arms around her waist, pressing her tight against him with his hand flat against her back. </p><p>His other hand gripped her arse. She could hear his sharp intake of breath in the silence, feel his growing hardness against her thigh. </p><p>He pressed her against himself, grinding her hard against his bulge. He broke the kiss just long enough to mutter, “You’re fucking phenomenal, witch.”</p><p>“Am I?” she asked breathlessly.</p><p>He nodded, his black eyes glinting like faceted flint. “I am infinitely impressed.” He kissed her. “…and intrigued.” Another kiss. “…and aroused.”</p><p>“Does that mean you see me as your equal?”</p><p>He nodded. “Most assuredly.”</p><p>She bit her lip. “I don’t really see myself as your equal, to be honest.”</p><p>He leaned forward and kissed her cheek. “You are, though. You will realize it in time.” He smoothed her frizzy curls, then brushed her lips with his thumb. “I can hardly believe you’ll be my wife.”</p><p>Her whiskey brown eyes were trained on him, lashes fluttering as he said words that pierced her heart. “Some part of me was wondering if you might change your mind after learning everything.”</p><p>The corner of his lip turned up in a half-smirk. “If anything, it’s rather solidified my belief that we are meant to be together. You’re a powerful witch, Hermione, and clever. I can make up for the holes in your education. All that matters is that you have so much potential. You could be greater than Dumbledore.” He ran his knuckles along her cheek, then ghosted his fingers along her collarbone, her shoulder and down her arm. He took her wrist in his hand and flipped her arm, casting a wandless revelio, baring her scar. His eyes found hers. “My Queen,” he whispered, pressing his lips to her scar, letting his tongue trace the contours of the letters. “A muggleborn… the Fates knew you were what I needed. So they gave you magic and sent you to me.”</p><p>His words were a validation that Hermione had desperately needed. Relief coursed through her, and she reached between them to unbuckle his belt. He leaned back, watching her with a dark gaze. </p><p>She bit her lip as she unzipped his trousers and withdrew his cock, long and thick and jutting out from his body, standing to attention beneath her gaze. She looked at him and found him staring at her with an expression of amusement. “Your throne, my Queen.”</p><p>She grinned devilishly and leaned forward to whisper in his ear, “Do you want to come, Tom?”</p><p>He instantly cocked a brow, thoroughly intrigued. “What if I do?”</p><p>She leaned forward and kissed him, then murmured, “You’ll have to give me your secrets first.”</p><p>He flashed his brilliant white teeth and threw his head back, laughing in a rich, deep tenor. “It seems you have me by the dick, little witch. What do you want to know?”</p><p>She ran her fingertips along his shaft and he shuddered, his cock jerking at the sensation. </p><p>“Bad things.”</p><p>His eyes narrowed, head cocked as he asked, “<em> What </em> bad things?”</p><p>“I want to know what you did in Albania.” She wrapped her hands around his cock and tugged, eliciting a groan from his chest. “I want to know how you broke into the Historical Society, and I want you to show me all the dark magic you’ve learned. I want to know how you got Hausler out of Azkaban.” </p><p>She sat back on her knees and slid off her top, then unclasped her bra and slid it off her shoulders, tossing it aside. </p><p>“Fuck,” he muttered as he drank in the sight of her naked from the waist up, his eyes tracing the full curves of her breasts and taut nipples. </p><p>“I want to know where you went for those four days… I want to see how you killed Minister Tuft… and I want you to show me how you broke it off with Walburga.”</p><p>He cocked a brow.</p><p>She shrugged. “I don’t like her… and I want to see you reject her.”</p><p>Tom grinned, his eyes flashing red for a moment. “Such a vindictive little witch… However, I will comply with all of your requests. Anything else?”</p><p>“I want to see your childhood.”</p><p>His grin dissolved, and he looked up at her pleading brown eyes. At length, he took a deep breath. “Alright. I agree.”</p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p>He inclined his head in welcome, then flicked his eyes to where her hand toyed with him.</p><p>“Now,” he breathed, indolently folding his arms behind his head. “I want the brightest witch of her age to suck my cock.”</p><p>

<p>
<span>Tom woke in a cold sweat. He jumped up immediately, swinging his long legs over the side of the bed and rushing to the loo. </span>
</p><p>
<span>He emptied his stomach, retching violently, his entire body racked with tremors.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For three weeks he had been like this. He’d been plagued by dreams of his future, of Hermione’s memories replaying over and over, of the snake-like monster he’d become…</span>
</p><p>
<span>… of the grave mistakes he’d made.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He dreamed of Hermione in pain, being grievously tortured. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As sure as Tom had always been of himself, as calm and confident a face he presented to the world… deep inside, behind his mask, he was a nervous, anxious individual.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He thought and overthought his every move to the point of insanity.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He had always been very sure of his plans until now. He’d even imagined them to be foolproof.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Now, he doubted himself, which was something Tom Riddle wasn’t used to.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Foolish. That’s what he had been in his arrogance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was plaguing him. Driving him mad. Each night he woke and spent the early hours of the morning deep in thought, his mind racing over the details of the future, everything he’d missed or overlooked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom lived in a constant state of self-editing, his perfectionism like an invasive plant whose vines often overtook everything in his life, wrapping themselves around him and choking the life out of him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But pride… pride was his worst vice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>His deadly sin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was a seed which germinated within him as it had Lucifer, and it alone caused him to make profound mistakes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He walked back into the bedroom, his eyes adjusted to the pervading darkness, allowing him to see that Hermione was still sleeping peacefully.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He stared at her for several moments, thinking about just how much his life had changed. How much she had sacrificed and overcome just to be with him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom was having difficulty processing the emotions he was feeling.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He’d never thought himself incapable of emotional intelligence before, but now he found himself fighting the depth of feeling the witch wrung out of him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He came to stand beside her, reaching a hand out to brush a strand of hair from her face. She stirred slightly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom swallowed back the thick bile that rose into his throat. The first light of dawn was beginning to peek through the windows, its rays virginal as they painted the room in a swathe of pink and pale gold.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He turned and left the room silently.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He made his way out to the french doors of the terrace, where Perdita was waiting with the morning paper. He took it and gave the bird her favorite treat, sugared violet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He retreated back into the flat and brewed his coffee, unease still simmering in the pit of his stomach. While he waited, he lit a cigarette and unfolded the copy of The Daily Prophet. His lips spread into a grin as he read the headline.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Wizengamot Verdict Finalized: Rosier Acquitted!</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>——————-</span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
<span>Tom held the old fountain pen in his open palm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It had been his father’s, and the leather box bore his own initials, etched in fine gold lettering.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Time was a strange thing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I took it after I killed him… just like I did the ring when I killed my uncle,” said Tom quietly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione watched his face, searching for a hint of Voldemort in his features, but she only detected a hatred born of neglect.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you still angry with him?” she asked softly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He scoffed. “I’d like to say I killed him in anger,” he muttered. “But I planned it.” He sucked in a drag from his cigarette, his cheeks hollowing before he exhaled, the smoke curling around him like an embrace. “His death was a better one than he deserved.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione watched him for a moment. “Did you… did you speak to him before…?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>His lips turned up in a smirk as he glanced at her. “Before I murdered him in cold blood? Yes, darling. I don’t care to repeat the things he said.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry, Tom.” She sat behind him, legs wrapped around his waist on her sofa, her cheek resting against his shoulder. She stroked his hair. “She did trick him, you know. He was understandably angry.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He blinked. “Was that my fault though?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, Tom, it wasn’t.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Silence stretched as they both stared at the instrument.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why did you make this object?” she asked. “What do you call it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He turned the pen over in his hand. “It’s ancient Egyptian magic. Known in more modern years as a </span>
<em>
<span>Tempaestus</span>
</em>
<span>. I had to rip open the fabric of time to make it. I thought the spell might kill me, as a matter of fact.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her eyes widened. “Can it… can it send someone back? Into the future?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He turned his head, and their eyes met. “Do you want to go back, Hermione?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her lips parted. “I…” </span>
</p><p>
<span>He watched her intently, his heart beating swiftly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>He’d considered the possibility that she might want to go back to her time, to her old life. His stomach turned at the possibility.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Fortunately for him, the object couldn’t send someone to the future.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hermione,” he began, setting the pen down on her velvet ottoman. “As far as I know, the object only works to pull someone through the tear when it was created. I performed the spell in nineteen forty-eight. If you used it again, it would only bring you back to last February.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She looked down, tinkering with his long fingers. “I understand.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom felt his hands going numb.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“If,” he continued, “you really wanted to go back. I could try to find a way.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She gazed at him for a moment, then shook her head. “No. It wouldn’t be the same as when I left. Everything has changed.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She gave a wry smile, then reached out and touched his cheek. “Besides… I wouldn’t be able to leave you behind.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>His eyes narrowed, his obsession richly saturating his coal black eyes. “If you think I’d let you leave without me, you're daft. You belong to me now, and if there’s one thing highly characteristic about me, it’s that I’m ferociously protective of my possessions.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione rolled her eyes with a huff. “I’m not one of your possessions.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>His lips quirked. “Oh, yes you are.” He turned around and took her chin between his thumb and forefinger, tilting her head back. “But I’m as much your possession as you are mine. Handle with care, little witch.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She rolled her eyes. “Wasn’t your basilisk also your possession? Will you drive a blade into my skull one day?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>His eyes roved her face and he smiled, then leaned down until their lips almost touched and he whispered, “The basilisk wasn’t my soulmate.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then he kissed her.</span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
<span>——————-</span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
<span>The time was nearing the end of July, with only two weeks until the election. Hermione sat on the sofa in front of Tom’s fireplace, working on a campaign speech. His flat had always been sparse, but now that it had all been packed up for the move to Acheron Place, Hermione found herself lost in thought, gazing around herself and reminiscing about her first night in his flat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Throughout the past few weeks, Tom had shown Hermione everything. She had been shocked by the ease with which he bequeathed the memories to her, particularly his memories of the orphanage. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Those in particular, made her feel a sharp pang of guilt. She had imagined his childhood to be full of hatred and anger, but she hadn’t been prepared for the bouts of loneliness and longing he’d endured. </span>
</p><p>
<span>All those years of war torn suffering, without the warmth of human affection, and with very few resources to go around, had caused his heart to ice over.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Hermione suspected, he fixated on his father, his rage festering like an infected wound over years of need and neglect. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When he discovered his father was indeed a muggle, one with ample wealth and resources, his anger boiled over.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The words of Abraxas Malfoy and Charles Macnair rang in his ears: </span>
<em>
<span>mudblood. Mudblood. Mudblood.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione witnessed it all.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was one thing Hermione hadn’t anticipated: Tom being bullied by his own followers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>How angry he must have been when they finally switched their allegiance, hailing him as the heir of Slytherin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom voiced his unwillingness to show her the murder of his father.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione acquiesced to his wishes. She didn’t particularly want to see </span>
<em>
<span>her</span>
</em>
<span> Tom in such an act of supreme violence. </span>
</p><p>
<span>He remarked that the memory was sacred to him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sacred?” she asked, aghast.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He nodded, his stoic beauty still catching her off-guard, those razor sharp cheekbones flexing with the remembrance of the act.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I believe it was a turning point in my life.” He looked back at her with cavernous eyes. “I’m glad that I killed him. I would do it again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione folded her arms against the chill in the flat as she recalled his words.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know,” she hedged. “There’s something I asked that you never answered.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>His eyebrow cocked as his eyes slid back and forth, devouring a chapter of the transcribed book of a Zulu sangoma named Vusamazulu Credo Mutwa. He’d learned about the African witch doctor through a chance meeting at Borgin and Burkes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And what might that be?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You never told me where you went those four days.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He blinked, then sat his book down in his lap and leaned back. “I unfortunately cannot tell you that yet. You’ll find that out on our wedding day.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her eyes widened. “Are you bloody serious?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He nodded, tongue running along his incisors as he gave her a wolfish grin, his legs spread and arms resting on the arms of the chair like a primeval god.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She felt distracted staring at him, suddenly experiencing the strong urge to see him naked, to see the strange markings that stretched across one side of his pale chest, to see his manhood standing to attention for her and only her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She’d become obsessed with Tom Riddle, every bit as much as Voldemort had ever been obsessed with his horcruxes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you trust me?” he asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her lips parted as she contemplated the question. </span>
</p><p>
<span>At length, she answered. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I do trust you… it’s myself I don’t trust.”</span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
<span>——————-</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione stood before a tall, arching door at the top of a stoop which belonged to a home in the wealthy district of Mayfair.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The cherry wood door was carved into an elaborate pattern reminiscent of the curves and twists of art nouveau.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It reminded Hermione vaguely of the doors to the hufflepuff common room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione swallowed, smoothing her a-line dress and adjusting the belt around her waist.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She wondered if she was making a mistake.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She took the mammoth brass knocker, which bore the molten image of a badger, and she used it to knock twice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A moment later, a little house elf with sallow skin and wide yellow eyes opened the door. With a squeaky voice, she ushered Hermione into the house, into an elaborate foyer with mahogany floors, marble pillars with palm trees at their bases, and a sweeping staircase which led the gaze upward. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione only had a moment to admire the vast height of the ceiling before a squat, heavy woman in bright fuscia robes emerged from one of the rooms. She held her hands out, her grotesque and over-painted face twisting into a smile beneath brilliant red hair which was piled atop her head. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Miss Dumbledore, how wonderful of you to pay me a visit! I’ve been following you in the papers all year! Mind you, I don’t pay a bit of attention to all the gossip. Last week they were sure you’d broken your </span>
<em>
<span>supposed</span>
</em>
<span> engagement. Some shifty source claimed they’d seen you on a little rendezvous with that muggle singer, Frank Sinatra! Imagine!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She chuckled and Hermione returned her smile hesitantly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you for entertaining me today, Miss Smith.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The old woman took Hermione’s hands, her gaudy jewels and baubles tinkling with her every movement. “Call me Hepzibah, my dear. Your father and I are old friends, even contemporaries! However, I must admit, I have no recollection of his ever being romantically involved with Eleanor, but then again, Albus was quite private. Always with his nose in a book in those days.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione smiled graciously, her heart beating a bit more swiftly. “I believe their relationship took place years after Hogwarts, Miss Smith.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The woman chuckled. “Well, so it did! And here you are! Blessing us all with your beauty and gumption! You must be some kind of witch to have snagged that Riddle. Such a handsome boy! Did you know we are friends? He often came to see me, you know. Oh, I’m sure it was on some pretext from Mr. Burke, but I do think he always enjoyed his time here. You should see the way his eyes light up when he sees the items in my collection! I could swear they almost turn red!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The woman’s eyes faltered somewhat, turning shifty and troubled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione’s breath left her lungs for a moment. So Tom had already been visiting the old woman, even though her death wouldn’t have been for another seven years. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom had been biding his time and waiting for the right object to present itself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Good thing he was under oath not to create any more horcruxes. Hepzibah’s was only one of the many lives that would be spared.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hepzibah sighed. “I haven’t seen him for many months now…” She eyed Hermione surreptitiously. “I imagine he’s been preoccupied with a certain someone.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione gave a tight smile. “Miss Smith, I’ve come in hopes that I might purchase a wedding gift for him. I’ve been told that your collection is unparalleled.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>At that, Hepzibah beamed, her greedy blue eyes lighting up. “I’d like to be modest, but the fact of the matter is, it’s true! No one in magical Britain has a more vast store of artifacts, and none of better quality and authenticity than mine!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione’s lips lifted into a grin. She leaned into the woman conspiratorially, as if they were old friends, and murmured in a near whisper, “Tom is very fond of Salazar Slytherin, being a slytherin himself. Have you any objects or artifacts connected to the wizard?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hepzibah lifted an eyebrow. “Well, I do happen to have some… but I’m loathe to part with them. They are </span>
<em>
<span>quite</span>
</em>
<span> valuable, and most of them I paid a small fortune for. You’d have to have something of </span>
<em>
<span>great</span>
</em>
<span> value to trade them for. Galleons don’t interest me, I’ve got more than enough of those already.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione smiled smugly and held out her hand. “Lead the way, Miss Smith. I think I’ve got </span>
<em>
<span>just</span>
</em>
<span> the item that might tempt you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>——————-</span>
</p><p>
<span>“- and that is why, with great sobriety, I bring to you an announcement regarding my campaign for the ministerial position.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The crowd waited with bated breath for Tom to continue. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The sea of faces was much larger than the audience of Tom’s previous speech, with his constituents growing daily in large numbers. Most were purebloods and half-bloods, with a smattering of vampires and werewolves, and a few muggleborns who believed Tom could change the methods with which they were introduced to magical society.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom scanned the crowd with narrowed eyes. He stood as a carved statue of alabaster, his skin seeming even paler today against his dark green robes, the angles of his face and hands appearing sharp as blades. </span>
</p><p>
<span>He spotted several of his death eaters in the crowd; their faces were guarded. He wondered what they would think of his forthcoming announcement. He supposed he could read their minds, but with a crowd this size, the onslaught of thoughts screaming at him would be like white noise.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom straightened his tie, his adam’s apple bobbing handsomely as he gave the crowd a somber look. “Citizens of Britain, I stand before you today to announce my withdrawal from the race of Minister for Magic.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There came a wave of gasps which issued from the crowd, followed by a series of whispers and murmurs. Tom lifted a hand to silence the cresting alarm of the audience.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It is with great regret that I withdraw my candidacy, but rest assured, I would not do so under any other circumstances. As you know, education has been one of the pillars of my platform. It has long been a dream of mine to teach at Hogwarts School, and this coming autumn, that dream will be realized. I’ve been offered the prestigious post of Defense Against the Dark Arts.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Again, gasps surfaced from the audience.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, hesitant applause rang out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom’s eyes flicked to Malfoy’s. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Abraxas’ gray eyes were cold as stone. Detached. Unreadable.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom’s eyes narrowed a fraction, his head tilting only slightly as he attempted to read Abraxas’ thoughts.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Where he’s always been able to penetrate his schoolmate’s mind, there was now a barrier.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was strong magic. A magic that Malfoy was capable of, but hadn’t tapped into yet, Tom was sure.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Irritation ticked in Tom’s muscles. Uneasiness unfurled in his gut.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Something was off. He’d felt it for weeks now. </span>
</p><p>
<span>He’d performed legilimency on his followers, and had seen nothing out of the ordinary… but Tom was intuitive.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Perhaps he even possessed a bit of </span>
<em>
<span>the sight</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom stared right back at Malfoy and grinned, slowly and wickedly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Malfoy shifted in his seat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve accepted the position, and thus, will be unable to perform my duties as Minister should I be elected. As you all know, there are three other candidates, one of which is a very public figure whom my name has been linked to very recently. I’m here to confirm publicly that Hermione Dumbledore is, in fact, my fiancè-“</span>
</p><p>
<span>Cheers erupted from the crowd.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“- and therefore, I know better than anyone how qualified she is for this office and how passionate she is about the matters which she will be tasked with addressing should she win the election. Hermione is brilliant and well-equipped to handle the position but not only that… she possesses the spirit which magical Britain needs to carry us all into the future. With that said, I fully endorse her candidacy and I encourage the electorate to cast their vote in her favor.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The audience sat in stunned silence for a moment before the sound of murmurs arose. Half of the crowd applauded him, and the other half sat agape, watching him leave.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Tom descended the platform, a barrage of questions awaited him from the press.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is your engagement a ploy or a power grab?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did Dumbledore offer you the teaching post so that his daughter would be sure to win the election?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Have either you or Miss Dumbledore changed your stances on muggle relations?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“When is the wedding?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How does Dumbledore feel about your engagement?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What do you have to say to your disappointed voters?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom shoved his way past the slew of reporters, thinking to himself that he would very much hate to be Minister for Magic, or any other such public figure that would have to entertain the press on a regular basis.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He much preferred to act as puppet master behind the scenes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom desperately wanted to drown them all in a sea of Fiendfyre.</span>
</p><p>
<span>——————-</span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
<span>“You don’t just</span>
<em>
<span> get out</span>
</em>
<span> of service to me, Rosier.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom lit a cigarette with a wave of his hand and took it between two of his fingers, expelling a cloud of smoke with no small amount of perturbation. He sat back in the wooden booth of the White Wyvern and tossed back a glass of firewhiskey.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rosier had been a week out of Azkaban, and he still looked gaunt and ghostly, despite his warm-toned skin. Tom had given him a few days to recover, then summoned him to Knockturn Alley using the dark mark.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rosier swallowed thickly. “I know that, my Lord. But… my father, somehow he knows it was your orders that got me chucked in Azkaban. He said I’m stupid and reckless, and… well, he doesn’t care much for you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom stared at the dark wood of the table as he flicked away the ash from the fag.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rosier,” he said slowly. “Your father is becoming a problem. You are aware of what I do with problems, I assume?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rosier’s lips parted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom breathed in smoke, then released it like a fire-breathing dragon. “I remove them.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rosier’s mouth snapped shut and he swallowed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom’s lips quirked, his onyx eyes meeting his death eater’s chocolate brown ones.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Would it not solve your problem with the pretty Haywood witch?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t want you to kill my father. I love my father.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom’s nostrils flared. “Then I suggest you sack up before I put him in the Rosier family crypt next to Edwin the first.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rosier’s mouth fell open, then he took a deep breath. “I just have to appear that I’m not in your ranks… for now. He… my father, that is, said that he will approve of my marriage to Winnie if I stay clear of you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom’s returning stare could have frozen over the Thames in July.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just until the wedding. Then there will be nothing he can do. My Gringotts vault will be released to me when I turn twenty-one. Just a few months. Legally he can’t do anything. I’m still in service to Lord Voldemort.” He swallowed. “I trust your leadership. There’s no one else I’d pledge allegiance to. Only… I’d like to not wind up in Azkaban again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom put out his cigarette, vanishing it with a wave of his hand. “You’d better move your galleons to Midas Bank. Gringotts stock is way down.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, I noticed… thanks to your fiancé.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom grinned, but said nothing. He merely let the smoke fall from his mouth like water, flowing down and over the table in their dark corner of the pub.</span>
</p><p>
<span>——————-</span>
</p><p>
<span>Aberforth grunted. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom shifted in his seat. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione bit her lip.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The only person who seemed untroubled was Dumbledore. He sipped his tea, then smacked his lips with a resounding, “Ahhh!” His blue eyes twinkled as he looked between them all.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Aberforth grunted again, his eyes flicking toward Tom. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom’s eyes couldn’t help roaming the Hogs Head. It had been years since he’d been here during school trips to Hogsmeade. In truth, he hadn’t come here much, because his compulsions couldn’t handle the filth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He stared at the strings of dust hanging from the old rusty chandelier, and the layers of dirt caked on what could have been a wood floor, but Tom could hardly tell at this point.</span>
</p><p>
<span>His skin crawled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He judged Aberforth harshly for it. Tom simply could not help it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He kept his thoughts to himself, guarding them carefully against Dumbledore’s powerful legilimency.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So, er…” Aberforth broke the silence. “Albus says you’ll be the Defense teacher next year.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom nodded stoically. “That is correct.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Content that he’d made some attempt at conversation, Aberforth settled back into silence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I saw that you pulled your candidacy, Tom.” Albus eyed him keenly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I did, sir. It was necessary.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione sipped her tea, her eyes flicking nervously back and forth between Tom and Albus.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The two wizards were sizing each other up subconsciously.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Aberforth surprised them all by piping in again with another loud grunt. “Do you ah… know when the wedding will be?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione’s eyes lit up. “It will be Christmas Day.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Aberforth lifted a dubious eyebrow. “Interesting choice.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was silent for several moments before Albus interjected, “Where will you live? Will you keep your flat while he is at Hogwarts, Hermione?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione’s eyebrows rose. “</span>
<em>
<span>Oh</span>
</em>
<span>, um… well, we have er… </span>
<em>
<span>acquired</span>
</em>
<span> a home. In Oxfordshire.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom’s lips twitched.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione prayed Albus didn’t inquire further into the means by which they acquired it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Marvelous!” Dumbledore chirped. “I shall expect an invitation once you’ve moved in well and proper.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Certainly, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dumbledore cleared his throat. “Well, it seems we are in for quite a bit of change this year. We’ve had a lovely few years with the shadow of Grindelwald not looming over us like a blasted plague. A wedding, and a new Minister for Magic is precisely what we all need, wouldn’t you agree, Tom?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“In spades, Headmaster.” He lifted his tea. “We can all thank you for defeating Grindelwald.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dumbledore’s eyebrows rode and he mirrored Tom, lifting his teacup. “Quite right. We certainly don’t need any more dark wizards. I pray the future is bereft of them.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Their eyes locked as they both took sips of their tea.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione’s eyes darted back and forth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Aberforth grunted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom smiled, inclining his head in agreement. He turned to Hermione. “Are you ready, my dear?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She gave him a questioning look. “Ready?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He nodded. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“For what?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>His eyes glittered like carbon gemstones. “To become supreme leader over all of magical Britain.”</span>

</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Tom Marvolo Riddle,” I say, as he walks into my office. “Simply rolls off the tongue.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “So does the killing curse,” he says with a charming smile as he sits himself. </em>
</p><p>
<em> I catch my breath; both at his daring remark and his statuesque beauty. </em>
</p><p>
<em> I ask him if he knows that from experience. </em>
</p><p>
<em> He assures me that he does not. </em>
</p><p>
<em> He’s tall, very tall. As imposing in stature as his fiancé had been in wit and grace when I met with her at the start of the year. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Mr. Riddle,” I say matter-of-factly. “There are many who have a great deal to say about you. I find it all quite conflicting. Perhaps you can help to paint a better picture of yourself for me.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “I’ll do my best.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> He’s a man of few words, his dark eyes snatching up everything, his ears consuming every word to be processed by the brilliant mind within his head. </em>
</p><p>
<em> That is the first thing that stood out as Witch Weekly prepped for this interview. Tom Marvolo Riddle is a purported genius, lauded by his Slytherin peers and professors alike. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Your schoolmates called you highly intelligent. Would you agree?” </em>
</p><p>
<em> He’s as still as a vampire, his demeanor only broken by the slight upturn of his lips. “That depends on the measuring stick, Miss Wimborne.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> He wears a modest but precisely-tailored black suit and a dashing pair of Malkin’s robes, which he says were gifted to him the moment his engagement to Hermione Dumbledore was leaked. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “So it is true then?” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “It is.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Hermione is quite the public figure,” I say, recalling my last encounter with the witch. “She’s been called the golden girl of the wizarding world. I had the pleasure of interviewing her some months ago.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> He inclines his head, the light casting deep shadows on his planes of his features. “It was a marvelous article. I commend you.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> Of course, I beam. How could I not? If I thought Hermione Dumbledore was charming, I was nowhere near prepared for her counterpart, who manages to be both magnetic and innocuous all at once. “I hope to do you the same justice, once we become better acquainted, Mr. Riddle.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> He pulls something out of his robes. It appears to be a case of muggle cigarettes, which is a kind of pipe not made of wood but paper instead. His nimble fingers pull one out of the case and lift it to his lips. “May I?” </em>
</p><p>
<em> How interesting, this wizard’s habits. He seems to be a walking contradiction. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Of course, be my guest,” I say, gesturing to the tiny item in his hands. “That actually leads me to my burning questions. Obviously, the public is dying to know more about your relationship with Miss Dumbledore and your career goals together. I’ve done a bit of research on you prior to this interview. It seems you’ve been running with the princes of the pureblood families for many years, even some have gone so far as to say that you’re a sort of leader for them, which I find surprising. Witches blush and sing your praises. A prefect and head boy; the highest marks in your year. All of your professors brag about your scholastic bent, applauding your keen manner of wielding magic. But the question I must ask first, is the question Britain is dying to have answered. With you and Miss Dumbledore being so at odds with one another, how did you come to find yourselves in a romantic relationship? The wizarding world labeled you both as enemies… what changed?” </em>
</p><p>
<em> He cocks his head, deliberating on his answer. “The wizarding world labeled us as enemies based on the things Hermione said and published about me. I never saw Hermione as an enemy.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> He leans back in his chair, languid as a panther as he breathes in a lung-full of smoke. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “What a revelation! But I must ask, given your political differences, how do the two of you manage to see eye to eye?” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “We meet in the middle, as any good politicians would.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> I must return to my notes momentarily, to avoid being sucked into a rabbit trail of questions with this fascinating individual. He sits watching me in cool self-possession as my eyes wander over my list of questions. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Let me hone in on that for a moment. Many publications of lesser repute are attempting to paint Hermione as a fraud. Even The Daily Prophet , which is Hermione’s former employer, has changed the tone of their articles regarding her. Despite your differing views, you’ve endorsed her campaign, even withdrawing your name from the ballot. What do you have to say about that?” </em>
</p><p>
<em> He blinks, his cavernous eyes fringed by dark lashes. I almost sense that he’s attempting to read my mind, but I feel no hint of legilimency.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Hermione Dumbledore is a powerful witch, Miss Wimborne. The wizarding world has yet to witness the kind of magic she is able to wield. She’s capable of changing the world as we know it. We have only seen a glimpse of that. Her career is just starting.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “As is yours,” I hint. </em>
</p><p>
<em> His eyes narrow slightly, his lips twitching with a repressed smile. He says nothing, only inclines his head. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Despite his harmless guise, there is something dangerous and yet, so alluring about this wizard. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Allow me to shift direction somewhat. Not much is known about your background, but there are whispers that you could be related to a renowned wizard, Salazar Slytherin. Can you confirm or deny this?” </em>
</p><p>
<em> Mr. Riddle shrugs. “It is a possibility.” He crosses his ankle over his knee. “All of my family on either side is deceased.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “It is true then, that you grew up in a muggle orphanage?” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “It is.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “How brutal your childhood must have been.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> He lights another cigarette in a beautiful display of wandless magic. “Then, perhaps you can understand why muggles are not my favorite creatures.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “They are human, yet you refer to them as creatures. Very interesting.” I watch him carefully, but his expression is guarded. “Still, your platform has partly been built upon aiding the transition of children with muggle parents.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> He gives a fraction of a nod. “I will admit that Hermione’s views have influenced me. You can also understand that while half of my blood is magical, for all intents and purposes, I was brought into the magical world in much the same way as a muggleborn.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> This pair is a confusing match for sure. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “I do wonder,” I hedge, “what your pureblood peers would say of your shifting views? You are often placed in the company of Abraxas Malfoy, who recently took over his father’s seat on the Wizengamot upon his passing in 1947. In the past two years, he has voted adamantly against any legislation supporting favorable muggle relations, effectively halting any progress toward the kind of world your fiancé hopes to create. It is even rumored that his father was a supporter of Grindelwald, during the early years of his rise. As a possible descendent of Salazar Slytherin, a wizard who despised muggles and muggleborns alike, and as someone who is placed in the company of many pureblood families, how will you reconcile these differences?” </em>
</p><p>
<em> He takes one last inhale from his cigarette, the end glowing like the coals of a fireplace as he hollows his cheeks. Then he breathes out smoke, vanishing his cigarette in one swift movement of his fingers.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Some things will be revealed in time, Miss Wimborne. Fate has played a hand in our union, and I’m sure that fate has more surprises yet in store.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> What a beautiful answer, an artful way of avoiding my question. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “What is your relationship with Dumbledore, Hermione’s father?” </em>
</p><p>
<em> Riddle cocks an eyebrow, the first sign of any reaction. “I am grateful he took a chance on me.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Do you think it had anything to do with your relationship with his daughter?” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Possibly.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> That is all he will say on the topic. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Charles MacNair, a wizard I’m told is a friend of yours, was quoted saying this when asked about Miss Dumbledore, ‘She’s a bright witch, but much too confident in her opinions. Where she sees progress and potential, I see danger. Her goal is peace with muggles, but it should be protection for our kind instead.’” </em>
</p><p>
<em> Tom Riddle is very still, and he blinks, but there seems to be a slight tick of his head to the left. </em>
</p><p>
<em> His aura seems to darken with any negative words spoken about his fiancé. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “He is entitled to his opinion,” he says coldly. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “You do not agree with him?” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Of course not. I do believe muggles pose a threat, but that is not to say that some form of peace cannot be achievable.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “I sense that this could potentially cause a rift among your friends.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> Riddle says nothing. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Evoking a reaction from him is like squeezing water from a stone. </em>
</p><p>
<em> I choose to change topics. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “It seems that based on your decisions since graduating from Hogwarts, you’ve attempted to remain out of the spotlight. Your relationship with Hermione and your choice to run for Minister has brought you forward into the public eye significantly. Is that strategic?” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Are you asking if my relationship with Hermione is strategic?” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Well, no, of course not.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Of course you are. But I’m sure you’re only mirroring the musings of the public, which is in fact your job, so I take no offense. If it were my choice, I would have remained as private as possible for as long as possible. But fate, it seems, has other plans for me.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Hermione has said similar words before,” I smile. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Did I answer your question?” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “You did,” I concede. “But I have another.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> His jaw muscle tenses, a sign that our interview is potentially at an end. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Tom Riddle is your given name, but another name is attached to your person, although it is whispered in hushed tones in secret, behind closed doors. There is a sentiment of fear behind it. I must ask… Who are you? Are you Tom Riddle, or are you Lord Voldemort?” </em>
</p><p>
<em> His eyes narrow for a brief moment, then his face clears. </em>
</p><p>
<em> His dark eyes are strange, almost seeming to be the color of Merlot. <br/></em>
</p><p>
<em> His handsome mouth turns up in a mysterious smile. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “I Am Lord Voldemort.” </em>

<p>
<span>Gaspard sighed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He stood in Dumbledore’s office, gazing out over the quidditch pitch through diamond-paned windows. </span>
</p><p>
<span>His eyes wandered farther out, to the Black Lake, whose rippling, murky waters mirrored the turbulent state of his emotions.</span>
</p><p>
<span>His blue eyes looked away, and he turned to face Dumbledore.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll admit… he’s bested me.” His jaw tensed. “Hausler has completely disappeared. Dolohov is nowhere to be found… and there’s not a single bit of evidence that points any of it to him. I’ll be perfectly honest…” He sighed, rubbing his eyes in frustration. “I’m at my wits end. Between running my department and these temporary ministerial duties, and the slew of active investigations that continue to crop up… I’m losing my mind, Albus.” He shook his head. “What the devil is Hermione thinking?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dumbledore sat back in his chair, running his hand down his beard thoughtfully. “You’re sure it was him?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dufresne nodded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You say that Hermione was at the prison?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“My aurors saw her. She didn’t deny it, Albus.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dumbledore heaved a deep breath. “Be that as it may… he does appear to be making an effort… but then again, he’s always been a sneaky sort. Never did trust him.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dufresne was quiet for a moment. “Did you read the article?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I assume you mean the one in which he revealed himself as Lord Voldemort.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The very one.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dumbledore’s chest rumbled as he sipped his brandy. After a moment, he muttered, “I did read it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Gaspard exhaled sharply. “Given the events of the past few months, and Britain’s fear of this dark wizard gang… I would’ve anticipated more outrage by his admission. But once again, the population as a whole surprises me. With Riddle now being tied to the Dumbledore name, particularly to Hermione, and with his recent appointment as DADA professor, it’s as if the whole country has blinders on. He seemingly can do no wrong. I can’t wrap my head around it. Where’s the outrage?” He shook his head, his brow furrowed in vexation. His movements were short and jerky as he poured himself a glass of firewhiskey. He tossed the glass back, downing it in one gulp. As he poured another glass, he turned his eyes on Dumbledore. “Why did you give him the position?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Their eyes met, a crashing of brilliant blue seas. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Dumbledore took a sip of brandy, then replied, “He had asked me for my permission to propose to Hermione. When he brought up the position, I knew it would be the easiest way to keep an eye on him. Otherwise, I would have no way of ensuring Hermione’s safety, no way of determining if he is truly good for her. I have very little trust for him, and even less of late, with these recent developments. There are things I know about him that disturb me continuously. This way, I can keep an eye on him.” He sighed. “I had hoped you two might take up together. A foolish hope, perhaps, but it would’ve been in her best interest.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dumbledore’s eyes cut to Dufresne.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The latter stood gazing out at the quidditch pitch once more, his crystalline eyes taking on a ghostly pallor under the refracting light. His cheek muscles flexed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“There might have been a moment,” he replied quietly, his rich timbre sounding a bit strained. “But it was very fleeting.” He finished off the last bit of firewhiskey in his glass, then sat it on the stone windowsill. “Riddle has her under a spell. There was nothing I could do.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How demoralizing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Silence ensued, accompanied by the music of magical instruments spinning on their pedestals.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dumbledore cleared his throat. “He claims that they are soulmates.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dufresne ejected a stream of air from his nostrils, the barest hint of caustic laughter. “Of course he does.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“For her sake, I hope it’s true.” Dumbledore sighed. “Otherwise… what a tragedy it could be.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dufresne’s head snapped up. “It’s highly unlikely, given that the soulmate theory has never been properly tested…, But I’d say that if it is true, what does that say about Hermione?” He looked away coldly, his throat bobbing as he swallowed his bitterness.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The older wizard stroked his beard. “She needs you and I, Dufresne. She is a clever and cunning witch, capable of great things, however… her emotions get the best of her at times. Her heart is soft, despite everything she has endured. She will need our help, not only in dealing with Riddle, but with her new appointment as Minister for Magic. That is a heavy burden, as you well know. She is quite young to take on such responsibility.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dufresne’s eyes fell closed, and he slowly nodded in agreement.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dumbledore eyed him with intensity. “You will both be working together </span>
<em>
<span>closely</span>
</em>
<span> in the years to come.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dufresne opened his eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A moment passed before his lips parted…</span>
</p><p>
<span>But no words issued forth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Will you be a friend to her, Gaspard?” asked Dumbledore quietly. “Will you look after her? Be the person that she needs?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dufresne blinked twice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then he cleared his throat. “Hermione will be married. She has other friends, Albus… friends that she hasn’t…” He paused, took a sip of firewhiskey, then continued, “Friends that she hasn’t kissed. That line has been crossed and I cannot uncross it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dumbledore tipped his head in acknowledgement. “Understandable.” He sighed as he eyed the younger wizard. “I’m starting to think that you care for her much more deeply than you’ve let on.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dufresne took a deep breath. “Even more reason to keep my distance.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dumbledore hummed softly as he poured his friend another much needed glass of firewhiskey.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>————————-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Tom Riddle finished, and he leaned back, admiring the body of the woman he’d just violently claimed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Their eyes met.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He took up his wand, not allowing the flicker of fear in her eyes to escape his attention.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He lowered it, dragging the tip along her clavicle, then down the valley between her breasts, over the dip of her bellybutton, and at last it came to rest at the peak of her womanhood.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He flicked the wand sharply, causing Hermione to twitch and bite her lip as he cast the contraception charm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then with another flick of his wand, he cast a charm that caused warmth to spread throughout her middle, and a pleasant numbing sensation took away the slight discomfort.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sometimes he was rough, too rough… but Hermione craved it in a way that alarmed her, in a way that made her question who she’d always thought she was.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He observed her as his hand found hers, his long fingers absentmindedly toying with the emerald ring on her finger.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He lifted her hand, and pressed his lips to the finger that bore it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She swallowed. “Did you mean what you said?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He knew what she was referring to. Somehow the bond between them had sharpened in a way that allowed him to intuit her thoughts and emotions.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I did.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione said nothing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>He could sense her rising unease, so he covered her naked body with his, the hard planes of his abs and chest and limbs like pale marble against hers, warming her chilled skin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hermione,” he murmured.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her amber eyes flicked up to meet his. </span>
</p><p>
<span>He stroked her inner thigh softly. “I am, and will always be, Lord Voldemort.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her lips parted, her breath escaping in halting degrees. “You know that name terrifies me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Still?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She nodded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The muscles in his defined jaw rippled. “Then allow me to change your perspective on the name. You are safe with me, Hermione. Perhaps the only person alive who is. You have nothing to fear from me. You should know that by now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She reached out and touched his cheek. “Perhaps my fear will subside with time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Silence ensued for several moments before he spoke. “You are not the only one with fears, Hermione.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She tilted her head. “What do you mean?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I fear you as well.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her brows knit sharply. “Why?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I fear what you’ll do. I fear that one day you’ll change your mind, decide that something’s wrong with me, that I’m too far gone… that I don’t measure up to your impossible moral standards.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She swallowed. “I wouldn’t be marrying you if I didn’t think we had a chance. But… At the same time, part of me does fear that you’ll destroy us. Well, not you, but… Lord Voldemort.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom toyed with the ring on her finger. “Hermione… I made a vow. No more horcruxes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She looked down at their hands. “I know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He watched her for a moment, then exhaled through his nose. “I am what I am, Hermione. You’ve known this. But I am capable of change. Have I not changed since we met?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“There are still things we don’t see eye to eye on.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What things?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She sighed. “Like muggles… and the unforgivables… </span>
<em>
<span>murder..</span>
</em>
<span>. Dark magic</span>
<em>
<span>.</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p>
<span>His Adam’s apple bobbed as he swallowed hard. “Are you going to try to change me, then? Mold me into someone better suited for you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione’s eyes met his and she took a deep breath. “No…” Her hand left his and wandered to his chest. She placed her palm flat against his skin, directly over his heart, which beat against her hand like any other man’s. Whenever fear gripped her, she let herself feel it beating against her skin… a reminder of his humanity, and of their souls which were inevitably linked. “But I can’t stop myself from wanting to save you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You have saved me, Hermione.” He placed his hand over hers, a smile playing on his lips. “You’re so noble. You’d save the whole world if you could. I, however, would burn the whole world just to save you.” He threaded his fingers with hers. “As long as I have you, the entire world can go to Hades for all that I care.” He ran his tongue over his top teeth. “You, on the other hand… I think you might sacrifice me to save the whole world.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She laughed softly. “Oh, I don’t know. I’ve become selfish when it comes to you. Perhaps you’ll slowly corrupt me. Perhaps I won’t recognize myself.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Would that be such a bad thing? You were nauseatingly principled when we first met. I like to see you throw out your ethics in order to get what you want.” He looked down at the ring on her finger and his lips curled into a grin. “The color green looks magnificent on you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione’s lips twitched, eyes narrowing as she gazed back at him. “I’m still a Gryffindor at heart, Tom.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He smiled and nodded. “A true Dumbledore.” He leaned in to kiss her hair and hissed something in her ear that she didn’t understand, because he was speaking parseltongue.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What did you say?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>His lips lifted into a lopsided grin. “You have a lion’s claws but a serpent’s venom.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>———————-</span>
</p><p>
<span>Later that morning, Tom sat at one of the only pieces of furniture left in Hermione’s flat, the little round breakfast table that looked out over the terrace. Hermione emerged dressed in a red, A-line dress that buttoned up and belted around her slim waist.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She had swiped the same ruby color over her lips, and Tom cocked an eyebrow as she entered the room, her pumps clacking on the wood floor. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you attempting to make a statement with that color?” he asked, lips twitching in amusement.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What if I am?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He stood and approached her, gazing down at her from his ample height. He reached up and ran his thumb lightly across her bottom lip. “I’d say it suits you marvelously, although I’d prefer the color smeared down your chin instead.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She tipped her head downward and took his thumb into her mouth, smearing the color over his skin as she slid her tongue beneath. Her stomach flipped when she heard his sharp intake of breath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She popped his thumb out of her mouth and fixed her lipstick, then slapped his cheek gently with the palm of her hand. “I have somewhere to be.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As she walked away, she smiled to herself, knowing he was adjusting himself as he watched her go.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>——————</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hermione sat at her desk at the factory, in her office at the Chronomancer. One window looked out over the Thames, and the other gave her a sparkling view of the gleaming gold facade of Midas Bank. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She was quiet, beleaguered with thoughts of Tom and his interview with Witch Weekly.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I am Lord Voldemort.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She often wondered if she was making a mistake, but there was absolutely no turning back for her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom was deeply carved into her heart.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She sighed, her mind clouded with questions and uncertainties, but she shook them away. The election was two nights away, and these final hours were critical for her campaign.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You sigh like the world is coming to an end,” Cedrella hedged. She had been appointed as Hermione’s campaign manager, and was currently tallying the most recent poll numbers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mind your own business,” Hermione said playfully.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Cedrella chuckled, miming Hermione’s facial expression. “Anyway… the poll numbers are looking optimistic. You’ve an almost ten percent lead on both Flint and Bletchley.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you think I’ll make a good Minister, Cedrella?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Cedrella didn’t hesitate. “The very best.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione nodded, rubbing her lips together.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Cedrella cocked her head. “It’s a lot of change all at once. Just take one change at a time. You don’t have to rush into marriage. Engagements can be any length of time… pace yourself.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione sighed. “Thank you, Ced. I think I’ll check on Winnie.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>——————</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Winnie all but had the factory up and running, with her potions lab organized to perfection and her stores displayed immaculately on their shelves.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Winnie was perfecting a potion which would counteract the jelly legs jinx when Hermione stopped by to check on her progress.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione had been there a total of ten minutes before Winifred exploded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hermione, he proposed!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The joy on her friend’s face was palpable, and Hermione gawked when she held out her hand. On her ring finger sat a dazzling marquis-cut sapphire, nearly the size of a robin’s egg. The white gold bezel was crusted with diamonds and twinkled as Hermione turned it over and over, examining it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, Winifred, that’s incredible. I am so, </span>
<em>
<span>so</span>
</em>
<span> happy for you. You deserve this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I just… I just can’t believe it,” the young witch murmured breathlessly. “Only months ago I’d lost him, and my family was in ruins. Now, I have the business I wanted… and the Wizard I love. Even my father’s health seems to be improving.” She looked at Hermione with adoration. “It feels like you’ve been a good luck charm. Ever since I met you, everything has changed for me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione shook her head. “No, Winnie. Don’t put me on a pedestal. You deserve this. This is the universe rewarding you. Don’t give me credit for something that you’ve drawn to yourself all on your own.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Winnie grinned, her pale green eyes glistening like ocean swells. “You’ll never convince me that you aren’t my good luck charm.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“When will you get married? And where? Have you thought about it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Winnie shook her head. “Well… no! I haven’t… I never even thought he would ask me. I’d lost hope completely. I mean…” Her eyes flicked to Hermione, who watched her curiously. “His father was against our marriage. But it seems he’s made some concessions.” She swallowed. “Part of me doesn’t want to join that family. I’m afraid of being controlled. They have a strong hold on Edward.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Then don’t let them,” Hermione said, taking her hands. “Edward chose you. He cares enough for you that he went against their wishes. He loves you for who you are… don’t let them change you.” Hermione lifted her hand, tucking a strand of Winifred’s pale, silky hair behind her ear. “Perhaps you’re his escape. Maybe he’s suffocating… and you’re his breath of fresh air.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Winnie bit her lip, then nodded. “Perhaps you’re right.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Enjoy it… being in love. There’s nothing like it under the sun.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Winnie’s lips slowly spread into an effervescent smile, and a girlish giggle escaped from her chest. “Perhaps we will double date… that is, if you’re not too busy being </span>
<em>
<span>Minister for Magic</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>——————-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The night of the election came, and Tom stood in Hermione’s flat, gazing into the floor length mirror as he straightened his bow tie.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Citizens of magical Britain had cast their votes, and a gala was being held at the Ministry to announce the winner.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In the reflection of the mirror, Tom could see Hermione getting dressed. His eyes flashed red as they traced her form, snatching up the sight of her bare back and the curves of her hips as she stepped into her gown.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He pinned in his cufflinks as she attempted to fasten the gown. After several moments, her frustration boiled over and she reached for her wand. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom chuckled and turned, walking over to her as he began to fasten the gown for her, his quick fingers brushing softly against her skin as he did so.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Tonight is your night, little witch.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s our night. I couldn’t have done this without you. Besides… we don’t know yet if I’ll win.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom snorted, a stream of air ejected from his nose. “You know I don’t leave anything to chance.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She took a deep breath, then turned. “Yes, but as we both know, even the best laid plans can be derailed.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>His cheek muscles tensed, but he nodded in concession. “Unfortunately, you’re right. But tonight, I am fairly certain you’re the winner here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione rubbed her lips together, shaking her hands out as if shaking out her nerves.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom’s eyes roamed her greedily. “No need to be nervous, darling. You were made for this. You’re right where you are supposed to be… the fates themselves are on your side… and so is Lord Voldemort.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione gazed up at him, marveling once again, as she often did, that she’d found herself here, with him, engaged to be married to the wizard who had once wrecked her life so heinously.</span>
</p><p>
<span>What an unforeseen twist of fate.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I love you,” he muttered softly, his arms slipping around her waist.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Kiss me,” she whispered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He covered her lips with his, then twisted on his heel, apparating them both with a soft click.</span>
</p><p>
<span>—————</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione and Tom appeared in the alleyway behind the Leaky Cauldron, where their election night security officer met them, wand in hand, ready to escort them directly into the ministry.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He ushered them into the back room of the Leaky Cauldron where they traveled by floo to the atrium of the Ministry of Magic.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione gasped when they arrived, gazing out over the celebration from the balcony of the third level.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A stage was set up on one side of the Ministry’s foyer, and on the stage stood Celestina Warbeck and her magical swing band. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her dreamy voice reverberated throughout the hall, punctuated by a smooth saxophone solo. Hermione admired the trumpet and trombone players, and the jazz pianist who sat on the far right of the stage, plunking away at the keys instinctively, playing in no less than three separate octaves with invisible hands.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Celestina winked at Hermione as she finished crooning her latest hit, “Confund Me, I’m Yours,” and transitioned into a well-loved classic, “Rennervate My Heart.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The ceiling glowed with a thousand tiny lights and three enormous banners were suspended from the ceiling, each bearing a moving photograph of a ministerial candidate. They reminded Hermione of the house banners that hung at the year-end feast at Hogwarts prior to announcing the winner of the House Cup. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The lobby of the Ministry was flooded with witches and wizards garbed in their finest robes, mixing and mingling and drinking elf-made champagne.</span>
</p><p>
<span>On the other side of the hall, stood a memorial for Minister Tuft, in honor of her memory.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione winced slightly as she laid eyes on it, then flicked her eyes up to Tom, who stood smirking down at her. He leaned in and whispered against her ear, “She shouldn’t have threatened my soulmate.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione took a deep breath and gave a wry smile. He squeezed her hip and guided her forward.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They stood on a balcony above the atrium, looking down upon the celebration below. On either side of them, were the respective balconies belonging to the other candidates, where they would enjoy the proceedings with their campaign teams and families until the announcement was made.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It wasn’t long before the party-goers caught sight of Tom and Hermione, and began to point and whisper.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was the first public appearance they had made as a couple, after all. There were bright flashes of cameras as she and Tom began to make their way down a wide staircase to the floor below. The train of Hermione’s crimson dress robes trailed behind her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hermione!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione turned back to find Winnie Haywood at the top of the stairs, grinning and waving to her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, Winifred! How marvelous to see you. It’s almost as if we didn’t see one another mere </span>
<em>
<span>hours</span>
</em>
<span> ago.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Winnie laughed and waved her up. “Come up here! I’ve got something to show you.” She gave Tom an apologetic look. “Can you spare her for a few moments? There’s plenty of mingling to do, I’ll have her back in a jiffy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hermione stood on her tiptoes and pecked Tom on the cheek. “I’ll only be a moment.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He squeezed her hip again as she turned and marched back up the stairs, her gown twisting behind her. He bent down to fix it, and then watched them disappear into the corridor. Then, he turned to make his way back down the stairs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom was met by Mulciber, who handed Tom a glass of firewhiskey, then lifted his own glass of gillywater. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Congratulations, my Lord, on your engagement,” he rumbled in his deep voice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom cocked his head, sensing something about the interaction which caused him to glance back at his death eater.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mulciber held his glass aloft, his eyes unreadable. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom hesitated, then allowed himself to lift his own glass, the clinking sound reverberating through his consciousness as he tuned in, allowing his magic to comb his follower’s mind, his motives, sending out feelers in search of something. </span>
</p><p>
<span>What was he searching for?</span>
</p><p>
<span>He found nothing, and now was not the time for a round of legilimency.</span>
</p><p>
<span>His eyes narrowed. “Thank you, my friend.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mulciber inclined his head, but said nothing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There were little fairies that had been trained to aid in carrying memos for ministry workers, only tonight they were taking up empty cups and champagne flutes for refilling. A little blue fairy took Tom’s glass, barely able to keep itself in the air as the weight of the crystal dragged him down, and with much effort, carried it away. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom watched it beat its wings vigorously, and after a moment, he whipped out his wand, gave it a quick swish and suddenly the fairy seemed buoyant again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He pressed his tongue against his cheek and twirled his wand between his fingers before tucking it back into the inner pocket of his jacket. </span>
</p><p>
<span>He turned back to Mulciber to find his death eater eyeing him with an arched brow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom gave him a nod and clapped him on the back, then  proceeded to walk away, making his way through the crowd as he attempted to stem the needling sense of foreboding pricking his consciousness.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He made the rounds, greeting Yaxley, Runcorn, the Greengrasses, and Rookwood. He ran into Slughorn and had a quick laugh with him before catching the eye of Alphard Black. Tom tossed him a devious grin, to which Alphard looked away angrily.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom would’ve felt triumphant about that, if he hadn’t begun to search the room for Hermione, thinking that she should have returned by now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As he scanned the room, searching for his fiancé, he ran into Rosier, who appeared with a moonlit witch on his arm, Miss Haywood, sporting a brand new sapphire ring on her finger.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Congratulations, by the way,” he murmured as he glanced around distractedly. “Is that what you were showing Hermione?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I beg your pardon?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom dragged his eyes back to the witch, and found the pair staring at him with brows furrowed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom cocked a brow. “At the top of the stairs… you said you had something to show her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The pale blonde witch tilted her head curiously, her lips parting in confusion. “I’m sorry, but… I think you must mean someone else. I haven’t seen Hermione tonight. I did show her my ring earlier today, though… when she stopped by the factory.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom ran his tongue over his teeth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, his blood ran cold.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He glanced over her appearance. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The witch he’d seen earlier wore a deep teal gown, whereas the Winifred before him was garbed in pale, ice blue.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom’s cheek muscles rippled, and he felt his heart begin to pound against his ribs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Excuse me,” he muttered, then turned sharply and began to make his way to the stairs, his stomach turning.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He climbed the steps rapidly and then stood on their designated balcony, gazing down at the event’s attendees.</span>
</p><p>
<span>His eyes caught on Dumbledore, who stood in a sectioned off area near the stage, chatting with Minister Moon, Supreme Mugwump Santos, and Newt Scamander.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom noted that MacNair and Nott were not in attendance, and in particular, neither was Malfoy, which was surprising to Tom, considering that he was a member of the Wizengamot and would be required to sign off on the Ministerial candidate who won the election.</span>
</p><p>
<span>None of the Blacks were in attendance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom’s hackles began to rise, his urgency mounting as he turned to search the hallways of the third level where he’d last seen Hermione.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As he made his way through the maze of corridors, throwing out tendrils of his magic in search of her own, he nearly ran into Gaspard Dufresne.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The wizard took him by the shoulders to halt him in place. “Whoah, there, where are you headed? These areas belong to the Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes and are off limits-“</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, I bloody well know that,” Tom gritted through his teeth. “I’m looking for Hermione.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Gaspard paused, then cocked his head. “Shouldn’t she be at the celebration?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom ground his teeth. “She’s not. She disappeared with Miss Haywood, but apparently they haven’t spoken tonight. It’s none of your business, just let me look for her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Gaspard’s brows knit, concern leaking into his usually blank blue eyes. “Actually, Mr. Riddle, as the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, it is my business if a ministerial candidate is missing. When did you last see her?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom shoved down his frustration, his fear becoming a tangible thing, a terror which he was unacquainted with that crawled along his skin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was a hole in his chest, sucking the air from his lungs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He turned and looked back at where he’d come from. “The top of the stairs. She spoke with Miss Haywood and then ran off with her. Said she’d only be a moment, but it’s been over an hour and a half.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dufresne gave a curt nod. “I’ll inform security. Moon is about to give a speech. Keep looking, hopefully we can locate her before the results are announced.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom swallowed as Dufresne turned on his heel and disappeared down the hallway.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He stood for a moment, seething in anger, tempted to curse the entire room. Then, he trained himself to pause, to close his eyes, though his heart beat violently in his chest, and he called out to Hermione through their faint bond, casting his magic out through the air.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hermione,” he whispered. “Where are you, little witch?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was nothing but ringing silence. An empty void.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He took a deep breath.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Darling</span>
</em>
<span>, he thought, willing his voice to reach her. </span>
<em>
<span>Answer me, and I’ll come for you.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>He waited impatiently, willing himself to stay calm, pulling upon that coldness he had always called friend, the stony inner walls he had carefully built, impenetrable as obsidian, which allowed him to separate his emotions from his ambitions.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He found that they were no longer at his command. His mind raced, his soul screaming for its mate.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Something was wrong.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He navigated the corridors of level three and found his way back to the balcony where he scanned the crowd once more.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He saw Dufresne speaking with several members of magical security.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then his eyes landed again on Dumbledore.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Feeling a prompting, something inexplicable which he likely would have combated if he weren’t so desperate, Tom raced to the stairs and descended them two at a time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He fought through the crowd, eliciting several exclamations of “Oh!” and “Watch where you’re going!” He at last reached the stage and was admitted into the private area by magical security. He strode up to Dumbledore, who wore a set of elegant umber dress robes. The older wizard glanced at Tom as he approached through his half-moon spectacles and gave a tight smile. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Greetings, Tom.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Headmaster,” Tom replied impatiently. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do call me Albus, my boy. We are to be family soon, are we not?” He gestured to the wizard who stood next to him. “I was just informing Mr. Scamander of your engagement to my daughter. He’s just returned from a trip to Madagascar. He was commissioned by MACUSA to perform extensive studies on the magical creatures native to the island, and he was looking forward to meeting Hermione so that they could discuss his findings. You know how passionate she is about magical creatures,” he chuckled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can’t find her,” Tom said sharply, his frustration boiling over.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dumbledore dipped his head, looking at Tom over his spectacles. “What do you mean, you cannot find her?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before Tom could reply, a sound interrupted their conversation. They turned to find Minister Moon, having already ascended the steps to the stage, and was currently tapping his wand to his voicebox, drawing the attention of the room. A hush fell over the crowd as all eyes turned toward him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dumbledore’s eyes were trained on Tom with intensity as Minister Moon’s voice boomed through the antechamber by way of an amplification charm, “Greetings, most prestigious guests and Ministry of Magic personnel…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom leaned over to Dumbledore and whispered, “She disappeared with someone and I haven’t seen her since. I don’t know who. They were under polyjuice I suspect.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dumbledore’s eyes sharpened. Tom flicked his eyes at his former professor, and he read the distress in the older wizard’s eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dumbledore and Tom looked up to the stage, where Dufresne stood behind Minister Moon, but the law enforcement officer’s eyes were following the countless aurors who had discreetly left the celebration and were making their way to the various levels of the Ministry in search of Hermione.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We have to find her, Tom,” Dumbledore whispered, the urgency evident in his tone. “Where could she be?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom shook his head, baffled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom knew she had enemies. But who would be so bold as to kidnap her on the night of the election?</span>
</p><p>
<span>A thought came to Tom, and it made his skin crawl with dread.</span>
</p><p>
<span>His heart pounded, mouth growing dry as he pressed into the inkling, his wand hand tightening into a fist.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The sounds of Minister Moon’s words faded into the background, echoing in the chambers of Tom’s subconscious as he entered into an alternate plane, pressing into a magical realm where a piercing cry rang out, infusing Tom’s soul with strength and fortitude.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Seraphina,” he whispered. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Suddenly, a murmur arose from the crowd. Tom looked up to see several attendees whispering and pointing. Then, a collective gasp, accompanied by exclamations and a rising clamor.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Minister Moon continued to drone on, unaware of any disruption.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom’s eyes lifted, up past the many levels of the Ministry, up to the enchanted glass ceiling. There, he saw two brilliant creatures, one gold and one crimson red, their bright wings beating in tandem… </span>
</p><p>
<span>Seraphina and Fawkes dove quickly toward Tom and Albus, their penetrating songs slicing through the atmosphere as the party-goers murmured and shouted, moving aside lest the beautiful but fearsome birds should attack.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tom’s head whipped to the side to meet Dumbledore’s gaze. Albus’ eyes were keen and grave. He gave Tom a nod of agreement, and in that instant, they both lifted their arms, their hands grasping into the fiery feathers of the phoenixes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>With a thunderous clap, they disappeared into a burst of flame, only leaving behind one of Tom’s silver serpent cufflinks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Magnificent,” muttered Newt Scamander. “Bloody magnificent.”</span>

<p>Gaspard’s cerulean eyes combed the audience, searching for any sign of foul play, anyone who shouldn’t be there, the absence of anyone who <em> should </em>be there, seeking anything that might seem amiss. </p><p>Luckily, the ostentatious departure of Riddle and Dumbledore, though shocking, had been passed off as part of the night’s entertainment. </p><p>Gaspard thought back to the look on Riddle’s face as he hemmed him up in the corridor.</p><p>He was sure that Riddle had something to do with Hermione’s disappearance. If not directly, then indirectly, which was just as bad in his book.</p><p>If Riddle continued to take part in dangerous and illegal activities, then he’d better be able to protect Hermione, or Gaspard would make it his responsibility to intervene and do so himself.</p><p>His resolve to separate himself from her was quickly crumbling.</p><p>His aurors combed the upper levels of the ministry as Minister Moon continued his speech, then welcomed the night’s MC, the famous quidditch announcer Uriah Smith. </p><p>“Voting booths have officially closed on Diagon, Vertic, and Horizont Alley!” He announced amid cheers from the celebrants. “The final booth in Kettel Court is closing in approximately…” He slipped his pocketwatch from his suit coat and clicked it open. “… two minutes!”</p><p>Murmurs of excitement and anticipation rose from the crowd. </p><p>Smith held his cherrywood wand to his voicebox and shouted, “Bring forth the owls!”</p><p>A parliament of owls flew into the grand atrium, hundreds of birds circling in formation around three enormous glass vessels. Each owl dropped a ballot into a vessel, and with each vote cast, a colorful light filled the glass container.</p><p>Beneath the banner bearing Hermione’s image sat a vessel rapidly filling with a brilliant red light.</p><p>Gaspard swallowed, having half a mind to use the ministry’s geolocational magic to track Riddle’s wand to wherever those phoenixes had taken them.</p><p>He said a silent prayer, begging whatever powers existed to preserve their new minister, wherever she may be…</p><p> </p><p>—————-</p><p> </p><p>With a soft click, quite a far cry from the thunderous way in which they’d disappeared from the ministry, Tom and Dumbledore apparated into a dark, damp place and immediately felt a pervasive chill in its stale, unmoving air. Tom stumbled for a moment before he regained his balance, the ground being rough and uneven beneath his usually nimble feet.</p><p>He narrowed his eyes as they adjusted to the darkness, the only light being cast by lanterns which lined walls of jagged rock, dimly lit and in sharp contrast to the bright ballroom they had just left.</p><p>Dumbledore cleared his throat and muttered a gruff, “Lumos.” White light flared brilliantly from the end of his wand, illuminating what appeared to be a large cavern. Fawkes and Seraphina flew to a rocky ledge nearby and perched, preening and cleaning their feathers.</p><p>“Do you know where we are, headmaster?” asked Tom , reverting back to the mannerisms of his school days.</p><p>Dumbledore cut his eyes at Riddle. “If my eyes are not deceiving me, we appear to be at the mouth of the Gringotts tunnels. Have you never been here before, Tom?”</p><p>Irritation speared through his panic at his former teacher’s use of his first name. Every professor he’d known referred to him as Mr. Riddle, but Dumbledore insisted on calling him Tom.</p><p>He pushed down his displeasure as his eyes began to adjust, and he realized that if he had stumbled much more to the right, he would’ve fallen into a deep rocky canyon, one which was lined with vaults and spiraling iron tracks. Several more tunnels were carved out of the rock in the canyon, the meager light from the lanterns revealing their entrances. </p><p>As he gazed into the stygian blackness below him, wondering why Hermione’s phoenix had brought him here, he muttered impatiently, “I never had any money growing up, so there was no use for a vault. I’ve never set foot in this place.”</p><p>Dumbledore eyed him curiously for a moment, so Tom continued coldly, “I despise goblins. Why wizards ever chose to trust them with their wealth is beyond me.”</p><p>“We can at least agree upon that,” said Albus as he cast a few detection spells. He crossed the platform upon which they stood to test the foremost cart which the goblins typically took into the tunnels.</p><p>“We need a goblin to take us further,” Dumbledore sighed. “Fawkes and Seraphina undoubtedly sense that Hermione is here somewhere.”</p><p>Tom exhaled his frustration. “They couldn’t have brought us any further than this?”</p><p>“Gringotts magic is old and peculiar. No doubt they would have brought us closer if they could have.” </p><p>Tom turned around to note that they were just beyond a high security door forged of goblin-made steel. On the other side of the door was presumably a flight of stairs which led to the lobby of the bank. The carts which were lined up before them would bring them deeper into the depths of the bank’s tunnels.</p><p>Only the touch of a goblin could activate the cart’s mechanisms. </p><p>“Wherever she is,” Dumbledore said gravely, “we can assume she is in danger.”</p><p>Tom’s chest tightened with fear. “Of course, she is. Can’t you just go out into the lobby and-“</p><p>Tom cut himself short as realization dawned on him.</p><p>If Hermione was in the depths of Gringotts, then whoever took her needed a goblin to do so…</p><p>… Which meant that either a goblin had been imperiused, or worse… </p><p>It was the goblins themselves. </p><p>They certainly would have a vendetta against her.</p><p>Tom’s heart sank into his stomach and his veins iced over.</p><p>Surely the goblins were not so brash as to act against the future Minister for Magic…</p><p>Dumbledore watched as the full impact of his realization sank in. Tom swallowed.</p><p>“We have to hurry,” he muttered, mouth dry as he began to frantically search for another way into the tunnels.</p><p>“We can’t get back through that door, in any case,” Dumbledore remarked. “It won’t open for us. We will have to wait for a goblin to come through.”</p><p>“We can’t wait!” snapped Tom.</p><p>Dumbledore raised an eyebrow.</p><p>A violent stream of air escaped Tom’s nostrils. “Can’t we apparate?”</p><p>Dumbledore shook his head. “Of course not. There is an anti-apparation enchantment in place.”</p><p>“Bloody hell.”</p><p>“Language,” said Dumbledore calmly. </p><p>“Forgive me, <em> Headmaster </em>,” Riddle spat caustically, any attempts at deference forgotten in his vexation. “But it’s Saturday evening. The bank is closed.”</p><p>“The goblins work tirelessly. Their greed for gold keeps them here at all hours, counting and recounting their coffers and their profits.” He looked at Tom over his spectacles. “Someone will come.”</p><p>“And what if it’s the goblins themselves who are conspiring against Hermione?”</p><p>“We will deal with that when the moment arrives… and we will alert the ministry, namely Gaspard, and he will handle it. It is his job.”</p><p>Tom scoffed and shook his head. “Always so ethical.”</p><p>Dumbledore paused and stared at the younger wizard. “Have you something you’d like to say to me, Tom?”</p><p>Tom’s gaze was hard as his eyes fell upon his former teacher, black irises flecked with shards of crimson. Suddenly, as if the bottom had fallen out of a storm cloud, the fear and desperation Tom felt manifested in his rage toward his one adversary.</p><p>A man he’d feared, hated, and at one time, secretly admired, and a man who would soon, whether Tom liked it or not, become his father-in-law.</p><p>He hated Dumbledore, but even more so, he hated that he had always craved his approval in some twisted way, as if Dumbledore’s disapproval somehow cemented the fact that he didn’t belong in the magical world, that there was something wrong with him, that he didn’t quite fit the standard in magical society.</p><p>“You’ve always been so lofty, Headmaster. So much better than all of us… everyone acts as if you’re some hero, always chasing higher ideals, but I think you’re really just chasing your own ego, your own ambitions.”</p><p>Riddle shocked himself with this speech, but his rage had a razor sharp edge with Hermione in danger and he felt helpless. Until he knew she was safe, his fear would be a rampant wildfire, consuming everything in its path.</p><p>Albus was quiet in the face of Riddle’s caustic fury, his expression pensive as he returned his former student’s gaze. Drops of condensation fell around them, echoing in the damp cavern.</p><p>After a moment, Dumbledore replied, “You’re perhaps right, Tom. You’ve always possessed a perception far beyond the average wizard. But what you fail to realize is that there are limits to what I will do in pursuit of my own ambitions. Boundaries. A moral code, one might call it. Have you any limits, Tom, to your pursuit of power?” His blue eyes took on a hard glint, both sharp and penetrating.</p><p>Tom’s jawline stiffened. “I suppose Hermione has shown you some things with regards to the future.”</p><p>“Perhaps. Perhaps not.” </p><p>The two wizards were quiet, with the sounds of a rushing waterfall reaching them from somewhere down below. The thief’s downfall.</p><p>Finally, Tom spoke. </p><p>“<em> Hermione </em> is my limit, Headmaster. If anything happens to her… this world will most certainly have cause to fear me.”</p><p>Dumbledore’s eyes were as cold as the underbelly of an iceberg as he looked upon Riddle.</p><p>After a moment, he took a deep breath. “I fear that I went wrong with you, Tom. Perhaps, one day, you can forgive me my shortcomings, or any perceived hurts that I’ve inflicted. It is possible that in my pursuit of what you deem <em> higher ideals </em>, I’ve been woefully neglectful of the responsibilities that I have right in front of me. You’ll have to forgive me. I do try my best.”</p><p>Tom scoffed. “We don’t see eye to eye, Headmaster. I don’t have faith that it will ever change… but I am willing to maintain civility for Hermione’s sake. In any case, I’m not going to stand around and wait any longer. Even if a goblin does come through that door, I doubt it will matter since we don’t know where she’s been taken. I’m going to find her.”</p><p>Tom withdrew his wand and began to etch protective runes into the rocky ledge, chanting incantations as he went. Dumbledore watched him with furrowed brows for a moment until realization washed over his features. </p><p>“Are you going to do what I think you’re going to-“</p><p>“If you’re thinking the dark arts, then yes.”</p><p>Dumbledore threw his hands up in exasperation as Riddle knelt in his circle, slipping his wand into his suit coat. “If a goblin walks through that door while I’m gone, you’d best handle it, Headmaster. I don’t care what you have to do, but if I return and find an ounce of resistance, then I’m going to deal with it my way, whether that means casting an unforgivable, cutting off said goblin’s limbs, or creating goblin Inferi. As you’ve already stated, I have no limits.”</p><p>Dumbledore arched an eyebrow, but said nothing as Tom laid down in the circle and closed his eyes.</p><p>Just before he began to project, Tom opened his eyes and muttered, “Don’t possess my body while I’m gone.”</p><p>Dumbledore rolled his eyes. “I shall try my damnedest to resist the urge.”</p><p>“Language,” hissed Riddle, then he closed his eyes and cast his soul into the realm of spirits. </p><p>———————</p><p> </p><p>Hermione suddenly became aware of the abrasion of rough-hewn rock against her skin. She shifted slightly, wincing as the rock scraped her bare back. </p><p>Then, she heard voices, slightly muffled and coming from her left.</p><p>Alarm spread through her as she attempted to remember what had happened that evening. All she recalled was being at the banquet with Tom, then following after Winnie, the excitement and rush of the election bubbling over in the center of her chest. </p><p>Then, darkness. </p><p>She was certain she was no longer at the Ministry. </p><p>Her heart suddenly began to beat erratically, adrenaline pumping through her veins in a way that she hadn’t experienced since the battle, since being on the run with Ron and Harry.</p><p>She swallowed back the thick bile that threatened to rise. </p><p>Muffled voices reached her ears once more. She took a deep breath, willing herself to intuit her surroundings. She pulled upon her magical core as Riddle had instructed her, pairing her magic with her intellect to find a way out of this situation, whatever that might be.</p><p>She feared to open her eyes, lest there be someone nearby who would notice she was awake. </p><p>She tuned in, listening to the voices.</p><p>She recognized the tenor and soprano of a man and a woman. No, two men, as there were two different male voices. She strained her hearing, but couldn’t make out what they were saying. It sounded like an argument.</p><p>Finally, she peeked through slitted lids, and found herself lying on her back, staring at a rocky ceiling covered in stalactites. </p><p>Her brows furrowed. She dared not to turn her head, so she cut her eyes around the area, and what she saw in the dim light shocked her.</p><p>There were mountains of galleons sitting all around her, in addition to a myriad of large upholstered chests. She saw heaps of treasures cascading down the mountains of gold, and what appeared to be countless, very <em> ancient </em> magical artifacts. </p><p>She had never seen so much wealth in all her life, not even in the Lestrange vault. It seemed like the kind of legendary treasure that pirates would spend their entire lives searching for.</p><p>Gringotts? She would know those stalactites anywhere.</p><p>Despite the rapid thumping of her heart, she shifted slightly, attempting to search for her wand, but she found that her arms were restrained.</p><p><em> Rats </em> , she thought. <em> A full body bind </em>.</p><p>Since the time when Tom had broken her full body bind curse, she had asked him to show her how he did it. He had obliged, explaining the mechanics of such magic, but she had never fully tested her abilities until now.</p><p>If she could get free and find her wand, she could fight against her captors.</p><p>She retreated into herself and pulled upon her magical strength, focusing on the counterspell. Her wandless magic had improved dramatically under the tutelage of Dumbledore and Riddle, but she hadn’t tested it under duress since the battle two years ago…</p><p>Still, she had progressed by leaps and bounds since then. </p><p>She took a deep breath and closed her eyes, focusing on her magic, on the spell and its adverse, touching upon her magical core and letting it envelop her, allowing her magic to begin to slide across her skin like silk, flooding through her veins like a powerfully brewed draught.</p><p>She felt when the curse broke, when the invisible tethers binding her limbs began to snap, one by one. </p><p>Then, she was free. Elation burst through her body, the matchless feeling of victory. </p><p>She slowly reached for the holster on her thigh, feeling for it through her gown, but found that her wand was gone.</p><p>She paused, her sense of triumph all but dwindling in an instant.</p><p>She silently agreed with Tom on his stance regarding wandless magic. It seemed pretty vital right about now.</p><p>She vowed to make amendments to the Hogwarts curriculum if she were to be elected…</p><p>That is, <em> if </em> she made it through the night.</p><p>The voices grew louder, signaling a building argument.</p><p>Hermione gingerly reached for her wrist and found her beaded bag still attached.</p><p>Relief washed over her. Surely there was something in her bag that she could use. She mentally began to take stock of the contents of the bag.</p><p>She could now hear the voices more clearly, their owners forsaking caution due to their frustration.</p><p>“It should be <em> legilimency </em>,” came the voice of a male.</p><p>“Veritaserum is safer,” came the female’s voice.</p><p>“Veritaserum is detectable in the bloodstream for days,” said a thinner, more hollow voice. </p><p>All three voices sounded strangely familiar to Hermione.</p><p>“Then we keep her until it’s safe to release her,” said the woman. “Then… we imperius her auror friends and watch her world crumble.”</p><p>Hermione scrunched her nose, trying to place the woman’s voice.</p><p>“I still think legilimency is best. It’s straight forward, and-“</p><p>“And your wands could be searched,” said a third male, whose words accompanied his approaching footsteps. Their voices seemed to be coming from the other side of a heap of treasure. “Do you fancy being chucked in Azkaban like I was?”</p><p>Hermione’s heart stopped. </p><p>Dolohov.</p><p>The first male laughed, and Hermione instantly recognized his laughter. </p><p>Malfoy.</p><p>“Can you imagine a Malfoy being sentenced to Azkaban? The Wizengamot would intervene. No, it would never happen.”</p><p>“You say that now, but-“</p><p>“Oh, shut it! Both of you!” The woman snapped. “Too much talk, not enough execution. She’ll be awake any moment. Now what are we going to do?”</p><p>“Legilimency,” said Malfoy.</p><p>“What if she’s an occlumens?”</p><p>“We both attack at once. She can’t fight us both off.” He paused, then added, “We obliviate her after.”</p><p>“What about Tom?” asked Dolohov.</p><p>“The only way to retrieve her memories is through the cruciatus,” said the woman with a leer in her tone. “And he would never torture his <em> precious </em> Dumblewhore.”</p><p>When she sneered the way she did, Hermione instantly knew who she was. </p><p>Walburga Black.</p><p>Hermione wasn’t surprised that Walburga was part of this, but Abraxas Malfoy?</p><p>For some reason, she found that unsettling.</p><p>Why would Malfoy aid Walburga in a petty lover’s vendetta?</p><p>“Listen here,” said the thinner voice of the second male. The voice was familiar, but she couldn’t place the owner. “I was told I would have revenge. To my kind, revenge means blood. I don’t care about your little plot to ruin her reputation. I want <em> real </em> recompense.”</p><p>“No blood will be spilt,” Malfoy said firmly. </p><p>“I’m certainly not opposed,” said Walburga, a hint of laughter in her high-pitched voice.</p><p>“Sure, go ahead, if you want Tom to sever your head from your body and stick it on a pike in the Black Lake,” muttered Dolohov. </p><p>“Tom won’t know,” she said with assurance. “He can’t know.”</p><p>“If everyone can just keep their heads,” Malfoy hissed, “Everything will go to plan and Tom will never know.”</p><p>“He can’t find us here, can he?”</p><p>“Only a goblin can enter these tunnels,” said the male with the thin voice. “My cousins will see to it that no wizards are allowed into the vaults today.” </p><p>Suddenly, Hermione knew who the voice belonged to. Her eyes grew as wide as saucers.</p><p>Kogrod. Her former co-worker at The Daily Prophet.</p><p>They were planning something sinister, and had been for some time, and Kogrod had been enlisted to help.</p><p>Hermione couldn’t waste any time. She needed the advantage.</p><p>A thought struck her, and whilst she was laying on the other side of a mountain of galleons, she took the opportunity to engorge her beaded bag wandlessly and summoned Harry’s invisibility cloak. </p><p>Then, she sat up quickly and nearly threw the cloak over herself, but she stopped short as dizziness overtook her. It took her several moments for her blackening vision to subside.</p><p><em> I must have been dosed with some sort of sleeping draught, </em> she thought. </p><p>As she threw the cloak over herself, she desperately wished she had her wand.</p><p>“I still don’t think we should use legilimency. What if our wands are searched?”</p><p>“I will do it,” offered Kogrod. </p><p>There was a slight pause, and then Walburga burst into laughter. “A goblin performing legilimency? Unheard of.”</p><p>“Go ahead and laugh, witch. We goblins will have the last laugh one of these days.”</p><p>“How on earth are you going to perform legilimency without a wand?”</p><p>“We goblins have been perfecting our wandless magic for centuries. Since the Wand Ban of 1707. If you wizards had any interest in creatures beside yourselves, you would know that.”</p><p>“Clearly we haven’t been managing you all closely <em> enough </em>,” hissed Walburga. “Seeing as how you’ve all been stealing gold from us right under our noses.”</p><p>“Like I’ve said, if you arrogant wand-wielders cared about any-“</p><p>“Enough!” shouted Malfoy. “This isn’t the time for petty spats. The goblin and I will perform legilimency. I will use Hermione’s wand to circumvent prior incantato.”</p><p>Hermione’s heart beat like the wings of a hummingbird. She inched slowly about the tower of treasure and peered around to look at her captors.</p><p>Sure enough, she caught sight of Malfoy and Kogrod, a squat elf with sooty black tufts of hair on either side of a bald patch, a long, hooked nose, and deep, olive toned skin. His back was turned to Hermione, and he stood beside another wizard whom Hermione presumed was Dolohov, though he wore a mask and hooded cloak.</p><p>The sight of Walburga shocked Hermione at first, because she bore the spitting image of Winnie Haywood. </p><p>Hermione’s skin crawled as she realized that the witch she’d encountered at the election banquet hadn’t been Winifred at all, but Walburga Black under the influence of polyjuice potion. </p><p>Her stomach turned at how easily she’d followed after her, and all the while it had been a trap.</p><p>Hermione eased closer, but cringed when she heard a crunch beneath her feet.</p><p>She looked down to see that she had stepped on a pair of galleons, but to her relief, they weren’t cursed with the Gemino spell. </p><p>Her kidnappers didn’t seem to have noticed.</p><p>She looked past them, to the heavy vault door to discover that it was sealed shut with a complex magical lock.</p><p>It would require a goblin to open it.</p><p>She was trapped.</p><p>Hermione’s heart rose into her throat as she realized she would have to fight, and fight hard.</p><p>There was no way that Tom could reach her down here.</p><p>Malfoy must be the one in possession of her wand, since he planned to use it to perform legilimency. If she could somehow wrest it from him…</p><p>Hermione gathered her strength and fortitude and stood beneath the cloak, painstakingly moving closer, careful not to step on any of the countless objects littering the floor.</p><p>The cloak dragged along behind her, but was still light as a feather, not hanging on any of the objects but gliding smoothly over like silk.</p><p>Her captors were still arguing.</p><p>“It’s too suspicious to kill her, goblin,” said Dolohov. “It’s far too dangerous.”</p><p>“Then you’d better succeed in what you plan to do, because the only way to restore the honor of the goblins is to completely discredit her,” said Kogrod grumpily. “I want what was <em> promised </em> to me.”</p><p>“And you shall have it. We need only to access her memories. She is surely hiding something,” interjected Malfoy.</p><p>“What if she’s not?” Walburga piped in. “Do we kill her then? Something has to be done about her.”</p><p>“No!” snapped Malfoy. “Certainly not. We will simply find another way to make Tom… see <em> reason </em>.”</p><p>“We both know that won’t happen, Brax,” muttered Dolohov. “Tom does what he wants to do. There’s no reasoning with him, not unless you want to feel the brunt of his cruciatus. Now get over there and rennervate her. Let’s get this over with. Find out what she’s hiding and take her back home before Tom finds out.”</p><p>“Where’s the polyjuice?” asked Malfoy. “Better safe than sorry.”</p><p>Hermione was now only feet from her captors. She leaned back against the wall, thinking quickly on her feet, for they were moments away from discovering that she was no longer on the ground where she’d been left. </p><p>She eyed Kogrod. He was her only means of escape. It was his hand that could free her from the vault.</p><p>Hermione watched as Malfoy gulped down the potion and subsequently changed forms, his handsome appearance melting into that of a squat redheaded man.</p><p>He took hold of Hermione’s wand and rounded the corner, where he would discover she was no longer bound. </p><p>Hermione watched in horror, her heart thudding against her ribcage, knowing that her only advantage was the invisibility cloak, and her only defense, the magic at her own fingertips.</p><p>Just as Malfoy and Kogrod were discovering her absence, Hermione decided to act. She bent down and lifted the cloak, holding out her hand from beneath its edge, wandlessly summoning her wand from Malfoy’s hand. </p><p>It shot directly into her waiting hand and she hastily pulled it beneath the cloak.</p><p>Her plan wouldn’t work without her wand.</p><p>Her kidnappers were now looking around the dimly lit vault with bewildered expressions, wands drawn. </p><p>“Where are you, Hermione?” shouted Abraxas. “We just want to talk, nothing more.”</p><p>Hermione said nothing, refusing to give away her location. She held her wand straight out and closed her eyes, and began to focus her mental strength on the spell. </p><p>“Where are you?” Walburga asked innocently. “It’s only me, Winnie.”</p><p>All at once, Hermione had the perfect series of mental images in place, and with a smile, she swished her wand and whispered, “<em> Hallucidorus totalus</em>!”</p>

<p> </p><p>Tom flew through the stifling expanse of the cavern, casting his magic across the deep, rocky chasm in search of Hermione.</p><p>He reached the other side of the caves, which contained the entrances to three tunnels, each of which was lined with vaults.</p><p>He felt nothing as he gazed at the three archways, their blackness seeming mournfully empty, void of Hermione’s warmth and light.</p><p>He turned, feeling drawn away. He scanned the various levels of the cavern and their stony ledges which bore carts on iron tracks, smaller vaults, and more tunnels.</p><p>His inhuman eyes slid downward, gazing into the Stygian abyss below. The tether which bound him to Hermione seemed to tighten, tugging him downward, toward the darkness of the pit.</p><p>He dove deeper, letting his soul free fall into nothingness, descending into the pitch black chasm.</p><p>When he neared the bottom, he began to hear a strange, animalistic sound… not a growl, but something he’d never heard before. He felt the impression of his hair standing on end, skin crawling with warning.</p><p>Tom felt the tether tightening, a feeling of warmth beckoning, something pulling him further, deeper into the darkness. </p><p>He needed light.</p><p>His sense of urgency peaked, so he closed his eyes and began to chant the incantation to summon the body of darkness, calling forth the blackest, darkest energy into his soul. He molded it as it filled him, channeling it into a corporeal form, giving it arms and legs, giving it hands, giving it <em> substance </em>.</p><p>When he had fully shifted, he sent a ball of light forth from his hand. The sphere of light, like a translucent moon, drifted away, trailing through the darkness and illuminating the contents of the pit.</p><p>The space appeared to be empty until the glowing orb slowed, revealing a wall of pale ivory. Slowly, it ascended, climbing higher as it highlighted the uneven texture of the wall. </p><p>Tom’s hackles rose, and he stepped forward with eyes narrowed, feeling a hint of dè ja vu, but for what, he couldn’t recall.</p><p>Then, the wall moved.</p><p>Tom retreated several steps, watching as the wall seemed to turn, pivoting to reveal spiny, bone-like protrusions.</p><p>Tom suddenly had a realization, and, as if in answer to his thoughts, the light moved to reveal immense wings emerging from the back of an enormous <em> creature </em>. The roughly textured wall was no wall, but a patchwork of metallic scales. His eyes followed the tail of the creature, which was lined with pronounced spikes and then he saw them…</p><p>Two red eyes gazing at him from the darkness.</p><p>—————-</p><p>Hermione stood beneath the invisibility cloak against the wall of the Malfoy vault.</p><p>She knew that it belonged to the Malfoy family, because she’d seen a chest of gold engraved with an enormous dragon, the Malfoy crest.</p><p>She cast all of her will and intention into the spell  as she whispered, “<em> Hallucidorus totalus </em>!”</p><p>Suddenly, there were upwards of twenty clones of herself standing around the cave.</p><p>She heard Walburga gasp and shout, pointing at one of Hermione’s clones, only to realize there were many, all with their wands aimed directly at her kidnappers.</p><p>Hermione kept her focus on the illusion, and suddenly her clones lifted their wands and began to cast spells.</p><p>Walburga shrieked and threw up her shield. Kogrod disappeared, hiding behind a great chest of galleons, while Malfoy and Dolohov began to fend off her remaining clones.</p><p>Hermione moved swiftly, climbing over magical artifacts, mountains of treasure, costly jewels, solid gold cups, and historical scrolls. She cursed the dress she’d worn that night, holding the train over her arm to ensure that it didn’t show from beneath the cloak.</p><p>In frustration, she kicked off her heels and used a hex to cut the train away. Then, she bent over and ripped the dress away, freeing her legs.</p><p>The ruckus proved to be a brilliant distraction, as her captors were confused and caught off guard, forced to battle her clones, which were nothing but a carefully devised illusion.</p><p>It bought her time, but for how long, she couldn’t say, so she moved quickly.</p><p>She scanned the vault for Kogrod, but he’d retreated even further away, and the cavern was enormous. Not only that, but the vault appeared to have tunnels which led to other caves. Hermione shivered to think of what those caves might contain.</p><p>“Which one is she?” shouted Dolohov to Malfoy. “Where did they all come from?”</p><p>“I’m not familiar with this kind of magic,” panted Abraxas as he blocked a stunner.</p><p>Walburga was duelling two of Hermione’s clones, but in between shielding and casting, she searched the vault for any sign of Hermione.</p><p>Hermione finally caught sight of Kogrod, kneeling behind a great silver throne with emerald velvet upholstery.</p><p>He was only a few feet from the door. His beady black eyes watched the proceedings with no intention of aiding his partners, fully prepared to flee as soon as things went awry.</p><p>She internally cursed him; he reminded her a great deal of Griphook.</p><p>She set out toward the goblin, determined to use him as her means of escape.</p><p>Dolohov’s eyes suddenly caught on the cascading treasure as Hermione trudged through it like quicksand. He cocked his head, then lifted his finger, pointing to where Hermione blazed a trail through the gold. “There! Someone is moving!”</p><p>Hermione internally cursed, realizing she’d been spotted, so she waved her wand as she ran, whispering the incantation once more as she altered her illusion.</p><p>Walburga’s scream rent the air.</p><p>“Burgs!” shouted Dolohov, and he suddenly made haste toward the witch he cared about as she fell to the ground, blood spurting from a wound on her chest.</p><p>Hermione’s heart nearly thumped out of her chest as she finally reached Kogrod.</p><p>“Confundo!” she hissed, temporarily disabling the goblin’s mental capacities. Lifting the cloak, she threw it over his head, took his hand, and began to drag him along with her toward the vault entrance.</p><p>“That’s not me, you idiot!” Walburga shouted at Dolohov from across the cavern. </p><p>Dolohov was bent low over a wounded clone of Walburga, confusion and alarm painting his features as he attempted to stem the bleeding.</p><p>“Oh, you fool! You’re falling for her trickery,” Walburga spat disdainfully as she blocked two more spells from the clones. </p><p>Just as she lobbed two more curses, both of which the clones deftly shielded against, Walburga noticed the clones glitching, fading momentarily as if they were merely ghosts. </p><p>Walburga’s brow furrowed in bewilderment. She turned to leap over several piles of treasure, then climbed a heap of gold to gain a better vantage point.</p><p>Then she saw it.</p><p>A hand, floating in the air, being dragged downward along the complex lock in the iron door, its mechanisms triggering and clicking as its magic responded.</p><p>Walburga’s eyes narrowed, and she immediately slid down the hill of galleons and took off running toward the vault door.</p><p> </p><p>—————-</p><p> </p><p>As he stared at Riddle’s soulless body, Dumbledore began to fear that Tom might be right.</p><p>In all likelihood, the goblins themselves had conspired against Hermione. Goblins were vindictive creatures by nature, and Hermione had made enemies for life by uncovering their greed and deceit.</p><p>Rather than stand idly by while Riddle searched for his daughter, Dumbledore raised his wand.</p><p>“<em> Expecto patronum </em>,” he chanted, producing a silvery bird from the end of his wand. </p><p>A beautiful Phoenix emerged, spreading his flaming wings and beating them as he hovered in the air above Dumbledore.</p><p>When Albus beckoned, the bird flew closer, allowing him to whisper instructions into his ear.</p><p>Then, the bird flew straight through the heavy steel door and into the lobby of the bank.</p><p>Suddenly, Tom’s eyes opened.</p><p>He wasted no time in jumping up from the ground and immediately crossed to the ledge, gazing down into the abyss.</p><p>“Did you find her, Tom?”</p><p>Riddle didn’t answer.</p><p>To Dumbledore’s immense surprise, Riddle took a giant step, and jumped off of the cliff.</p><p>Dumbledore’s eyes bugged out of his head and he leaned over the ledge as far as he dared, listening for an impact that never came.</p><p>“What in Godric’s name is he doing?” he muttered to himself, shaking his head. “He’s always been theatrical.”</p><p>He would be very angry indeed if Tom ran off to rescue his daughter without him.</p><p>He sighed, waiting for his patronus to return.</p><p>A few more moments went by, and then Albus began to hear a sound echoing from the rocky chasm below him.</p><p>He bent forward, peering over the ledge, but there was only thick darkness as far his eyes could see.</p><p>Still, the sound grew louder.</p><p><em> Whoosh </em>. </p><p><em> Whoosh </em>.</p><p>It was the sound of flapping, or perhaps a strange wind, blowing in all directions.</p><p>A sinister groaning issued forth, as if it were coming from the belly of a beast.</p><p>Dumbledore caught the faint scent of smoke.</p><p>At that moment, his patronus returned. Dumbledore turned to see the silvery Phoenix fly through the steel door, but the alarming sounds were growing louder, and when Albus turned back to the edge of the cliff, he was met by a terrifying and awe-inspiring sight.</p><p>A monstrous dragon emerged from the shadows of the pit, its enormous wings, though thin and skeletal, beat in unison, creating a vicious wind that blew Dumbledore’s beard back over his shoulder. </p><p>The dragon was pale, with milky red eyes, metallic scales, and talons that glistened like serrated knives.</p><p>Upon its back… sat Tom Riddle.</p><p>“No,” Dumbledore said with a firm shake of his head. “Absolutely not.”</p><p>The dragon, which was comparable to the size of an entire quidditch pitch, landed on the ledge, shaking the cavern and causing the stone to crumble in several places.</p><p>“I know where she is,” Riddle called from above. “We have to go down to the base of the tunnels.”</p><p>Albus replied, “That is where the high security vaults lie.”</p><p>“She’s in the Malfoy vault,” said Tom angrily. “I can feel her there. I just can’t get inside. We need a goblin.”</p><p>Dumbledore gazed at Riddle. His eyes glowed like hot pokers, red as the eyes of the dragon he rode. His anger was tangible, the fury of one who has been betrayed. It leaked from him, and Dumbledore could feel dark magic and untempered rage as it poured off of his person.</p><p>Albus beckoned for his patronus, tilting his head to the side as the bird squawked in his ear.</p><p>“According to my patronus, there are two goblins and two wizards guarding this door. If they indeed saw my patronus, they will undoubtedly come to learn who it belongs to.”</p><p>The dragon perched on the ledge, but turned its head away from the light of Dumbledore’s wand, no doubt only used to darkness and conditioned to be afraid of light-bearing creatures.</p><p>“The dragon is nearly blind,” Riddle said as he dismounted. He shook a clanger back and forth as he did so, ensuring that the dragon stayed subdued.</p><p>“It suffers much abuse,” Dumbledore murmured, gazing solemnly at the creature.</p><p>As Dumbledore had predicted, the door began to crack. They could hear the locks clicking open, and they each hid in the shadowy recesses on either side of the door.</p><p>The heavy steel door whined, and two cloaked wizards stepped through the opening, accompanied by one goblin.</p><p>The tallest of the men let out a petrified shout as he spied the dragon perched on the ledge.</p><p>Tom slammed the door shut and turned on them with his wand drawn. Black vines shot out of his wand, wrapping themselves around the goblin in a tight, unbreakable vice.</p><p>The two wizards turned in alarm, and Tom caught sight of their faces for the first time.</p><p>“M-my Lord-“</p><p>Fear shone in their eyes.</p><p>Dumbledore drew his wand on Acacius Nott, who threw his hands up in terror at being threatened by Albus Dumbledore.</p><p>Tom reached out and gripped Macnair by the throat, slamming him against the steel door.</p><p>“Tell me why I shouldn’t kill you right now,” he gritted through clenched teeth, his hand involuntarily tightening around his death eater’s throat.</p><p>“My… Lord,” rasped Macnair, but he was steadily losing air, teetering on the verge of losing consciousness. “Sh-shouldn’t you be at the Ministry?”</p><p>Tom threw him to the ground and immediately lifted his wand.</p><p>“<em> Crucio </em>!”</p><p>The wizard’s screams pierced the stagnant air, drowning out Dumbledore’s protests.</p><p>“Untie me,” shouted the goblin. “I can take you to her!”</p><p>Tom broke the curse and reached down, fisting Macnair’s robes to jerk him off the ground. He rammed the tip of his wand into his follower’s temple and hissed, “<em> Legilimens </em>.”</p><p>Moments went by in eerie silence, only broken by Nott’s mournful pleas for mercy.</p><p>“Tom,” said Dumbledore as calmly as he could manage. “There’s no time. We must be hasty.”</p><p>“No worries,” said Tom coldly. He lowered his wand. “I’ve seen enough.”</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Tom reared back, and the thick sole of his dragonhide boot connected powerfully with Macnair’s chest, shoving his death eater over the edge of the cliff.</p><p>“Riddle!” Dumbledore snapped, rushing over to the ledge. “Are you out of your bloody mind?” </p><p>He pointed his wand into the blackness as a Macnair’s scream could be heard echoing through the canyon. “<em> Arresto momentum </em>-“ </p><p>“<em> Protego </em>!” countered Riddle with snake-like swiftness, voiding Dumbledore’s rescue attempt.</p><p>They heard Macnair’s scream for only a split second more before the sound ended abruptly.</p><p>The two wizards stood facing one another, each knowing that they’d find Macnair’s broken body at the base of the pit.</p><p>Dumbledore gazed at Tom with every bit of fury and judgment that he could muster.</p><p>Tom gazed back stonily, then lifted his forearm to wipe the sweat from his forehead. He sniffed, then muttered, “He fell.”</p><p>Acacius Nott had sunk to his knees as he stared at Tom with a horrified expression, mouth agape.</p><p>“You… you <em> killed </em> him, you brute!“</p><p>“Are you ready to go next?” Tom asked, eyes narrowed and fixed on Nott. </p><p>“I have no idea what’s going on, I swear it!” Nott mumbled amid tears. “Look into my mind! Malfoy told me to guard the door, and that’s all that I know. I swear it, on my bloodline!”</p><p>Dumbledore rolled his eyes. “We don’t have time for this.” He lifted his wand and shot a stunner at Nott, effectively rendering him unconscious.</p><p>Tom stared at his death eater for a moment, his jaw muscles rippling in anger.</p><p>Then, he bent down and held his wand to Nott’s temple. “<em> Obliviate </em>.”</p><p>Turning away, his eyes rested on the goblin who was still bound. “We either take <em> him </em> ,” Tom said sharply to Dumbledore, gesturing to the goblin. “Or we take his <em> hands </em>.”</p><p>The goblin suddenly began to curse and jerk, writhing against his restraints.</p><p>Dumbledore sighed. With a swish of the elder wand, he levitated the goblin into the air.</p><p>Tom blinked, and without another word, he turned toward the dragon and began to climb up, using its scales for leverage.</p><p>Riddle motioned Dumbledore to come up, using the clanker to ensure their safety.</p><p>“We will talk about all of <em> that </em> later,” Dumbledore warned as he climbed up along the dragon’s tail and onto its back.</p><p>“Hurry up, old man,” Riddle hissed, as he pointed his wand at the dragon’s head. “<em> Imperio </em>.”</p><p>Dumbledore, quite exasperated at this point, huffed as he levitated the goblin onto the dragon’s back, “I’m losing count of how many times you’ve broken the law tonight, Tom. I think I shall have to challenge you to a duel when this is all over to teach you your place.”</p><p>The dragon mounted up and they gripped tightly to the spines on its back as it began to dive into the depths of the canyon.</p><p>“I do what needs to be done, Headmaster.”</p><p>“There are better methods, Tom.”</p><p>“Yet, you’re not stopping me,” Tom remarked.</p><p>Deeper and deeper they flew into the pit, passing myriad tunnels and vaults.</p><p>“I’m observing the kind of wizard my daughter is intent on marrying.”</p><p>The dragon finally reached the base of the canyon, where no light shone, save for a small, barred window carved into the ceiling of the rock, which admitted a speck of moonlight whose rays became lost on the shadows. Tom swished his wand, illuminating its tip in a wordless <em> lumos </em>.</p><p>Riddle gave a sardonic chuckle. “We both know you’ve had your mind made up about what kind of <em> wizard </em> you think I am, years ago, Headmaster.”</p><p>Tom steered the dragon, causing it to turn into a massive tunnel as it beat its wings with much effort, emaciated as it was.</p><p>Dumbledore was silent for a moment. Then he muttered, so low that Tom almost couldn’t hear him over the sound of the dragon’s wings, “You’ve changed much under my daughter’s influence… and I daresay, so have I.”</p><p>Tom said nothing in response as he contemplated Dumbledore’s words.</p><p>They rode farther into the tunnel, bypassing the Lestrange vault, then the Black vault, then the vault belonging to the Tuft family.</p><p>“Clearly you haven’t changed enough though,” Dumbledore added, causing Tom to snort.</p><p>Adrenaline coursed through Tom’s veins as they drew closer to the Malfoy vault. </p><p>
<em> Be safe, little witch. I’m coming for you. </em>
</p><p>“Whatever possessed you to wrangle a dragon, Tom?”</p><p>The corners of Riddle’s lips twitched. “Hermione once broke into Gringotts and escaped on dragonback. I thought it would make for a good story once this is over.”</p><p>Dumbledore chuckled. </p><p>“Definitely didn’t happen,” muttered the goblin.</p><p>“Hold your tongue,” Dumbledore commanded. “Before we feed you to the dragon.”</p><p>Tom grinned against his will.</p><p>“This might be a bad time to say this,” interjected the goblin. “But I don’t have security clearance for these vaults. I can’t get you in.”</p><p>Dumbledore sighed his frustration.</p><p>Riddle hissed over his shoulder, “You’re going to wish you’d never said that, goblin.”</p><p> </p><p>——————————</p><p> </p><p>Hermione lifted Kogrod’s hand and slipped it out from under the invisibility cloak. </p><p>She heard the sounds of duelling behind her, but she stayed laser focused on her goal. If she could get out of the vault before they noticed, she could bring the goblin to a cart and get away safely.</p><p>She began to drag Kogrod’s hand across the complex magical locks.</p><p>A moment later, she heard the clicks and twists of locks coming apart, and she internally sang for joy. </p><p>“Oh my,” mumbled a confunded Kogrod. “It’s been years since I set foot in one of these vaults! I do miss this old bank, best place on earth to keep your galleons.”</p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes as she pulled on the door’s iron bar, utilizing all of her weight to move the heavy, maximum security steel, but just as the door was cracking open, she was suddenly yanked backward by her hair. </p><p>“Going somewhere?” </p><p>Walburga Black yanked the cloak away, then tossed it aside. Hermione felt an arm tightening around her throat and a wand being shoved beneath her chin. “That was a nice little diversion, but your luck’s run out. Are you ready to cooperate now?”</p><p>The feral witch dragged Hermione away from the door, snatching her wand away. “Max! I have her!”</p><p>“Oh, this is a <em> nice </em> vault, isn’t it?” mused the goblin.</p><p>“Won’t you shut up?” Walburga snapped. With a wave of her wand, she countered Hermione’s <em> confundus </em> charm.</p><p>Hermione jerked against the strength of Walburga’s hold. Her illusion weakened and then faltered, her fear causing a lack of focus.</p><p>Malfoy and Dolohov came running.</p><p>“Take her, Max,” Walburga instructed. “I’ll perform legilimency myself. I want to feel the <em> fear </em> in her heart.”</p><p>Dolohov smirked as he approached. “So, we meet again, Miss… Dumbledore, is it? Well, I suppose we’re going to find out for certain.”</p><p>Malfoy, though polyjuiced, gazed at Hermione somewhat regretfully as Dolohov held her at wand point, restraining her in his iron embrace.</p><p>“Goblin!” hissed Walburga. The polyjuice had faded, and it struck Hermione that Walburga looked eerily similar to a youthful Bellatrix.</p><p>Just the memory of Bellatrix made Hermione’s adrenaline spike. </p><p>Kogrod came forward, a sinister smile on his face as he gazed at Hermione. “Finally… <em> recompense </em>.”</p><p>“No!” Malfoy called out as he advanced forward. “I will help you, Miss Black. Stand aside, goblin.”</p><p>Kogrod scowled at the blonde-haired wizard, but begrudgingly stood aside all the same, gesturing for Malfoy to take his place.</p><p>Abraxas swallowed thickly. </p><p>“Don’t do this, Abraxas,” Hermione pleaded. “You don’t understand what you’re doing!”</p><p>Malfoy shut his eyes.</p><p>“If you stop now, Tom <em> will </em> forgive you.”</p><p>He sighed deeply. “You’ve left me no choice, Dumbledore. This must be done, unfortunately.”</p><p>One tear slid down Hermione’s cheek as she bucked against Dolohov’s hold.</p><p>Malfoy held his wand aloft, aimed directly at the space between Hermione’s eyes.</p><p>Walburga followed suit, a vile leer playing on her full lips.</p><p>“<em> Legilimens </em>!” Their voices rang out in unison.</p><p>Hermione screamed as a bolt of pain seemed to split her mind in half.</p><p>It was a strange feeling, having two people violate her mind simultaneously. She attempted to block their entry, throwing up her occlumency walls, but the double onslaught proved too powerful. It was as if a road had been split in two, diverging into two tracks.</p><p>Hermione couldn’t even counter the assault; she was paralyzed, powerless to defend herself.</p><p>Malfoy and Black dove through her carefully occluded memories.</p><p>Walburga rifled through months of her relationship with Tom, shamelessly intruding upon her most private, most prized memories.</p><p>Hermione could feel Walburga’s rage as she touched on memories of their first kiss in Godric’s Hollow, memories from Christmas, from their time in Paris, watching snippets of their fight in Borgin and Burkes. Untempered fury washed over Walburga the moment Tom uttered the words, <em> I love you </em>.</p><p>Malfoy, on the other hand, pulled on his interactions with Hermione, examining her thoughts about him, and he was surprised to find thoughts about other Malfoys that he had no knowledge of… some wizards named Draco and Lucius.</p><p>He dove into those thoughts and discovered even more memories, one in which a very young Hermione, wearing strange clothing, punched a young blonde boy squarely in the jaw.</p><p>Hermione sensed Malfoy’s confusion.</p><p>Walburga finally discovered what she was searching for… a memory in which Tom and Hermione had discussed her time travel.</p><p>Hermione could feel Walburga’s cold satisfaction as she examined the memory.</p><p>Hermione resisted, fighting against Walburga’s assault with all of her might.</p><p>She thought to herself that if she made it through this, she would have Tom train her in occlumency. </p><p>If Walburga heard her thoughts, she didn’t react, because at that point in the memory, Tom waved his wand, revealing the scar on Hermione’s arm, </p><p>Walburga’s rage peaked.</p><p>Suddenly, Hermione felt a third intrusion pierce her mind. Pain shot like a lightning strike through her skull.</p><p>Hermione felt nausea roiling in her stomach, a feeling of disorientation, like she’d been tipped upside down.</p><p>Three separate tracks of memories were being violated and ripped from their hiding places in the depths of her consciousness.</p><p><em> Kogrod </em>.</p><p>He searched her memories until he settled on the one he was looking for.</p><p>
<em> Hermione, Harry, and Ron broke through the security of Gringotts. He saw it all, the imperius curse placed on the bank clerk, the betrayal of Griphook, the freeing of the dragon. </em>
</p><p>The memory was suddenly painted in a wash of red. Kogrod’s rage flooded her mind like a tidal wave, and suddenly, all three of her attackers broke their concentration.</p><p>“She’s a time traveler!” shrieked Walburga as she withdrew from Hermione’s mind, her face lit up with glee. “And a <em> mudblood </em>! What did I tell you two?”</p><p>“You slimey, no-good wand wielder… you- you <em> thief </em>!!” Kogrod snarled, marching forward with his hand outstretched.</p><p>Before Malfoy could intervene or even react, Kogrod spat out a curse. </p><p>“<em> Avada kedavra!” </em></p><p>“No!” exclaimed Malfoy in horror, but it was too late.</p><p>The curse shot out from his hand in a bolt of green, and seemed to hit Hermione directly in her chest.</p><p>Then, something strange happened.</p><p>Rather than sink into her body, the curse seemed to sit on the surface of her skin, circulating like an electric current along the conduit of her arms and legs, her teeth, her fingers, her hair.</p><p>“What in <em> Salazar’s </em> name…” muttered Malfoy, sufficiently shocked.</p><p>Walburga’s eyes grew wide with uncertainty.</p><p>A moment later, the curse seemed to be sucked into the emerald engagement ring on Hermione’s finger.</p><p>A moment of stilted silence passed, and then, in a brilliant flash of green, the curse shot out of her ring, seeming to search for its caster.</p><p>The killing curse hit Kogrod in the chest, then sunk into his body like poison.</p><p>His knees buckled, and the rage that had only moments ago shone in his eyes disappeared entirely, along with all signs of awareness.</p><p>He fell into a crumpled heap on the ground.</p><p>For a moment, everyone stood in stunned silence.</p><p>Then, Walburga shrieked and ran forward, gripping Hermione by the hair. She yanked her out of Dolohov’s hold and threw her onto the ground.</p><p>Hermione scrambled for purchase, trying to get to her feet but Walburga grabbed her by the ankle and jerked her back.</p><p>She pinned Hermione down, straddling her as she shrieked, “How! What magic protected you from the killing curse?”</p><p>“I- I don’t know!” Hermione shouted in frustration.</p><p>“Lies! Where did you come from, <em> mudblood </em>?”</p><p>“Walburga!” shouted Malfoy. “We have what we need. Let her go!”</p><p>As Hermione gazed up at Walburga, her mind played tricks on her, and she only saw Bellatrix. Her words caught in her throat, adrenaline coursing through her veins as she choked up. “I-“</p><p>“Since when is the <em> great </em> Hermione Dumbledore short of words? Minister for Magic over my dead body. Imagine how much Britain will <em> hate </em> you when they discover how you’ve lied to them all.” Walburga spat in her face. “You know, I might have taken him back at some point, before I knew he was fucking a mudblood. That is <em> disgusting… </em> Do you suppose it’s a fetish of his? Well, regardless… imagine wanting to sully one’s bloodline in such a way.”</p><p>Hermione’s eyes narrowed, fresh fury overpowering her fear for a moment. “This <em> mudblood </em> handed your arse to you in a duel last year.”</p><p>“You’re right,” Walburga hissed venomously. “I think it’s time I hand you yours.”</p><p>Walburga slid her hand beneath her dress and produced a blade. “Maybe I can’t curse you… but your magic won’t protect you against muggle weapons, will it? It’s not really my style, but if I must, I must.”</p><p>Hermione swallowed, struggling under Walburga’s weight, memories of Bellatrix’s assault rattling her composure.</p><p>Walburga snatched up Hermione’s arm, waving her wand to reveal the scar on her flesh. The feral witch’s eyes sparkled. “Who was it that carved this into your arm?”</p><p>Hermione shook her head violently, trauma threatening to choke her. “Let me go!</p><p>“Awww… what’s wrong, <em> baby </em>? Isn’t that what he likes to call you?” Walburga cackled, the Black madness seemingly taking over.</p><p>Hermione had always thought that it was Bellatrix Lestrange’s stint in Azkaban that caused her insanity, but she suddenly realized that was not the case.</p><p>The Blacks were cursed.</p><p>Walburga flipped over Hermione’s other arm. “Perhaps I should carve <em> whore </em> into this one… that way you’ll have a matching set.”</p><p>“Walburga,” Malfoy said in warning. He pointed his wand at the back of her head. </p><p>“Or maybe,” Walburga murmured under her breath. “<em> Maybe </em> I should obliviate him from your memory entirely…”</p><p>Hermione’s eyes grew wide, pupil’s dilating in terror. “No…”</p><p>“He’d be so <em> heartbroken </em> when he realizes you don’t love him anymore,” Walburga whispered, poking her bottom lip out in a faux pout. “I’d give anything to see his face when he realizes you don’t even <em> know who he is </em>.”</p><p>Hermione snarled, her anger finally reaching its zenith as she overcame her fear and trauma. </p><p>
<em> This bitch would never come between her and Tom. </em>
</p><p>Hermione had had <em> quite enough </em> of the <em> vile </em> women of the House of Black.</p><p>She leaned forward so that the tip of her nose touched Walburga’s cheek, and whispered in the witch’s ear, “<em> Hallucidorus, bitch </em>.”</p><p>Of a sudden, darkness descended…</p><p>For all, except Hermione.</p><p>Walburga shrieked as her vision went black no.</p><p>Hermione snatched her wand from Walburga’s hand and reared back, slamming her forehead into her adversary’s.</p><p>She was bound to have a headache anyway, after tonight.</p><p>She shoved Walburga off as the witch tried to scramble in the darkness. </p><p>Malfoy and Dolohov stood, bewildered and sightless, trying to see through the pervading darkness.</p><p>It was quite a comical sight, and Hermione watched them all for a moment, holding back laughter and thinking that she should have thought of this in the first place. </p><p>At last, she raised her wand and cast three stunners simultaneously.</p><p>“<em> Stupefy </em>!”</p><p>All three of her captors hit the ground.</p><p>Hermione didn’t waste a moment. She desperately needed to get back to Tom.</p><p>She cut her eyes back to the vault door to see that it remained slightly cracked.</p><p>Hermione dove toward it, scrambling over heaps of treasure in her haste to escape.</p><p>As she neared the door, a blast of heat scalded her skin. She grabbed the iron bar and heaved it open, though it was hotter than an iron poker. She yanked the door open, suffering burns on her hands, only to be greeted by a wall of flame.</p><p>She jumped back instinctually, fear gripping her. </p><p>Had someone cast the <em> fiendfyre </em> curse? </p><p>If that was the case, there would be no escaping alive.</p><p>She stared, mouth agape at the all encompassing flames, sorrow piercing her heart.</p><p>Then, she heard a familiar cry. </p><p>As she looked on in disbelief, out of the heart of the blistering fire, a massive dragon emerged…</p><p>The flames that had burst forth from its mouth dissipated, and she felt the wind in her hair as its massive wings beat in unison.</p><p>Then, she spied on its back, Tom and Dumbledore. </p><p>On either side of them flew Fawkes and Seraphina.</p><p>Hermione’s heart soared with joy.</p><p>Suddenly, Hermione was jerked back violently by her hair.</p><p>She screamed, feeling the sharp edge of a blade shoved crudely against her jugular. </p><p>“One way or another,” came the voice of Dolohov, a rough whisper against her ear, “Me and Walburga are walking out of here alive.”</p><p>“We’ll see about that,” Hermione said coldly, her eyes fixed on Tom as the dragon landed on the rocky ledge. </p><p>Tom wasted no time, he leapt from the dragon’s back and jumped to the ground. </p><p>As soon as his feet met the rocky floor of the cave, he was running. </p><p>“Don’t come any closer, Riddle!” shouted Dolohov.</p><p>Tom skidded to a halt just within the mouth of the vault, eyes fixed with intensity upon Hermione.</p><p>“Dolohov, you pussywhipped son of a bitch,” Tom shot back angrily. “I should’ve left you in Azkaban.”</p><p>“I just want to walk out of here with Burgs, Tom. That’s all. You’ll never see me again.”</p><p>“Like hell,” said Riddle scornfully. “I should rip your intestines out through your throat. Let her go, and I might grant you a bit of mercy.”</p><p>Dolohov’s eyes were fearful and crazed. He tightened his hold, the knife drawing blood as he carelessly dragged it across her skin. “Don’t make me do it, Riddle.”</p><p>Tom’s eyes stared at the place where the knife met her throat.</p><p>Dumbledore had dismounted from the dragon and immediately cast containment spells upon Malfoy and Walburga, who were just beginning to regain consciousness. Spheres of water enveloped them like cages, trapping them in.</p><p>Dolohov watched Dumbledore nervously. “She goes free,” he bargained.</p><p>Tom’s gaze never left the knife.</p><p>Then his eyes met Hermione’s. </p><p>
<em> Trust me. </em>
</p><p>She heard his voice through their bond, and prepared herself for action.</p><p>Tom hissed a command, some kind of spell in parseltongue, and suddenly the knife transfigured into a hissing black serpent.</p><p>Dolohov shouted in surprise and let go of the asp, but not quickly enough. The serpent wound itself around his wrist and sunk its fangs into his hand. He screamed, attempting to shake the serpent away, but its fangs seemed to penetrate deeply, down to the bone.</p><p>Hermione managed a sharp jab to his ribs with her elbow, allowing her to extricate herself from his grasp. She ran to Tom, launching herself into his arms.</p><p>Tom wrapped one arm tightly around her, releasing his breath in relief, and with the other, he stretched out his hand and all at once, Dolohov burst into flames.</p><p>Hermione turned and watched in astonishment as the wizard was burned alive, his hoarse, tortured screams echoing throughout the cave.</p><p>Dumbledore stood by stoically, his wand lifted to sustain the magic containing her remaining captors. He made no move to help Dolohov.</p><p>“Are you alright, little witch?” Tom ran his hands over her face, her shoulders, his fingers ghosting along her skin, checking her gown for blood, her skin for wounds.</p><p>“I’m fine,” she murmured, suddenly overwhelmed by a feeling of pure exhaustion. Her head felt split in half, and her muscles were tight, constricted with the force of her fear.</p><p>Tom pulled her close, and she rested her forehead on his shoulder.</p><p>He kissed the top of her head, then looked across the room at Dumbledore. “Let them go.”</p><p>Albus dropped his wand, causing a giant splash of water that coated them all in a million tiny droplets.</p><p>Dolohov had fallen amid a heap of galleons, incinerated into naught but a pile of cinder, a faceless cadaver, black and crisp as fireplace ash.</p><p>As soon as Walburga hit the ground, she turned and began to flee, scrambling toward the opening of one of the vault’s tunnels. </p><p>Dumbledore shook his head and sighed heavily as he conjured a fiery whip from the tip of his wand. He cracked the whip, snagging Walburga’s ankle in its grip, then dragged her back, kicking and screeching.</p><p>Albus proceeded to cast a full body bind, rendering her unmoving and silent.</p><p>Malfoy didn’t attempt to flee or to fight. He dropped his wand and sank to his knees, intent on pleading for mercy.</p><p>Tom pulled away from Hermione and advanced on Malfoy swiftly, wand drawn.</p><p>Black vines shot out of his wand, constricting Malfoy’s arms and legs.</p><p>“Tom!” Hermione called out. “Tom, wait! Don’t kill him!”</p><p>But Tom was already upon him with vengeance blazing in his crimson eyes. He cast no curses, resorting not to the killing curse, nor the cruciatus. </p><p>He wrapped his pale hands around Malfoy’s throat, and slammed his head against the rocky floor.</p><p>Tightening his hold mercilessly, he constricted Malfoy’s windpipe, seeing nothing but red, nothing but <em> justice </em> being served, his compulsions forcing him to act, to <em> punish </em>, to end this wizard’s pathetic existence as was well deserved for his betrayal.</p><p>“Tom!” Hermione screamed. “Stop!”</p><p>She shoved at his shoulders, his arms, but he was like a statue of stone, immovable, a serpent whose fangs were fatally sunk into its prey.</p><p>She grabbed his head and turned his face to hers. </p><p>“You <em> can’t </em> kill him, Tom. Please <em> listen </em> to me! Snap out of it!”</p><p>His eyes were a crimson so dark, they were nearly black.</p><p>She felt the same feeling she once felt after the ritual at Riddle House… preternatural strength, the atmosphere of dark magic, thick and stifling, the sense that Tom was channeling something… <em> other </em>.</p><p>“Tom,” she pleaded. “Please.”</p><p>Tom blinked once, then twice.</p><p>Then, he relinquished his hold.</p><p>Malfoy gasped, then coughed, struggling to suck in a ragged breath.</p><p>“Tom,” Hermione hedged. “If you kill either of them, it will devastate the timeline. Trust me on this. They <em> must </em> live.”</p><p>“The timeline has already changed, Hermione,” Tom growled in frustration, a hint of darkness in his voice.</p><p>Dumbledore laid a hand on Tom’s shoulder. “Hermione is right, Tom. If she insists they must live, then that is that.” He squeezed Tom’s shoulder. “Don’t you think you’ve killed enough people tonight? Why don’t you give it a rest?”</p><p>Hermione gave Tom a disapproving glance.</p><p>Malfoy continued to cough and sputter. Dark purple marks, the evidence of Tom’s abuse, began to color the pale skin of his throat.</p><p>“They both deserve to die for this, Hermione. I cannot let this go.”</p><p>“I understand, but you cannot kill them, Tom. Too much would change.” She ran her hands over his face in a soothing motion, from temple to cheek. Then she took his hand and pulled him away slowly, putting distance between Tom and his follower. “Hasn’t Abraxas been your closest friend?”</p><p>“No,” said Tom acidly as he glared at Malfoy. “He isn’t… and clearly never was.”</p><p>Malfoy dropped his head into his hands.</p><p>Hermione looked exasperated. Her eyes slid back and forth as she tried to think quickly and on the spot. </p><p>Would it be so wrong if Lucius Malfoy were never born? She certainly had no love for him whatsoever. </p><p>But then, Draco would also not be born.</p><p>
<em> Would that be so bad? </em>
</p><p>The thought made her guilty, despite the fact that he had deliberately tried to kill Dumbledore in sixth year.</p><p>Perhaps she was being swayed by the look of sadness and defeat on Draco’s face as she, Harry, and Ron had met with him at the Ministry… the day he bequeathed the golden trio with chests full of gold from Bellatrix’s vault.</p><p>No, Draco wasn’t all bad. Perhaps without the influence of Voldemort, he could’ve been a good person.</p><p>She doubted it, but the uncertainty of it all made her uncomfortable.</p><p>She sighed. “Don’t kill Malfoy, Tom.”</p><p>Tom’s expression snapped with anger. “At the very least, Hermione, he needs to be put in prison. Removed from the wizengamot-”</p><p>“No,” she murmured, shaking her head vehemently. “No, he can’t go to Azkaban. It will change the timeline too much.”</p><p>“It has already <em> changed </em>, Hermione!” Tom hissed in frustration. “Dramatically, I would say.”</p><p>“Forgive me,” Malfoy gulped, then he rasped, “My Lord…”</p><p>Tom’s head snapped back to Malfoy. He advanced on his second-in-command and bent down, yanking on the vines that held him like ropes, bringing them face to face.</p><p>“Don’t call me that,” he spat poisonously. “You are <em> dead to me </em>, Malfoy. You would be dead already if it weren’t for the mercy of my fiancée.”</p><p>“She’s <em> changed </em> you, my Lord! I’ve always been unyielding, my loyalty has <em> never </em> wavered.”</p><p>Riddle stared at him coldly. Despite the furious rush of adrenaline through his veins, he found that he was as calm as the arctic sea as he looked at his former school friend. </p><p>Suddenly, a jarring epiphany struck. He realized with striking clarity that he had, for too long, kept one foot in the world of the purebloods, and one foot in the world of Hermione Granger.</p><p>Tom had always been a creature of habit, and somehow he had convinced himself that he could coexist in those two worlds simultaneously. He’d continually told himself that there would be no need to choose.</p><p>He’d convinced himself that he was powerful enough to keep their loyalty, their <em> fear </em>.</p><p>Clearly, they didn’t fear him <em> enough </em>.</p><p>Now, the reality of the situation was staring him in the face.</p><p>“No, Malfoy,” Tom said slowly. “I’m no longer your Lord. We are not friends. We are not brothers. You are no servant of mine.”</p><p>“I’ve taken your mark-“</p><p>Tom dropped him to the ground instantly and waved his hand, conjuring a knife. “You’re absolutely right, Malfoy. You no longer deserve that mark. I will abide by Hermione’s wishes but she cannot begrudge me this.”</p><p>He dragged the knife down through the ropes of vine, slicing them to free Abraxas from their confines. </p><p>“W-What are you doing?” Abraxas croaked.</p><p>“<em> Petrificus totalus, </em>” Tom muttered, rendering Malfoy frozen, though his eyes widened with fear.</p><p>“Tom…” Hermione said nervously from behind him. “What <em> are </em> you doing?”</p><p>Tom didn’t answer.</p><p>He lifted Malfoy’s arm, gazing at the mark engraved into his arm in red ink. Then he placed the knife just below his follower’s elbow, and began to apply pressure.</p><p>“Tom!” Hermione screeched.</p><p>But there was no stopping him. He began to hack away at Malfoy’s flesh, blood spurting wildly as he sliced through skin, muscle, and tendons, dragging the serrated knife mercilessly. </p><p>Then he met bone.</p><p>Malfoy, under the full body bind, could not even scream, but his eyes spoke of immense pain and torture, never leaving Tom’s face until they finally closed tightly, tears leeching out from beneath his lids.</p><p>The sound of metal hacking through bone caused Hermione’s stomach to turn. She turned away, covering her mouth as Dumbledore wrapped her in his embrace.</p><p>Then, just like that, it was over.</p><p>Tom held the severed arm in his hand as blood dripped and pooled on the stone. </p><p>He tossed it onto the ground.</p><p>“There,” Tom spat acidly. “You have no loyalties left, no ties to me.” He bent down and yanked Abraxas up by his collar. “If you transgress against me, my future wife, or anyone else in my circle again… you will be dead, Malfoy. Even Hermione won’t be able to save you then.”</p><p>Then he bent closer, so that his voice was but a whisper in Malfoy’s ear. “Even though I can’t kill you, I can destroy you in a million other ways. You had best tread very, very lightly.”</p><p>By the time Tom finished speaking, Abraxas had lost consciousness, likely due to the intensity of the pain and loss of blood.</p><p>Hermione approached, reaching into her beaded bag to produce a small vial of Dittany.</p><p>She winced as she poured several drops of the essence onto the open wound, stemming the bleeding of the jagged stump, which was all that was remaining of Malfoy’s arm.</p><p>Meanwhile, Tom had crossed the vault to where Walburga was lying, frozen and restrained by Dumbledore’s curse.</p><p>“The <em> loyalty </em> of the Blacks… that’s what you promised me,” said Tom, his face twisted with fury. “Is this the sort of payment I get for hearing your desperate pleas?” Tom pointed at Dolohov’s incinerated corpse. “Now look where you’ve got him.”</p><p>Dumbledore aimed his wand at what was left of Dolohov, and suddenly a strong wind began to blow upon the body, causing the remains to turn to ash and disintegrate into the air like snow.</p><p>Then, the older wizard conjured his Phoenix patronus, and sent the bird off to fetch Gaspard and his aurors.</p><p>Tom stuck his tongue against his cheek and then with a sigh, he muttered, “<em> Legilimens </em>.”</p><p>Through Walburga’s eyes, he watched the entire encounter. </p><p>When he had finished, he lowered his wand and glared at Walburga.</p><p>“Threatened to carve up my witch, is that right?”</p><p>Hermione had finished with Abraxas after giving him a blood replenishing potion and a sleeping draught. She came to stand behind Tom warily.</p><p>Tom knelt down and took Walburga’s arm, jerking the sleeve of her dress up. “Perhaps I should carve you up instead, you psychotic cunt.”</p><p>As he gazed down at her arm, he caught sight of a canvas of small scars, starting at her wrist and ascending up to her elbow.</p><p>There were faded ones, then newer, darker scars, and on top of those, there were freshly healed cuts, pink and puckered.</p><p>Tom’s cheek muscles rippled. “Well, it seems as if you’ve already carved <em> yourself </em> up.”</p><p>He released her arm and it dropped like it was made of lead.</p><p>Her eyes were narrowed as she watched Tom and Hermione.</p><p>Tom turned to Hermione. “You say she cannot die?”</p><p>Hermione shook her head. “Do you remember Harry’s godfather?”</p><p>His jaw stiffened, but he nodded. </p><p>“He’s Walburga’s son. If you kill her, he will never exist.”</p><p>Tom blinked several times, then sighed impatiently. “What do you suggest I do with her, then? I can’t just let them go free, Hermione…If only for the sake of your safety alone.”</p><p>Dumbledore cleared his throat. “Might I suggest an unbreakable vow?”</p><p>Tom’s eyes narrowed. </p><p>Hermione’s eyes lit up. “Of course, Albus! That’s it. If they want to leave here with their lives, they must take a vow.”</p><p>Tom’s red eyes came to rest on Hermione, then he sighed in defeat. “Fine. First, the vow. Then, obliviation.” He turned to Walburga. “You threatened to wipe me from my witch’s memories, but I’m positive that’s what <em> you </em> need, Black. I think it’s time for you to forget about me, once and for all.”</p><p>———————-</p><p>After coercing an unbreakable vow from both Abraxas Malfoy and Walburga Black at wandpoint, which stated that they would never again seek to harm Hermione Dumbledore or her reputation, Dumbledore set about obliviating Malfoy while Tom wiped Walburga’s memories.</p><p>Tom did away with every encounter between himself and Walburga, wiping their entire six year relationship, and he especially made sure to clear her mind of every vendetta against Hermione.</p><p>“She will be happier this way, Tom,” said Hermione softly. “She will finally be able to let you go.”</p><p>“I don’t care about her happiness, little witch. I’m only concerned with yours.”</p><p>Hermione watched as Tom incinerated the body of Kogrod.</p><p>“You enchanted my ring, didn’t you?” Hermione asked, subtly side-eyeing Tom.</p><p>He gave a barely perceptible nod. “I did.”</p><p>She was quiet as she gazed down at the emerald on her finger. Then she murmured softly, “Thank you.”</p><p>Everything this wizard did was to protect her.</p><p>Misguided as they were, she realized that his actions last January were only for her safety… and perhaps they weren’t entirely unfounded.</p><p>“I’ve still got two more bodies to take care of before the aurors get here,” Tom sighed.</p><p>“Two?!” Hermione exclaimed. Then, a realization dawned on her features. “Good gods, Tom! I’ve got to be at the Ministry!”</p><p>He shook his head. “No. You’re not going anywhere tonight. You can face the public tomorrow… as the new Minister for Magic.”</p><p>“We don’t even know the results, yet.”</p><p>He took her hand, bringing it up to his lips. “I’d bet all my galleons on you, little witch.”</p><p>Hermione watched him as he tenderly pressed his lips to her fingers. Her lips parted, whiskey brown eyes sparkling with adoration for this dark wizard.</p><p><em> Her </em> dark wizard.</p><p>His eyes flicked to hers, glittering with a devious playfulness.</p><p>“Fancy a dragon ride, darling?”</p><p> </p><p>———————</p><p> </p><p>That night, Hermione and Tom laid in bed on their sides, facing one another. Tom’s hand idly stroked her thigh, and her leg was thrown over his waist.</p><p>They had both collapsed into bed and slept for a few hours, but Hermione awoke in the early hours of the morning, when all the world was still hushed and under cover of darkness.</p><p>“Were you scared, Tom?” she whispered softly.</p><p>He blinked slowly. “Yes.”</p><p>“So was I.”</p><p>Tom’s jaw stiffened, and his adam’s apple bobbed as he swallowed. “I should’ve been more vigilant… that never should’ve happened.”</p><p>“I would’ve died if it hadn’t been for your ring. You think of everything. What exactly does the ring do?”</p><p>Tom ran his tongue over his top teeth, clearly unsatisfied with the way the night had ended. “It absorbs dark curses, and causes them to rebound on the caster.”</p><p>“When did you have time to learn that kind of magic?”</p><p>He laughed softly. “I had that ring custom made after a <em> certain </em> night at Malfoy Manor.”</p><p>“You mean the night you cast a spell on me without my consent?”</p><p>He smirked. “I like to think of it as the night you admitted that you belonged to me.”</p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes. “You’re still so proud of that.”</p><p>His lips twitched. “Then I enchanted the ring on the day I found out you’d accepted the auror position.”</p><p>“Ah, I see. You were worried about me.”</p><p>“Clearly, I had cause to be.”</p><p>“Yes, but not because of the auror job, mind you. It happened to be your own followers.”</p><p>“I’m no longer calling them that, Hermione. I want no further association with the lot of them.” His expression was bitter. </p><p>Hermione fell silent. </p><p>How much Riddle had changed. </p><p>“Albus said that you killed people. Who did you kill, Tom?”</p><p>Tom cleared his throat. “Ahh… Macnair.”</p><p>Hermione gasped.</p><p>“Might’ve also shoved a goblin off the dragon’s back.”</p><p>Hermione’s mouth dropped open.</p><p>“Then, there’s Dolohov, of course.”</p><p>Hermione stared at Tom for several moments, then took in a measured breath. “I never thought I would see the day when Dumbledore would help to cover up your murders.”</p><p>Tom snorted. “Don’t be fooled, little witch. Dumbledore’s living vicariously through me.”</p><p>Hermione burst into laughter.</p><p>Tom’s lips curled into a slow grin as he watched her. </p><p>After a moment, she mused, “I wonder why they brought me to Gringotts?”</p><p>Tom took a deep breath. “I think they intended to blame the goblins for the incident. They wanted to use them as scapegoats.”</p><p>“Which is, ironically, what we are going to do,” Hermione said wryly.</p><p>“Good riddance.”</p><p>After a moment, Hermione sobered. </p><p>“Um, Tom? I just thought of something.”</p><p>His eyes flicked to hers, as if he’d been waiting for her to broach the topic.</p><p>“Is… Does… Does Kogrod’s death count as murder?”</p><p>Tom had been waiting for her to ask.</p><p>He pressed his tongue against his cheek, then took a deep breath.</p><p>“I guess what I’m asking is… Does this mean I have to make a horcrux?”</p><p>Tom tensed.</p><p>Then, he swallowed, and released his breath slowly. “Yes and no.”</p><p>Hermione bit her lip apprehensively.</p><p>Tom met her gaze, then answered, “You are indirectly responsible for the goblin’s death, yes. However…”</p><p>Her lips parted.</p><p>“I will release you from your end of the bargain, if it's not something that you truly want.”</p><p>Hermione stared at him in utter silence.</p><p>Her eyes traced the contours of his face, absorbing his masculine beauty, the sharply chiseled jaw, his keen and perceptive eyes.</p><p>She had fallen so deeply in love with this wizard that she often felt as if she were drowning.</p><p>Now, she could read the longing in his eyes.</p><p>He tried so carefully to mask it, but Hermione was well aware that he wanted her to make a horcrux more than anything else in the world.</p><p>But still, he was willing to let the choice be hers.</p><p>Hermione rubbed her lips together to keep from smiling.</p><p>He <em> had </em> learned a few things since their breakup.</p><p>Hermione swallowed. “I was thinking… Perhaps we can alter our deal, just slightly. Just a small amendment.”</p><p>Tom was still as a statue, every ounce of his attention fixed on her in that moment. </p><p>“I am willing to make the horcrux, Tom… but there’s one more thing I’d like you to agree to.”</p><p>Tom’s eyes narrowed. “What more could you possibly ask of me?”</p><p>She bit her lip. “I want you to agree, that if either of us ever finds a way to undo the horcruxes… provided that’s even <em> possible </em>... I want you to promise me that you will undo them with me, and… and piece your soul back together.”</p><p>Tom’s eyebrows knit sharply as he contemplated her request. He leaned forward and took her chin between his thumb and forefinger. “Are you concerned about my soul, pretty witch?”</p><p>She didn’t answer, but her warm brown eyes searched his face, pleading with her gaze. He leaned forward and kissed her softly. </p><p>As he pulled away, he muttered, “If you’re going to continue making demands, then I’m going to make one of my own. Another <em> amendment </em>.”</p><p>Her eyebrows lifted in question.</p><p>“I will agree to your new terms, particularly because I don’t believe there’s any way to undo a horcrux, but also…  I want you to take my dark mark.”</p><p>Hermione wrinkled her nose. “Like the one your followers have?”</p><p>Tom grinned devilishly as he dragged his fingertips across her skin. “Oh, no, love. It would be a very <em> special </em> mark, just for you.”</p><p>She cocked a jaunty brow. “So you can summon me at will?”</p><p>“I’ll take a mark as well.”</p><p>“Is this the equivalent of muggles getting couples tattoos? It’s death to any marriage.”</p><p>He smirked as his thumb stroked her nipple. “Think of it as, more or less, a direct line of apparation. A safety measure, of course, but it could certainly have other benefits as well.”</p><p>Hermione chewed her bottom lip, deep in thought. Then, she had a realization. “So… If I had had your mark tonight, you would’ve been able to come to me immediately?”</p><p>He nodded, pleased that she was grasping the concept.</p><p>“Well,” she breathed. “It certainly seems to have a lot of pros…”</p><p>“Are you making a pros and cons list in your head, witch?”</p><p>She rolled her eyes. “This is how I make decisions, if you don’t <em> like </em> it, you can bugger off.”</p><p>Tom grinned, then pulled her against him, spreading her thighs and wrapping them around his waist.</p><p>“I’m proud of you, little witch. You held your own. You are everything I could’ve ever dreamed of.” His voice was warm and husky against her ear. “December cannot come quickly enough.”</p>

<em> Great Britain has been waiting with baited breath for news about the welfare of their newly elected Minister for Magic, Miss Hermione Dumbledore. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Miss Dumbledore had been last seen with her fiancée, Tom Riddle, entering the Ministry’s election night banquet this past Saturday evening. </em>
</p><p>
<em> At 7:36pm, as the election votes were being tallied, it came to the attention of the DMLE that Miss Dumbledore was missing. All signs pointed to kidnapping. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Upon investigation, the Department of Magical Law Enforcement has determined that the goblins of Gringotts were to blame for Minister Dumbledore’s disappearance. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Due to the uncovering of their cursed gold plot by Hermione Dumbledore last year and the creation of a new wizarding bank, the bloodthirsty goblins sought vindication and revenge. </em>
</p><p>
<em> While only three goblins were present during the altercation, further investigation by way of legilimency has revealed that there were many goblins involved in this plot. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Two of said goblins involved were found dead at the scene. </em>
</p><p>
<em> The remaining offenders have been apprehended and now await trial in Azkaban prison. </em>
</p><p>
<em> As a result, Gringotts bank has been seized by the ministry, and hearings will be conducted over the summer to determine the future of the bank’s ownership. </em>
</p><p>
<em> For the time being, goblin rights have been revoked and will be carefully monitored going forward. </em>
</p><p>
<em> As for our new Minister, she is doing well, and sustained no wounds from the incident, according to Amelia Bones, head nurse at St. Mungo’s Hospital. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Her inauguration celebration is scheduled to be held one fortnight from Friday at the London home of the popular singer, Celestina Warbeck. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Hermione will be resting for the remainder of the week, but she is anxious to step up to the plate as Minister for Magic,” says Tom Riddle, Miss Dumbledore’s dashing husband-to-be.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Continued on page 24 </em>
</p><p> </p><p>———————</p><p> </p><p>Tom sat in a corner booth of the White Wyvern. Across from him sat Rosier and Rowle.</p><p>Hermione was at Hogwarts visiting with Dumbledore, so Tom wasn’t too concerned with her safety for the afternoon.</p><p>“Well, well, well…” Tom muttered acidly. “Here we are.”</p><p>“My Lord, I swear, I had no idea what they were planning,” said Rosier, his face pale. “I was right there with you and Winnie that night.”</p><p>Tom watched him for a moment, then his eyes flicked to Rowle.</p><p>“I’ll be honest, my Lord, I did hear them talking about her, and how they needed to do something, but… I thought it was just a lot of jawing about.. I didn’t think they would actually <em> do </em> something. Not with Dolohov already in piles of shit and Walburga having pledged her family’s loyalty…. and <em> Abraxas </em>! Salazar’s name…” he said, shaking his head in disbelief. “I swear I had no thought, not even a hint of an idea that he would have done something like this.”</p><p>Tom lit a cigarette.</p><p>“Yes, well… I may not be able to kill him… <em> yet </em>,” he said resentfully. “But rest assured, he is going to wish he’d never been born.”</p><p>Rosier gulped.</p><p>“We don’t need Malfoy,” Rowle spat. “He’s always been a bloody prat.”</p><p>Tom raised an eyebrow. “<em> We </em>?”</p><p>Rowle and Rosier exchanged glances.</p><p>Rowle cleared his throat. “We, uh… Edward and I decided it’s you we want to follow. Not the other lot.”</p><p>Tom’s eyes narrowed. “You would turn your backs on your fellow purebloods?”</p><p>They once again exchanged a glance.</p><p>“I mean… we technically already have,” said Rosier. “We’ve been… talking about a few things. Some things you’ve said, and… well, it bloody makes sense.”</p><p>Tom watched them both. “And?”</p><p>Rosier took a deep breath. “I’m going to marry Winnie, and once we are married, my father won’t have any power over me. Winnie’s mother is muggleborn, so I can’t rightfully support a regime that would have her family killed. Everything you said, the data you collected from St. Mungo’s… I want to believe it’s true.”</p><p>Tom nodded, inhaling snappishly from his cigarette, its end glowing cherry red. He exhaled a billow of smoke. “And what about you, Rowle? What’s your reason for switching up loyalties?”</p><p>His death eater stroked his moustache for a moment before muttering, “Well, I don’t see it as shifting loyalties, my Lord. I’m not a panderer, I don’t switch up easily. I pledged my service to you and took the mark, and that was my own choice, not simply because I was following the herd. I’ve never seen a wizard with such power as you, Riddle. Never. Not even Dumbledore can do the magic I’ve seen you do. No, it’s something else… I don’t know to explain it, but I just have a gut feeling that you’re meant to lead us into the future, to change things. However that looks, of course.”</p><p>Tom gazed at the death eater before him, with his blue eyes and brown hair. The man always had a gruff manner, and he was a quiet wizard, never opening his mouth unless he had something useful to say. Tom had always liked him, but kept it to himself. He treated the ones he liked even more harshly, when it was all said and done.</p><p>Tom took another drag from his cigarette. “That’s not the only reason, is it?”</p><p>His death eater shifted uncomfortably.</p><p>Tom ejected a stream of smoke. “You’d better come out with it, before I leave this table.”</p><p>Rowle nervously looked at Rosier.</p><p>“He’s in a similar boat that I’m in, my Lord,” muttered Rosier under his breath. “Just… slightly different.”</p><p>Tom’s eyes narrowed, and he looked between the two of them. “Out with it.”</p><p>Rowle cleared his throat. “My family wants me to marry a pureblood witch and carry on the legacy… But I don’t want to get married.”</p><p>Tom raised an eyebrow.</p><p>Rosier sighed. “He prefers wizards… to witches, my Lord.”</p><p>Tom’s eyebrows lifted. “Ah.”</p><p>“So,” continued Rowle, a wash of red painting his cheeks, “what does it matter to me who marries who? I’ll never carry on the name. I’ll never pass along my spotless blood. My father knows, but he still expects me to marry a witch and sire heirs, no matter who I choose to be with. But I’ve been told I must keep it hidden.”</p><p>Tom swallowed, nodding his head thoughtfully.</p><p>“So you see, my Lord,” continued Rosier, “This is all a bunch of nonsense. Looking down our noses at muggleborns and half-bloods, all while we entrust the future of our regime… <em> to a half-blood </em>? The hypocrisy of it all! What bloody sense does it make?”</p><p>“None,” Tom replied, sucking another drag from his cigarette. </p><p>“I honestly can’t believe I went along with it for as long as I did,” Rosier muttered with disgust. “I suppose it was when <em> you </em> started questioning it, that did it for me… it was like somehow it all broke off of me… I feel like I’d been in a bloody trance.”</p><p>“When I saw Rosier was engaged to Haywood… well, we just started having conversations,” said Rowle quietly.</p><p>“I see,” Tom said pensively.</p><p>“The only thing we aren’t sure about,” he continued, “is muggles.”</p><p>Tom ran his tongue over his top teeth. “Yes… that is a sensitive subject.”</p><p>“Do you still think the statute should come down?”</p><p>Tom took a deep breath through his nose. “Yes, and no. That is a conversation for another time.”</p><p>His death eaters watched him, and he caught something in their eyes which he did not expect to see, especially not pertaining to him: hope.</p><p>“So you two are pledging your loyalty to me, then?”</p><p>Rosier shrugged. “I don’t think we ever stopped serving you, my Lord.”</p><p>Rowle grunted. “Congratulations on your witch making Minister for Magic.”</p><p>Tom flicked the ash from his cigarette. “This changes nothing. We will duel as we always have. Legilimency on a regular basis. Bi-weekly meetings, as usual. Nothing will change except our numbers.”</p><p>They each nodded their assent.</p><p>“If I can get to the others,” said Rosier, “I will do my best to make them see reason.”</p><p>“No,” Tom said firmly as he put out his cigarette. “Let them go.”</p><p>They looked at him in surprise, but did not argue.</p><p>“We will discuss those traitors at another time,” he said, effectively severing the conversation. “But at the moment, I’m being tormented with wedding plans, and so I’ve decided to bestow upon the two of you, a great honor.”</p><p>They both glanced at one another, then gave Tom questioning looks. </p><p>Tom smirked, and tipped back his glass of firewhiskey. “Would either of you like to be in my wedding?”</p><p>———————-</p><p>As soon as Tom apparated Hermione to the ledge of the cliff, a harsh, wet wind eddied around them, smattering their bodies with a tumult of raindrops.</p><p>They stood on the precipice of a rocky cliff overlooking the turbulent sea, whose waters were black and churning restlessly, as if the spirit of the ocean had foreseen what this day would hold.</p><p>The gray sky darkened rapidly, and lightning struck the sea, sending a forcefield of electricity skittering across the surface of the water.</p><p>Hermione swallowed thickly, her heart rate increasing as she took in her surroundings.</p><p>Tom watched her warily, waiting for her to stop him, to change her mind out of fear.</p><p>But she didn’t.</p><p>Her chest heaved, and she stayed silent, her eyes falling upon the bay below, and across from where they stood, the mouth of a cave.</p><p>
<em> His cave. </em>
</p><p>He would never have brought her to such a dark place, no matter how significant it was to him… if he had not already created both of his previous horcruxes here.</p><p>The cave was impressed with powerful energy… its rocky walls possessing magical memory, the dark rituals and spells he’d performed here heavily saturating its interior. The air within the cavern was charged and pregnant with power.</p><p>Tom wouldn’t feel right doing what they intended to do anywhere else.</p><p>Tom wrapped his arms around her and turned on his heel, apparating them to the cliffs just outside the mouth of the cave.</p><p>“This is where the orphanage matron brought you as a child?” Hermione asked softly.</p><p>Tom nodded in silence as he led her into the cave.</p><p>Hermione’s breath caught as she gazed into the cavern. Tom sent a ball of light from the tip of his wand into the depths of the darkness, and it floated like a brilliant moon, its luminescence casting a glow upon the cave’s interior.</p><p>This was where Regulus Black had lost his life… where Harry and Dumbledore had fought an army of Inferi, only to find a fake locket.</p><p>Hermione gazed at the lake before her, imagining a hundred corpses lying just beneath the water’s surface. It was colorless and still, and seemed to almost be watching her. Her skin crawled with warning. She’d never felt black magic so alive before, but here it seemed to be an entity of its own, even seeming to make the darkness more dense.</p><p>To have created such an enormous amount of Inferi, one would have needed an awful lot of corpses…</p><p>Her gaze flicked to Tom to find him watching her, his black eyes contrasting sharply with his pale skin as they glinted in the silvery light.</p><p>“Come, darling,” he murmured, reaching for her hand.</p><p>He pulled her into his embrace. She realized that there was no boat as of yet, as there had been for Harry and Dumbledore. That made her feel slightly better, reminding her of the fifty years between <em> her </em> Tom and the Voldemort of her past.</p><p>Suddenly, they lifted off the ground, and she gasped as they floated into the air, moving over the silent, still waters slowly.</p><p>“Are there Inferi in this lake, Tom?” she whispered with apprehension.</p><p>“No,” he replied, and she released her breath, relief flooding her body.</p><p>There were no sounds save the occasional dripping of condensation from the stalactites on the ceiling into the water below. When they had safely crossed the water, he set her down on the island, and the little orb of light drifted closer.</p><p>She swallowed, gazing at the stone platform, upon which sat a small basin. The platform was bigger than she had thought it would be, almost like a giant stone table.</p><p>Tom withdrew his wand. “First things first,” he said with a grin. He reached out and took hold of the collar of her blouse, then jerked downward roughly, popping the pearlescent buttons to reveal her tanned skin and a lacy white bra beneath.</p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes. “You’ve been dying to do that.”</p><p>“All day,” he confirmed with a wink.</p><p>His fingertips ghosted across her skin. “Where would you like it, my dear?”</p><p>Hermione bit her lip, then pointed to her side, just below her ribcage.</p><p>“Excellent choice.” </p><p>He took her chin between his thumb and forefinger and tilted her face upward, then leaned down and claimed her lips with his.</p><p>His kiss was heady, infused with a cocktail of desire and adrenaline, before he pulled back and lifted his wand to her side.</p><p>He began to recite the incantation, and a stream of green light was emitted from his wand, creating a sort of magical pen.</p><p>The spell hit her skin with a burst of light and sparks, and she gasped as smoke curled up into the air, a veridian glow twisting along her side and upward, over her ribs.</p><p>Tom’s lips slowly curved into a grin, the twists and turns of the mark reflecting in his stygian eyes.</p><p>When he finished and the mark was complete, he lowered his wand, disconnecting from the beam of light, and smoke simmered in the air as he lit the tip of his wand, aiming it at her side.</p><p>There, etched into her skin in red ink was a long serpent, which curled from her hip and up along her side to the bottom of her ribcage. </p><p>Tom reached out and ran his fingertips along the snake’s body where it trailed up her side, grinning from ear to ear. </p><p>“Are you happy now that you’ve branded me? Hermione asked snidely.</p><p>“It’s a start,” he replied, fighting a smile. He leaned in, jerking her closer with his long fingers wrapped around her arm. “But I won’t be fully satisfied until you’re my wife, and the bond between us is finally complete, and my baby is growing in your belly.”</p><p>Hermione’s eyes widened, and her mouth fell agape. “I thought you were embarrassed by the <em> very thought </em> of it.”</p><p>He tossed her a wink and smirked as he began to unbutton his shirt. “I’ve had time to think about it.”</p><p>“<em> Lovely </em>,” she sighed in exasperation.</p><p>“Where will you brand me, Mrs. Riddle?”</p><p>She circled him, tapping her wand into her palm. “I’m not Mrs. Riddle yet.”</p><p>“Oh, but you <em> are </em>,” he muttered warmly, his voice alluring as he shrugged out of his shirt. “Just not on paper.”</p><p>Hermione was thankful for the darkness, because her cheeks blazed with heat. She cleared her throat as she stared at his muscular back, its dips and swells rippling with every slight movement beneath the glow of the pale orb. She tapped her wand to his back.</p><p>“Here,” she said decisively.</p><p>“Do you remember the spell?” he asked, turning his head slightly.</p><p>“I think so,” she murmured. “I suppose we will put your teaching skills to the test.”</p><p>“I taught you to break a full body bind, did I not? It seems that knowledge came in handy.”</p><p>“True,” she relented with a small smile. “You are a good teacher, Tom.”</p><p>“Considering that your favorite teacher was McGonnagal, a witch who only exceeded expectations in her NEWTS, I will respectfully decline from taking that as a compliment.”</p><p>“You’re an arrogant sod, sir, and I hope this hurts,” she answered, lips twitching.</p><p>She lifted her wand and recited the incantation.</p><p>His muscles tensed as the beam of light singed his pale skin. Hermione was no artist, but she found that her wand followed along with the mental image her mind had crafted, branding his flesh with magical ink.</p><p>His mark took much longer, but he made no sound, giving no indication that he felt anything aside from the tensing and twitching of his muscles as the magic danced along his skin, leaving clouds of smoke in its wake.</p><p>Minutes went by as she slowly perfected her art. </p><p>At last, she paused, then lowered her wand, and stepped back.</p><p>Her lips spread into a wide smile. “It’s perfect.”</p><p>She reached for the beaded bag around her wrist, engorging it and pointing her wand to summon a mirror. His head turned slightly, his curiosity peaking. </p><p>“What are you doing, little witch?”</p><p>She moved forward and placed her silver handheld mirror in his hand. </p><p>Then, she turned him, so that his back faced the murky water.</p><p>His eyebrows rose as he lifted the mirror, gazing at his reflection.</p><p>“It seems you’ve outdone me,” he murmured with a smirk. “I’m impressed.”</p><p>Spanning the entire width and length of his back, etched in red ink, was a fiery Phoenix. Its wings were spread and rose up over his shoulders, their flaming feathers curving toward his collarbone. </p><p>“There’s no escaping me now, Tom Riddle,” she whispered as she dragged a nail down his back, causing him to shiver. His eyes sparked with heat as they met hers in the mirror. </p><p>“Keep talking to me like that, Mrs. Riddle, and I’m going to fuck you right here, on this stone slab.”</p><p>“Don’t threaten me with a good time.”</p><p>Tom smirked and his eyes narrowed as he lowered the mirror. “Come,” he said, taking her hand in his. “We have a daunting task ahead of us.”</p><p>That caused Hermione to sober quickly. Fear crept up her spine, because she’d nearly forgotten their purpose in coming to this cave in the first place.</p><p>Tom led her to the stone and withdrew his wand, which he first used to mend her blouse, and then he produced a magical instrument, which Hermione recognized as a sextant, one similar to the kind she’d seen in Dumbledore’s office.</p><p>She watched as Tom began to chant in a strange tongue, one resembling Ancient Greek, and he began by carving a large circle into the stone beside the basin with his wand. It glowed with an eerie green effervescence, and then he began to use the sextant to make strange markings along the outside of the circle, and finally, he began to divide the circle into sections. </p><p>She admired his shirtless body as he worked, but what she found even sexier was the advanced knowledge of magical mathematics that he displayed, far beyond the level they had learned in her Introduction to Sacred Geometry class in fifth year.</p><p>“They have to be perfect, geometrically proportionate in every way,” he muttered as he measured, making marks as he went. </p><p>Hermione watched in awe of his attention to detail and dedication. If there was one thing Tom Marvolo Riddle was serious about, it was magic… and her as well, apparently.</p><p>That thought made her chest warm as she watched him.</p><p>Perhaps a half hour went by as he measured painstakingly, creating a complex maze of lines and intersections, and by the time he was finished, he had created a mosaic of light, though it had a sinister appearance, for all its beauty.</p><p>Then, he turned to Hermione.</p><p>“Do you have them?”</p><p>Hermione reached into her beaded bag and summoned two rings.</p><p>One was her engagement ring.</p><p>The other was Tom’s wedding ring, which had been custom made for her by Torpin, the goblin liason who had helped her build Midas Bank. He had written her a deeply apologetic letter, begging forgiveness on behalf of his race for their wrongs against her, and though she never held him even remotely responsible, he entreated Hermione to let him grant her a favor, as was customary for goblins when one is indebted to another.</p><p>Hermione acquiesced to his request, and asked if she might have a ring forged by goblin blacksmiths and made of the rarest dragon ore. </p><p>Hermione turned the black ring over in her hand. As the light hit it, it shone green, then red, its iridescent metal comprised of a trio of radiant colors.</p><p>Tom took her engagement ring and slipped it into his pocket. “For safekeeping. You’ll go first, then I’ll go after.”</p><p>Hermione swallowed, then nodded. </p><p>He turned to the mosaic circle, and finished it off by etching a sphere onto its center, the very zenith and pinnacle of his masterpiece.</p><p>She flicked her eyes to him. “What is this, Tom?” she asked, gesturing to the mosaic.</p><p>He pressed his tongue against his cheek as he gazed at his work. “It represents the seven lamps of the magical core. It is an ancient pictograph of the anatomy of our aureatic center… sort of like the anatomy of the brain.”</p><p>Hermione’s eyes widened. “Fascinating.”</p><p>Tom took his ring, and placed it in the center of her palm. “This requires blood, Hermione.”</p><p>Her lips parted. She blinked several times, and then nodded. </p><p>Tom conjured a knife, and laid its edge against her palm, and then closed her hand around the blade and the ring.</p><p>
<em> Trust me. </em>
</p><p>He pulled the knife through roughly, slicing her palm open.</p><p>She inhaled sharply at the dull pain of the cut. He squeezed her hand tightly around the ring as drops of her blood fell onto the rocky floor.</p><p>Then, he let go, peeling her fingers back, and she saw that her ring was coated in blood, its dark, sanguinary hue marring the lovely green emerald.</p><p>Tom took a deep breath, then exhaled. “Fuck,” he breathed.</p><p>Her eyebrows rose. “What is it?”</p><p>His eyes flicked to hers, and he ran his tongue over his teeth, deep in thought.</p><p>Suddenly, he was hesitant, and Hermione couldn’t decipher why.</p><p>At length, he spoke.</p><p>“I… this part of the ritual is difficult… it’s dark, Hermione.”</p><p>Her brows knit. “What do you need me to do?”</p><p>He swallowed, then sighed heavily, his eyes fixed on her face. “When you… when you kill someone, it creates a fracture in your soul. Like a laceration. In order to split your soul, you have to be in your most vulnerable state, so that you can deepen the fracture and extract that part of you. You’re essentially creating a break through the murder, which you can then use to tear your own soul apart.”</p><p>He must have seen the fear in her eyes. She knew that she could not hide it. “How do you do it, then?” she asked, in the tiniest whisper.</p><p>He watched her for a moment, then he replied, “You have to bring yourself to the point of death.”</p><p>Hermione’s mouth dropped open, and for the first time in her life, she was utterly speechless.</p><p>He observed her carefully, staying silent as he allowed her to process his statement.</p><p>After a moment, she asked, “How did you do that?”</p><p>His eyes flicked to the basin. “I always… drowned myself.”</p><p>Her eyebrows rose. “Oh,” she murmured shakily.</p><p>“You don’t have to do this, Hermione. I will still hold up my end of the bargain, if you change your mind.”</p><p>Hermione stood staring at the basin, blinking.</p><p>“If you decide against it, I will find another way. It has to be your choice. It won’t affect our relationship… I swear it.”</p><p>Her lips parted. “Another way to what?”</p><p>Tom’s adam’s apple bobbed as he swallowed. “To keep you alive.”</p><p>Her eyebrows knitted in confusion. “That’s what this is about? You don’t want me to die?”</p><p>His eyes met hers. “Not if I can’t go with you.”</p><p>Hermione’s eyebrows rose sharply. “I… I didn’t realize that’s what you were worried about, Tom.”</p><p>Tom was silent, waiting.</p><p>Hermione gazed at the basin of eerily still water, then at the glowing red circle with its seven triangles, its mosaic of centers, and the sphere in its middle.</p><p>Hermione knew that this wasn’t who she was.</p><p>But at the same time, Tom was half of her soul…</p><p>And she knew with deadly certainty as she looked into his eyes, that she would follow him anywhere, whether it be heaven, or hell.</p><p>She took a deep breath, and in that moment, she vowed with almost religious consecration, that she would find a way to make him whole again, even if it took her an eternity.</p><p>Until then… she knew that she would always choose to be damned with him.</p><p>They were one, after all. One soul, one spirit.</p><p>Soulmates.</p><p>She realized that she might be making a mistake, but of all the reasons she could think of to make a mistake… wasn’t love one of the noblest?</p><p>She heard Madame Violette’s words echoing in her mind.</p><p>
<em> Judgement.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> This card symbolizes the end of a period of time in your life, and the beginning of a dynamic new era, often characterized by re-evaluating our beliefs, ourselves, our morals.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Essentially, a complete metamorphosis into our higher self. </em>
</p><p>She peered up at Tom, and his eyes weren’t scarlet, but they were black, two cosmic voids that she could find herself lost in forever.</p><p>He reached out, brushing his thumb against her cheek softly as his fingertips dragged down her throat, eventually coming to rest over her heart. “Do you trust me?”</p><p>Her lips parted. “Yes,” she whispered.</p><p>He gave a wry smile, then he slid his hand around the back of her neck, guiding her downward, toward the water. </p><p>“Don’t breathe in the water, whatever you do, love,” he instructed. </p><p>He laid his hand over hers, and dragged it close to the sphere at the center of the circle. Then he held her hand suspended over it. </p><p>“At the moment when you feel your vision blackening, drop the ring into the circle. Then you can come up for air. I’ll be right here. I won’t let you drown.”</p><p>She swallowed, then nodded nervously.</p><p>“Think of Kogrod, Hermione. Think of the moment the curse hit his heart. That will sharpen the effectiveness of the ritual.”</p><p>Her chest heaved. “Okay,” she answered, her mouth dry, heart pounding.</p><p>“Are you ready?”</p><p>Her heart pounded against her ribcage so violently, she thought it might jump out of her chest.</p><p>She gave a sharp nod, and suddenly, his hand was on the back of her head, shoving her head down.</p><p>She heard a loud whooshing all around her ears as she submerged beneath the water’s surface. </p><p>Instead of ringing silence, she heard her own heartbeat in her ears, then, a strange, far off sound, like a song.</p><p>Chanting, in some ancient, unholy language, its cadence like the beating chambers of a human heart. The sound was strangely loud and silent, like the depths of the ocean, a timbre both earthy and ethereal all at once.</p><p>Air.</p><p>She needed air.</p><p>Her body acted on its own, resisting, straining, fighting for life. Her arms jerked, but he held her hand in place. Her free hand pushed against the stone surface, trying to gain leverage. </p><p>Tom held her there, his hand an ever-grounding presence upon her head, both firm and gentle, keeping her in place although her mind screamed with desperation.</p><p>Not only could she feel him there physically, but she spiritually felt him, and somehow sensed that he could feel her distress, her fear, her alarm through the strange bond between their souls.</p><p>She sobbed into the blackness of the water, and the water swallowed her sobs, unforgiving and sovereign. The urge to breathe was strong, the desire, overwhelming, to open her mouth and inhale, to suck in any form of oxygen, even that which made up the water itself. </p><p>Her lungs ached, throbbing in her chest like she was lying beneath a heavy iron weight. Hermione saw red, and the seconds passed by painfully, seeming to never end…</p><p>She bucked against his hold, but he was merciless, unrelenting…</p><p>
<em> What had he said? </em>
</p><p>She could hardly think.</p><p>All that she could think about, suddenly, was that after everything she had been through in her life, all of her decisions had led her to this moment where her enemy and tormenter now held her underwater, watching the life drain out of her.</p><p>She had placed her very life in the hands of someone she had always known to be evil, and at that moment, she saw herself go up in flames, her past life, nothing but a pit of ashes.</p><p>
<em> You will be reborn out of the ashes of such a love… </em>
</p><p>Suddenly, darkness began to roll like smoke across her vision, like black clouds raining tiny drops of shadow upon her consciousness, sweeping her into a place of peace, of nonexistence, of nothingness.</p><p>She was so tempted to let it take her away, to be sucked into that void of emptiness. She felt so cold, so vacant of pain, but she heard Tom’s voice in her mind.</p><p>
<em> Drop the ring, little witch. </em>
</p><p>Her eyes sprung wide open, and she felt him guiding her hand as she slammed the ring down upon the stone table.</p><p>At that moment, Tom yanked her roughly by her hair, jerking her out of the water swiftly.</p><p>But Hermione disappeared into the ether.</p><p>She screamed, but it sounded far-away, echoing distantly in her subconscious, almost resounding like someone else entirely. She felt a soul-rending pain, as if someone had cut open her chest and rent her emotions in half. It felt like a second death being forced upon her, followed by a second birth.</p><p>A sob built at the base of her throat, but she made no other sound, unable to release the soul-rending pain she was experiencing.</p><p>Something began to leave her body, rising into her throat like a scream, and it escaped through her mouth. </p><p>Then, Hermione was still, so still… and so cold.</p><p>——————-</p><p>Tom held Hermione as she crumpled into his arms like a rag doll, succumbing to the power of the ritual which put her into a trancelike state, the magic working its potency upon her soul. </p><p>Her skin was cold, like a plane of ice. She coughed, heaving up water, but he could sense that her mind was elsewhere, absorbed into the shadowy darkness that Tom knew so well.</p><p>Nobody had been there with him the first time he had performed this ritual. Tom had been fairly certain that he would die in the process.</p><p>Being a pioneer in the realm of magic meant performing ancient spells that few had ever attempted, and with that, there was always a chance of death, of making a fatal error.</p><p>He remembered the first time he’d attempted to make a horcrux. He’d had to perform the act of drowning himself three times before he succeeded at last.</p><p>Tom had failed in his first two attempts due to imperfect timing. The instructions he was following were written in an archaic form of Greek, and he’d struggled with translating its nuances. For that reason, he had been forced to perform the ritual thrice, relying on trial and error to be his teacher. </p><p>The final time that he held his head in the water, he’d almost given up.</p><p>Even one as dedicated as Tom would be disheartened to have to bring oneself to the point of death on three separate occasions.</p><p>Luckily, his third time was a charm.</p><p>He gazed down at the witch in his arms, stroking her face softly, brushing the wet curls from her cheeks. </p><p>His heart pounded like a ceremonial drum, fear coursing through his veins as he felt for her pulse. </p><p>It thumped rapidly against his fingers. </p><p>He never actually knew how long he’d been in this state when he created his horcruxes… he’d only awoken with no knowledge of how much time had passed.</p><p>Because he was always alone… but he realized suddenly, that he was no longer alone, and that was a strange feeling for Tom, having been alone for his entire human existence.</p><p>Suddenly he heard a thin ringing sound, and his head snapped up to catch a movement beside the basin.</p><p>Tom’s ring had begun to spin on the slab where Hermione had dropped it.</p><p>Tom’s lips parted, brows furrowing.</p><p>He turned back to see Hermione begin to stir.</p><p>She coughed, spitting up more water, then lifted a hand to her head, pressing her wrist to her forehead as if it pained her.</p><p>Then, she blinked, and opened her eyes. </p><p>Tom stared into the eyes of a witch who was brave, one who was his equal, one he deemed worthy to walk by his side. </p><p>He found that he was enchanted, bewitched, and absolutely <em> mesmerized </em> by her, mind, body, and soul.</p><p>She gazed back at him, eyebrows raised in disbelief. “Did… did I do it?”</p><p>Tom laughed. He couldn’t help himself.</p><p>“I do believe you did, little witch.”</p><p>Her eyes were laughing as well, those magnetic, whiskey brown eyes that were now streaked with tiny bolts of crimson.</p><p>She reached up and grabbed him by the back of his neck and drew him down for a kiss. </p><p>Tom let his fear dissolve as he kissed her, pride stirring in his chest, hunger and possessiveness tightening his muscles.</p><p>He broke the kiss to mutter softly, “You’re mine, forever, Hermione Granger. I shall never take the ring off.”</p><p>She smiled, then held up her hand, where she held her emerald engagement ring, the pale gold serpent circling the stone as it ate its own tail… the ouroboros. “Now you have to become mine… it’s your turn, darling.”</p>

</p><p> </p><p><br/>
School was let out for the holidays, so the Hogwarts dungeons were empty. </p><p>Some common rooms might have still contained a few students who stayed over the holidays, but none belonged to Slytherin house, of course. They all had families, whose blood was pure and noble.  No reason to stay behind.</p><p>Tom had been the only Slytherin student who ever stayed over Christmas, though in his later years, he was invited to Malfoy Manor for the holidays. </p><p>He only went once, because he couldn’t stand the icy looks given to him by Abraxas’ mother. It reminded him of that which he could not change: his muggle blood.</p><p>Hermione could not change hers either, nor did she want to. That thought pricked him often, reminding him of how bigoted and narrow minded his views had been before she landed in his life.</p><p><em> You never believed it, </em> he told himself. <em> You only wielded those beliefs for the sake of power. </em></p><p>It didn’t make him feel any better about it… because he had, in fact, believed it.</p><p>For a time.</p><p>And because he had believed it, those icy looks irked him, the judgement in the eyes of the elder members of his followers’ families who didn’t want their heirs tainted by the influence of a half-blood. </p><p>Tom had wanted nothing better than to bring the entire pureblooded set to their knees before him, to see the defeat in their eyes when they realized that yes, both politically and magically, they had been bested by someone of inferior birth.</p><p>Tom stood in his old Slytherin dorm room, gazing into a makeshift mirror which he’d transfigured out of a green tie he found under his old bed.</p><p>He wondered which poor sod slept in it now.</p><p>He was offhandedly thinking of all the ways he might destroy Malfoy’s life as he adjusted his bowtie. It was his favorite pastime of late.</p><p>Rosier and Rowle were behind him, getting dressed as well. They were uncomfortable in their muggle suits… scratching at the collars, brushing off lint, exchanging glances every so often.</p><p>Tom’s lips twitched.</p><p>Today was Hermione’s day, but it was also Tom’s day, because he was getting what he’d wanted, what he’d sworn to himself that he would do nearly a year ago.</p><p>He was marrying Hermione Dumbledore.</p><p>…Granger? </p><p>The names were interchangeable in his mind now. </p><p>He’d given her the option of using the name Dumbledore as well, but she’d chosen Riddle.</p><p>“Granger is who I used to be,” she’d said. “Dumbledore is who I am now. But Riddle…” She smiled up at Tom, wrapping her arms around his neck. “Riddle is my future.”</p><p>Tom had once sworn that he would shed that name forever. </p><p>Now, leaving it behind would be impossible.</p><p>Wouldn’t it? It was a small price to pay to get what he wanted. Perhaps, with his extreme shift in plans, a muggle surname would serve him better.</p><p>Hermione had chosen to embrace her muggle heritage as she made wedding plans, though to outsiders, it merely seemed as if she were making a statement by mixing muggle wedding traditions with wizarding ones. </p><p>She was an activist, after all, and she said it would help with Tom’s reputation for the public to see him participate.</p><p>The public still questioned their engagement.</p><p>Tom stared into the mirror as he pinned in his cufflinks.</p><p>His skin was slightly more waxy than it had been before the cave, features sharper, his cheeks a bit more gaunt, eyes more hollow.</p><p>His irises were more permanently marbled with red.</p><p>A slight shift that was barely noticeable, but Hermione had noticed it.</p><p>She noticed everything about Tom, even his preoccupation of late.</p><p>Tom couldn’t help it. His compulsive nature was begging to be satisfied, the need for revenge driving him to madness.</p><p>He’d let them go. Malfoy. <em>Walburga</em>.</p><p>Even the rest of his death eaters had known what they were planning.</p><p>Nott. Mulciber. Rookwood. Avery. Lestrange.</p><p>Tom’s eyes narrowed in the mirror. He said their names over and over again, reminding himself, tallying, plotting.</p><p>Stewing in an all-consuming rage that had yet to dissipate.</p><p>In the year after he’d graduated from Hogwarts, he’d gone out to an open field to practice casting Fiendfyre.</p><p>He wanted to control it, to learn to wield the temperamental curse.</p><p>His rage reminded him of those flames, and he wanted to let his former death eaters be swallowed up in it. They could not be allowed to bear his mark and still live… but he would be forced to bide his time.</p><p>He’d given Hermione his word that he would not kill them, since for some <em>infuriating</em> reason, she thought it was necessary that their offspring should be born.</p><p>But once those children were born…</p><p>Tom imagined himself casting that curse, the flames starting as tiny circles that would grow into rabid animals. His were serpents, tiny ones that morphed into dragons the size of skyscrapers.</p><p>He imagined those flames swallowing Malfoy Manor whole.</p><p>When he’d practiced it, the curse had many times grown out of control, to the point where Tom finally became familiar with its nature, its nuances. Muggle newspapers had reported the instances as wildfires that had spun out of control. The ministry investigated, but could never find the culprit responsible.</p><p>As a result, Tom had mastered the curse.</p><p>A few muggles had perished, but all in the name of magic, so it was well justified in Tom’s mind.</p><p>Magic was all that ever mattered…</p><p>… and Hermione.</p><p>Especially <em> Hermione</em>.</p><p>Hermione reigned supreme in Tom’s mind, and he realized that from this day forward he would have to be more careful with his actions. He would have to justify them. His indiscretions needed to have meaning, <em> purpose</em>.</p><p>That was just as well. He’d learned many things from Hermione, one being that the road to power had many routes.</p><p>He could just as easily build an army of muggleborns as he could an army of purebloods.</p><p>Perhaps they’d be more trustworthy, more pliable.</p><p>Tom was part muggle, after all. Perhaps they needed a champion.</p><p>He certainly couldn’t trust Malfoy and his ilk, not after what he’d done. But could he have ever <em>really</em> trusted them? When they let him spend fourteen years wandering the earth as a wraith, making no attempt to bring him back in bodily form?</p><p>Oh, yes, Tom had given a great deal of thought to the events of the future. He had fanatically analyzed every detail, every mistake he had made with great diligence.</p><p>He had failed to secure Britain, not once, but <em>twice</em>.</p><p>It unnerved Tom, made him question himself, and he was not used to feeling that way.</p><p>Rowle looked over Tom’s shoulder into the mirror, then took a deep breath.</p><p>He looked like a hulking bull forced into a suit.</p><p>Tom’s lips twitched again. </p><p>He was, in part, testing their loyalty. </p><p>He was certainly pushing the limits of their trust and obedience by forcing them to wear muggle suits in front of all of London, particularly their own families. </p><p>Their families wouldn’t attend the wedding, of course, but the photographs would be in all the papers.</p><p>They knew Tom was doing it on purpose, so they hadn’t uttered a single complaint. </p><p>Rosier had it out with his father, insisting that he must be in the wedding, even though he’d promised his father to steer clear of Tom.</p><p>Just this once, for old time’s sake, he’d said. He couldn’t very well say no to his old school friend, although his father would certainly raise an eyebrow to see that the rest of his school friends were not only absent from the wedding party, but the wedding itself.</p><p>Once Rosier turned twenty-one, his fortune would be released. He had a vault with his name on it, reserved for his marriageable age.</p><p>“I can’t, Riddle,” huffed Rowle. “I can’t  figure out this bloody dog collar.”</p><p>He struggled with his bowtie, so Tom turned to help him, a repressed smile playing on his lips.</p><p>”Muggles,” Rowle muttered under his breath, wrinkling his nose in distaste.</p><p>They owed him this. They could’ve warned him about Malfoy’s waywardness, but they chose to remain silent.</p><p>They had believed in their friends too much. It would be a long time before he trusted them even a measure.</p><p>He never trusted anyone fully. </p><p>Excepting, of course, his wife-to-be.</p><p>Tom looked at them both. “Do not make me regret this,” he said sharply. “If I have you in my wedding, and you go on to cross me… they’ll never find your bones, because your bodies will be rotting in the depths of the ocean.”</p><p>”Wouldn’t dream of it,” Rosier said with a sarcastic leer on his face, his cheeriness contrasting sharply with Tom’s severity.</p><p>Rosier was still drunk, after all, from their night out at the giant’s pub.</p><p>Tom reached into his tux to pull out his wand. Their eyes shone with fear for a moment, but Tom merely cast a sobering charm upon his groomsmen, then promptly turned and left the dungeons, leaving their hearts stammering in his wake.</p><p> </p><p>**********</p><p> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Hermione stared into the floor length mirror, her bridesmaids looking on with wet eyes.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She took in her appearance, her gown, the carefully spelled and subdued curls of her hair, which hadn’t yet been wound up into their intended design.<br/>
<br/>
No one close to Hermione had noticed it, but she had, and she suspected Dumbledore had as well.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">It wasn’t that her appearance had changed overmuch. Truly, she had expected more of a transformation after creating such a dark object, but Tom had informed her that dark magic only affected one’s appearance after prolonged and consistent use.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">There was something different about her person, however. She felt it almost immediately after, and she’d assumed that it would fade, but it hadn’t. Hermione felt sharper, lighter, but also heavier in a way that was difficult to pinpoint. Her reflexes were quicker, senses more attuned to her environment, to the magic surrounding her, to the energy at the disposal of those around her. She felt a more pronounced vein in her power, something she was able to tap into more readily than before.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She felt closer to Tom. When he was near, their magic reached for one another.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">When he was away, she felt anxious, on edge. Easily frustrated. Quicker to reach for her wand.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She didn’t feel empty, or unwhole, as she thought she would. On the contrary, she felt more alert, more in tune with her power… as if she had always been somewhat predisposed to the use of dark magic.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Hermione didn’t know how she felt about it. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">No, her appearance hadn’t changed, per sè, save for the few threads of crimson weaving their way through her amber eyes.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">But she knew Albus had noticed it. The moment she had walked into his office the following Sunday, he had frozen, his entire being stilled as his eyes roved over her in tense appraisal. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">He had sensed the dark magic overshadowing her, an atmosphere of danger, the way the air crackled and hissed like a serpent preparing to strike. He had noticed it right away, as sensitive to magic as he was, as educated and experienced as he had become over the years. Their eyes had met, but he hadn’t uttered a word, which was very unlike Albus, who was always prepared to give a lecture.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">No doubt, he realized there was no correcting what had already occurred. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Even now, Hermione itched for Tom’s presence, for the ring which contained a sliver of his soul. Over the past months, she’d grown used to wearing it, to feeling its weight, its comforting magic which often cocooned her in Tom’s power like a warm blanket. It soothed her when they were forced apart by their respective careers. Now, with the rings being cared for by the wedding party in preparation for the ceremony, her hand felt bare, cold, and it agitated her. She ran her nails over the naked skin of her finger, resisting the urge to scratch, chewing the inside of her cheek in perturbation.<br/>
</span>
</p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1"><em>Soon</em>, she told herself in a self-soothing manner. <em>An hour at most, and the ring will be back on your finger.<br/>
<br/>
</em></span>
</p><p class="p1">********</p><p class="p1"><br/>
A knock sounded at the door of the Gryffindor common room. Hermione hurried back behind the changing screen, and her bridesmaids were all aflutter as Piksy ran to the door to see who it was. </p><p>“It is Mr. Riddle!” she called, eliciting a chorus of giggles, oohs, and aahs from her bridesmaids.</p><p>“You’re next,” Cedrella mouthed silently across the room to Winnie.</p><p>Winnie held in a stream of laughter with admirable effort.</p><p>“Come in!” Hermione shouted from behind the screen.</p><p>The door opened, and in walked Tom, looking dashing in an entirely black tuxedo, a brilliant crimson rose pinned to his lapel.</p><p>He bestowed a glance upon the group of bridesmaids, then bowed deferentially. “May I have a moment with my bride?”</p><p>Eulessia rubbed her lips together to keep from giggling (they were all a bit blitzed from some muggle concoction that Hermione called a mi-moh-sah), but Piksy stepped forward with both hands planted on her waist. “Master Riddle is not to see the dress before the ceremony!”</p><p>Tom’s eyes moved from the elf to where Hermione stood behind the screen, gazing at him with warmth in her amber eyes. </p><p>His lips slowly stretched into a grin. “Then take it off.”</p><p>A screeching chorus of giggles broke loose, and Hermione rolled her eyes. “If you only knew how <em> difficult </em> it was to get on.”</p><p>He chuckled, then sauntered forward. “I simply came to give you your wedding gift. From yours truly.”</p><p>Winnie and Cedrella exchanged glances, then ushered the other bridesmaids from the room as they gave the happy couple a moment.</p><p>He approached her slowly, his eyes devouring hers. Then he leaned over the top of the screen and kissed her softly as the roaring fire in the hearth crackled.</p><p>“Good morning, darling.”</p><p>Hermione’s eyes sparkled. “Good morning,” she murmured breathlessly.</p><p>Snow danced in the air through the diamond-paned windows.</p><p>“I have something for you,” he muttered against her lips. He lifted up a silver box and added, “I seem to remember you mentioning some silly rhyme, about something old and something blue, something stolen and something true…  some silly <em>muggle</em> nonsense.”</p><p>Hermione cocked a brow. “That is <em> not </em> how it goes.”</p><p>His lips twitched and he lifted the filigree box over the screen. “I think I have something old and something blue covered, in any case.”</p><p>Hermione’s eyebrows knit and she took the box, then carefully lifted the lid.</p><p>Instantly, her mouth dropped open, eyes widening. “Oh my.”</p><p>Tom’s eyes met hers.</p><p>“But… for me? Why?”</p><p>He cleared his throat. “Well, for one, it won’t ever be made into a horcrux… and secondly, you’re the most brilliant witch I know, so I feel it should belong to you. They say it has magical properties to grant the wearer wisdom, and though I consider you to be quite wise enough already, I thought it might come in handy in your new role as Minister, in moments where you find yourself at a loss.”</p><p>Hermione lifted Rowena Ravenclaw’s diadem from the box, peering at it carefully.</p><p>“I’ve never… I didn’t get a chance to really look at it before. We were all in such a hurry to destroy it.”</p><p>Tom gazed at it. It was a strange feeling, looking at the object he’d desired for so long, an object he’d spent months of his final year seeking out, befriending Helena Ravenclaw’s ghost all for the lust of it.</p><p>Seeing it consumed in Fiendfyre in Hermione’s memories had driven all its luster away.</p><p>But he’d still gone in search of it, unwilling to let such a treasure be lost in some forest in Albania. It belonged to Hermione. He’d known it from the moment he grasped it in his hands.</p><p>“I’m speechless, Tom. I didn’t expect this.” She touched the blue sapphire in its center. “But don’t you think it will be recognized if I wear it today?”</p><p>Tom rubbed his lips together, then shook his head. “I don’t think many people even remember the legend, except perhaps a few Ravenclaws. No one alive has seen it, save you and I. It would be bizarre indeed for it to turn up now, on your head. I highly doubt it would be noticed. Everyone will think you’re conspiring with Madam Malkin to start a new trend of tiara wearing.” He rolled his eyes, and that made Hermione giggle.</p><p>“It’s lovely, Tom,” she murmured softly. “I have a present for you as well.”</p><p>His eyebrows rose, and she grinned. “Hand me my beaded bag, won’t you? There, on the chest.”</p><p>Tom crossed the common room to the old chest that served as a coffee table, and took up her bag. </p><p>When he’d handed it to her over the screen, she summoned from it a sealed folder and a small velvet bag. </p><p>First, she handed him the velvet bag, her expression lit up with barely concealed excitement.</p><p>His eyes flicked up at her, and she bit her lip. </p><p>He turned up the bag and out fell a piece of jewelry into his palm.</p><p>Not just any piece of jewelry, he realized upon closer inspection…</p><p>It was a golden locket bearing a large green stone of faceted Alexandrite.</p><p>Tom’s lips parted.</p><p>This couldn’t be what he thought it was.</p><p>Through the transparency of the stone he saw a large crest embedded in its bezel.</p><p>The crest of Salazar Slytherin.</p><p>Tom blinked. His heart rate sped up.</p><p>“Hermione…” he murmured. “Is this what I think it is?”</p><p>She rubbed her lips together, then nodded. </p><p>Tom looked at her, then back down at the locket.</p><p>If he had a sickle for every time he’d questioned Mr. Borgin about this item, he would be wealthier than Malfoy.</p><p>He had, through some sleuthing, learned that Borgin had acquired it from a desperate witch, who had turned out to be Tom’s mother when he’d checked the shop’s backlogs.</p><p>The locket had been a relic and an heirloom passed down from Slytherin to the Peverell family, then through the Gaunts when the Peverell line diminished. </p><p>His mother had hocked it for 10 galleons.</p><p>Tom swallowed thickly, his mouth suddenly dry. “Where did you get this?”</p><p>“Well,” she began hesitantly. “It was bought by a witch named Hepzibah Smith. She collects such items, and I traded her for it.”</p><p>He cocked a brow. “What did you give her?”</p><p>Hermione held her breath. “I- I might have given her the sword of Gryffindor. She drives a hard bargain.”</p><p>Tom’s eyes widened. “You did what?”</p><p>“She wouldn’t give it to me unless I had something from Ravenclaw or Gryffindor.”</p><p>“Are you bloody out of your mind, Hermione? You could’ve just-“</p><p>He paused.</p><p>Hermione gave him a scathing look. “I could’ve what? Killed her?”</p><p>“I was not going to say that.”</p><p>“You thought it.”</p><p>“I didn’t. I was going to say, you could’ve obliviated her and traded her something else from her collection. She would’ve been none the wiser.”</p><p>“<em>You </em> didn’t do that, when you took it.”</p><p>He took a deep breath. “Fair enough.”</p><p>He stared down at the locket, blinking.</p><p>“The thing about the sword is,” she continued. “It doesn’t like to stay put. It tends to… disappear. It will turn back up eventually. It always does… for a true Gryffindor, that is, which she is most definitely <em> not</em>.”</p><p>Tom smirked. “You sneaky witch. You pulled a fast one on that old woman.”</p><p>Hermione’s mouth dropped open. “I beg your finest pardon? It’s better than killing her?l”</p><p>“Oh, you’re right,” he said mockingly. “Of course. You’re better than me… by a very, <em> very </em> small margin.”</p><p>Hermione cocked her jaw to the side. “You made me this way, you know.”</p><p>“And I love it, mind you. I absolutely do.”</p><p>He pressed his tongue against his cheek as he touched the locket gingerly with his fingertips. “Thank you, little witch. I’m… at a loss for words. I’ve wanted this.”</p><p>Hermione grimaced. “That’s not all.”</p><p>Tom lifted an eyebrow. “Come again?”</p><p>She lifted the folder over the screen. “There’s also this… I hope it doesn’t have the wrong effect and ruin your day.”</p><p>“I don’t believe there’s a damn thing you could do to ruin my day today.” His eyes narrowed as he took the folder. “What is it?”</p><p>“Just open it.”</p><p>Tom flipped open the folder. Then he froze.</p><p>His eyes slid across the first few lines of the paperwork.</p><p>“Primary benefactor of… Wool’s Orphanage?” He mumbled, aghast.</p><p>Hermione chewed her bottom lip, apprehension painting her features. “Please forgive me if I’ve overstepped.”</p><p>His eyebrows drew forward as he skimmed the paperwork, flipping the pages. “You’ve donated to this orphanage? <em> My </em> orphanage?”</p><p>She gave him a wry smile, then spilled a stream of apologies. “I’m sorry. I just- I went there and it seemed so <em> horrid </em> and all I could see was you and your childhood and I felt sick and the beds in that place were made exactly how you make yours and they were all in one room! Simply <em> awful </em>, and then you talked about a benefactor that you’d killed and I was afraid it was that particular orphanage, and-“</p><p>“Hermione, hush, darling,” he interrupted, reaching out to grip her around the back of the neck and pulled her forward, planting a kiss on the top of her head. “I assure you, I am not upset. Just a bit shocked, and confused.”</p><p>She swallowed, then closed her eyes beneath the comfort of his touch. “I just needed to do something… something to fix what you went through… what you didn’t get to experience… at least, for the other children.”</p><p>He blinked, staring at the wall as he rested his chin on the top of her head. “I understand. I appreciate the sentiment. Truly, I do.”</p><p>“I wanted…” She choked, tears brimming in her eyes, and she internally thanked the gods for magical mascara that didn’t smear. “I want to create a magical orphanage, one for muggleborns and half-bloods who’ve lost their parents. It’s a complete embarrassment that there isn’t one already. No children should be placed in an establishment like that, but especially not <em> magical </em> children! So many things can go wrong.”</p><p>“I agree. It is a noble dream, Hermione.” Tom leaned back and she pulled away, wiping at the tears staining her cheeks. He blinked, then leaned forward and wiped away the remaining tears with his thumb before murmuring in her ear, “I shall help you accomplish such a thing, if your heart desires it.”</p><p>“It just weighs on me, knowing what you went through. You should never have been there.” She paused, then lowered her head and whispered, “Dumbledore should’ve got you out. He should’ve gotten Harry out.”</p><p>Tom leaned forward suddenly, taking her face in both hands and pressed his lips to hers.</p><p>She hadn’t a care in the world for her lipstick. She parted her lips, permitting him to slide his tongue against hers. His mouth was hungrier of late, more brutal, simply devastating, laying waste to any shred of reservation she had left.</p><p>She let out a soft moan and he tightened his grip on her curls. When he broke away with much difficulty, he muttered, “Tonight. You’ll be mine.”</p><p>Tom and Hermione had reached an agreement. </p><p>After the night in the cave, he had informed her that he wanted to stop having sex until the wedding. </p><p>That had shocked Hermione, almost angering her.</p><p>“How dare you decide that on your own, without consulting me?” Her eyes had snapped with indignation.</p><p>“You don’t think you’re being a bit dramatic?” He’d asked calmly. “We have our entire lives and you’re worrying about a few months?”</p><p>“Yes, and you, sir, are Mr. Murder and yet you’re advocating for abstinence like a priest? I think we are a bit beyond that? Don’t you think?”</p><p>Tom Riddle gazed at his feisty fiancée incredulously. “Yes. True. But don’t you think it could be… fun?”</p><p>“That sounds entirely like the opposite of fun.”</p><p>Tom sighed. “One month. Just one. The month before the wedding.”</p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes. “Fine,” she huffed. “I never thought I’d see the day when the wizard who once told me he wanted his cum in my stomach would decide to turn it off like a spicket.”</p><p>Tom had burst out laughing, genuinely and wholeheartedly amused.</p><p>During that miserable month, he’d severely regretted his decision many times.</p><p>Even now, he had half a mind to rip off her one-of-a-kind gown and have her on the Gryffindor study table.</p><p>… or Dumbledore’s desk.</p><p><em> That </em> was an idea.</p><p>Hermione smiled at him. “Tonight, Tom Riddle.”</p><p>His eyes narrowed, and he reached over, collecting the diadem and placed it in her head. “I’ll see you in the Great Hall. Last chance to change your mind, Dumbledore.”</p><p>She chuckled and lifted a brow. “What if I do change my mind?”</p><p>“Then I shall imperius you. We’ll be so happy together.” He gave her a sinister smile, and she could almost see his boyish self peeking through. </p><p>Hermione laughed and watched him go, her heart in her throat, a tingling sensation in her limbs.</p><p> </p><p>*********</p><p> </p><p>The Great Hall had never been so full of people, not even when Hogwarts hosted the tri-wizard tournament. Nearly six hundred witches and wizards had gathered to see the premier magical wedding of the year. </p><p>Some of the seats had been sectioned off for family and friends, though other areas were reserved for the press, for ministry officials, for special guests. </p><p>Tom stood at the front of the room, gazing out at the crowd. There were famous quidditch players in attendance, renowned authors and alchemists, magical historians and inventors, no doubt many who were close family friends of the Dumbledore family. He didn’t recognize many of the faces, but he’d skimmed the guest list, noting attendees such as Sylvestra Stormbrook, the well-known inventor of a line of enchanted automobiles (Stormbrook Studebakers), the famous seeker of the Holyhead Harpies, Newt Scamander, Nicholas Flamel, Supreme Mugwump Santos, and many well-known muggle activists. </p><p>He was surprised to see many of the students he went to school with, quite a fair few Slytherins, some from his class and others either a few years older or younger. His Slytherin head of house, Professor Slughorn, sat near the front, beaming from ear to ear. Tom’s lips twitched as he fought a smile. Behind Slughorn, sat Mr. Borgin and Caractarus Burke, both looking quite unhappy and incredibly out of place in the cheery hall.</p><p>Tom supposed they were, now that they’d lost their lead salesman to the DADA post.</p><p>He knew from scanning the guest list that week that even some of the Boot Family had traveled from the Americas to attend the wedding. They were his last living relatives, distant as though they were.</p><p>There were several individuals who were not in attendance. They had not been invited, of course, but neither had they requested to come.</p><p>The Malfoys. The Blacks. The rest of his former death eaters.</p><p>He pushed it from his mind. He didn’t want to feel rage today.</p><p>Aberforth sat on the front row, next to Winifred’s brother and the Potters.</p><p>A popular wizarding jazz band, the Swedish Seers, played a soft, melodic tune in the background, and Tom turned to find Minister Moon approaching the platform.</p><p>Moon held out his hand to Tom. “Congratulations, Tom Riddle,” he said softly, slapping Tom on the back. “Today is the big day! How do you feel, my boy?”</p><p>“I feel incredibly lucky, sir.”</p><p>Minister Moon chuckled softly. “I’d say you aren’t the type of wizard who needs luck, but when it comes to Miss Dumbledore, I’d say you <em> must </em> have had a bit of luck, eh?”</p><p>“Either that,” Riddle murmured with a smile, “or it was simply fate.”</p><p>“That it is, that it is! I’m happy for you both. A <em>formidable</em> couple! We are all expecting great things. Shall I refresh your memory for the vows?”</p><p>“No, sir. I recall everything.”</p><p>“Good, good. Any minute now.”</p><p>The Great Hall was a winter wonderland. The enchanted ceiling mirrored the sky outside the castle, raining snow which disappeared before it touched the wedding guests. The hall was decked out in crimson and emerald decorations, not only because it was Yule, but to represent the merging of Tom and Hermione’s Hogwarts houses, as was tradition with most British wizarding weddings. Holly leaves trimmed the aisles, and a massive, glittering evergreen tree stood in the corner, draped in tinsel, mesmerizing the guests as it twinkled and turned.</p><p>The mood this Christmas morning was light and airy, spirits high as the sunlight filtered through the long windows of the Great Hall.</p><p>This was a very different Christmas for Tom.</p><p>Most years he’d spent Christmas alone; there was rarely anything special about the day, as he’d never had anyone to share it with. Most of his years at school, he’d spent his Christmases by the hearth in the Slytherin common room, studying.</p><p>Tom swallowed. He wasn’t nervous, but he felt a bit of gravity settling over him, the knowledge that everything would change from this day forward. </p><p>Fate had sent Hermione Granger, a time traveler from the future, to alter his entire life.</p><p>Hermione was his missing puzzle piece. Everything about their union felt<em> so right </em> to Tom; he knew it as surely as he knew his own magic. Like the instinctual urges Tom  experienced when he dueled, he felt the same instincts guiding him to Hermione. </p><p>His eyes scanned the audience, and landed on Dufresne. He sat on the third row, accompanied by several members of the DMLE, all of whom gazed back at him stoically. Tom’s lips curved upward.</p><p>Gaspard blinked, then adjusted his tie, refusing to meet Tom’s gaze.</p><p>Tom would have reveled in the sense of triumph a moment longer, but the doors of the Great Hall opened, and a swarm of fairies flew over the crowd.</p><p>The band began to play a gentle melody, slow and hypnotic as Celestina swayed to the smooth rhythm. </p><p>Rowle entered, garbed from head to toe in the latest muggle finery with Eulessia Baron on his arm. He gave Tom a tortured look as they made their way down the aisle, followed by Rosier and Winnie, and then, lastly, Septimus and Cedrella Weasley, whom Hermione had insisted on having in the wedding. She’d voiced that she always imagined she’d marry Ron, and though she knew now that Ron wouldn’t have made her happy, the Weasleys remained to Hermione like her own family, and it was a comfort to her to know that they had taken part in her wedding.</p><p>It was hard enough not to have her family and old friends here with her, in the past. Tom acquiesced to her every request without an ounce of resistance.</p><p>He watched as Hermione came into view, clinging to Dumbledore’s arm. </p><p>Together, they carefully climbed the steps and appeared in the doorway. Albus wore a set of embroidered crimson robes and a pointed hat, the ones Hermione had gifted him last Christmas, and he looked every bit like a ginger Santa Claus. </p><p>Hermione was garbed in a voluminous, fur-trimmed cloak of silver velvet, which was stitched with elaborate, art nouveau  embroidery. Piksy and Lucky wore their own sets of fine wizarding robes, and trailed along behind her, carrying her train.</p><p>Hermione’s snow-dusted hair was curled and partly pinned back, and she’d somehow woven her veil into the diadem which sat atop her head.</p><p>Tom’s heart thudded erratically.</p><p>Murmurs rose from the crowd as Hermione walked through the doorway. Several of the fairies fluttered around Hermione, gingerly removing her cloak. The moment the robes fell away, a collective gasp could be heard throughout the hall.</p><p>Hermione’s bridal gown clung to her body, glistening like snow in the morning sun. It was a web of glittering jewels, whose enchanted facets sparkled as the light hit them, giving the illusion of a coating of ice over her body. The see-through mesh boasted a sweetheart neckline edged with diamonds, a collar of more gems that criss crossed across her collarbone, with dripping pearls that dangled like icicles into the valley between her breasts. Sheer chiffon sleeves wrapped around her upper arms and flowed to the ground behind her.</p><p>The crowd watched her in stunned silence as Celestina Warbeck began to croon a dreamy torch song, piano keys tinkling softly in the background.</p><p>Tom’s eyes came to rest upon her, lips parted, eyebrows lifting in shock at the celestial vision. </p><p>Once the initial surprise faded, his lips spread into a slow, wide grin.</p><p>Snow sprites flapped their iridescent wings, sprinkling enchanted pixie dust over the wedding guests as Hermione made her way down the aisle on Dumbledore’s arm. The dust had a euphoric effect, able to impart joy and lightheartedness, and the crowd seemed to lift even more into a realm of immense happiness beneath its influence.</p><p>Rosier stood behind Tom, and reached forward to clap him on the shoulder, giving him a good shake as a soft laughter rose from the audience.</p><p>Tom’s eyes met Hermione’s. She smiled dreamily, and his gaze became like a telescope, honing in on her alone as Albus brought her forward.</p><p>As they neared the front, Hermione turned to hug Dumbledore tightly, both their eyes glistening. The Headmaster passed Hermione’s hands into Tom’s, tossing him a stern glance, to which Tom politely inclined his head, having intuited his meaning perfectly.</p><p>The look seemed to say, “Do right by her, or you and I will have that duel I promised.”</p><p>Hermione stood before Tom, their hands clasped and gazes locked.</p><p>“Welcome, citizens of Magical Britain…” began Minister Moon. </p><p>He drawled on with his introductory speech, but Tom heard not a word. All he could see was the ravishing beauty of the witch he had desired for the better part of two years, visions of the future they would craft splayed out before him.</p><p>Tom began to feel transcendent. </p><p>“Have you the rings, Edward Rosier?”</p><p>He was finally roused from his trance by Rosier, who held out the rings, which were set on an open Book of Souls, as was wizarding tradition. Tom took up Hermione’s ring, its emerald glinting with a preternatural essence, and slid it onto her slender finger.</p><p>Hermione bit her lip as she gazed at the ring that contained a piece of Tom’s soul, heart hammering out of her chest.</p><p>Tom began to recite the words that Minister Moon read out of his little black book. Hermione had opted to use the muggle vows that her parents had made during their wedding. She said it would feel as if they were there with her, somehow. </p><p>“They would have wanted me to use them,” she said sadly, wishing more than anything that Tom could’ve met them, that perhaps they could have given Tom a better perception of muggles.</p><p>Tom clearly intonated in his calm, rich timbre as he repeated the vows.</p><p>“To have and to hold from this day forward...”</p><p>“For richer, for poorer…”</p><p>“In sickness, and in health...”</p><p>“To love and to cherish...”</p><p>“Til death do us part...” </p><p>“I pledge thee my soul and my magic,” he pronounced, sealing up the vow by pushing the ring onto her finger. </p><p>Her eyes widened as she saw the ring on her finger, the vow falling with finality from Tom’s lips. He winked at her, and added under his breath, “To eternity and beyond, little witch.”</p><p>“Now, take up your groom’s ring, Minister Dumbledore.”</p><p>He watched as she swallowed and blinked, eyes glittering and lashes wet as she took up his ring with a shaking hand. </p><p>She slid the ring, which contained a piece of her soul, her very own horcrux, onto his finger. He locked her into captivity with his gaze, observing as her lips trembled slightly, repeating each part of the vow solemnly. </p><p>“From this day forward, until death do us part. I pledge thee my soul, and my magic,” she breathed at last as she pushed the ring into his finger. He instantly took hold of her hand, pulling her closer.</p><p>He waved his other hand, vanishing her spilling tears. </p><p>She mouthed the words, “I love you.”</p><p>He thought it back to her, knowing she could hear him through the bond.</p><p>“By the power vested in me by the Ministry of Magic Great Britain, I pronounce you, Mr. and Mrs. Tom Riddle! You may now kiss your witch.”</p><p>From Minister Moon’s wand, a jetbeam of light sparked and encircled them both. The glowing stream seemed to observe them both, sensing and interweaving with their respective auras, before it curled around them once, twice, then tightened, pulling their bodies closer.</p><p>With a devilish smirk, Tom slid his hand behind her head and another around her waist, pulling her close as he kissed her, elation bursting in his chest.</p><p>The taste of her tears was salty and sweet. Cheers burst forth from the audience as they glowed in the light of the spell’s coils, the sealing of the magical marriage rites.</p><p>Above their heads, a great banner unfurled, bearing the symbols of their houses, intertwined, the green serpent of Slytherin wrapping itself around the crimson lion of Gryffindor as it roared.</p><p> </p><p>*******</p><p> </p><p>The dancing and feasting lasted well into the afternoon, until evening began to fall with furious flurries of snow and a sky full of cold, crystalline stars. </p><p>Piksy and Lucky were busy vanishing the countless wedding gifts back to Acheron Place. A pesky branch of mistletoe kept following Hermione and Tom all around the reception, the result of some ill-advised prank.</p><p>The reception was a joyous, albeit political affair, as many of the wedding guests were international leaders and ministry officials, which drained quite a bit of Hermione’s energy in greeting them all.</p><p>Hermione danced with so many wizards, her partners began to blur together throughout the night. No matter who led her around the dance floor, she could feel Tom’s possessive gaze upon her at all times, like the stony eyes of a dragon as it hoards its gold. He had become much  more protective of her than he’d ever been since the night of the election banquet. Although the school year had already begun and they saw less of each other, some nights she would wake and find his red gaze watching her from the shadows, other times she could simply feel him there, astral projecting into their home to ensure she was there, safe.</p><p>He’d become obsessive about protective measures, nearly tearing Acheron Place apart to install complex runestones and blood wards in the foundation, in the walls, combing the Hogwarts library for more sinister forms of protection, those that could hurt any intruders.</p><p>Hermione tried, but failed, to get him to calm down and be reasonable, but he would have none of it. Sometimes, he would feign indifference, shrugging as he lit a cigarette, but she could still see the dangerous glint in his red eyes.</p><p>She constantly assured him that she was powerful enough to take care of herself, as she had already demonstrated.</p><p>”I know you are, darling,” he would murmur, placing his large hands around her waist like a belt. “And I’m going to teach you even more dangerous forms of magic… one day, you and I shall be the most lethal pair to ever walk this earth. Even more powerful than Dumbledore.”</p><p>She knew that Tom already considered himself equal to Dumbledore, but he never voiced that in her presence.</p><p>She was quite exhausted by the time she was finally passed back to Tom for their third dance of the evening.</p><p>“My heels are giving me frightful blisters,” Hermione sighed as she leaned against Tom, letting him support her weight as he glided her across the dance floor.</p><p>“I recall Alphard Black is rather adept at massaging feet,” he said playfully, earning him a disapproving glance. </p><p>“I still don’t know how you knew about that night,” she said, irritation leaked into her tone.</p><p>“Take a wild guess,” he whispered against her hair.</p><p>“I’d rather not.”</p><p>Tom took her chin, tilted her head back, then kissed her softly, instantly melting away her tension and exhaustion. “Merry Christmas, wife,” he whispered softly.</p><p><em> Wife</em>.</p><p>It hadn’t fully set in until he said the word.</p><p>“Wife,” she whispered.</p><p>“Mhmm,” he hummed, a deep, pleasant sound coming from his chest.</p><p>The way he looked at her sent a thrill through her body, sparking anticipation for the moment when they would finally be alone.</p><p>She laid her head on his chest as they continued to dance.</p><p><em> Wife</em>.</p><p>Mrs. Riddle.</p><p>The few glasses of champagne she had in her system began to work their potency, but nothing was as intoxicating as the realization that she was now married to the wizard who held her.</p><p>The weight of that fact would continue to boggle her mind for months, she was certain.</p><p>“This can’t be real,” she whispered softly. “It feels like I dreamed the past two years.”</p><p>She heard him laugh through his nose. “Then I’ll have to beg you not to wake up.”</p><p>They swayed to the soft melody drifting through the atmosphere. </p><p>“You know, I don’t think I ever told you about the tarot reading I got.”</p><p>His brows furrowed. “Tarot?”</p><p>“Not long before I used the object you made, I was at the Leaky Cauldron with Ron and Harry. This woman approached us… she was French, I believe. She seemed to be some kind of seer… I thought she was a fraud at first, but she read my cards and kept blathering about soulmates.” Hermione sighed. “I suppose she was right.”</p><p>Tom was quiet, stiffening against her. “French, you say?”</p><p>“Mhmm.”</p><p>Tom’s eyes narrowed. “Did she give you a name?”</p><p>Hermione paused, realizing the reading had been nearly two years prior and though she recalled the reading itself, she hardly remembered the woman’s name. “I believe it was… Madame something.”</p><p>“Madame Violette.”</p><p>Hermione withdrew suddenly, gazing up at Tom. “Yes… I believe that was it.”</p><p>“Interesting.”</p><p>When she scanned his face questioningly, he smiled down at her, masking his uncertainty. “I’ve simply heard the name before.”</p><p>“How odd,” she muttered, brows furrowed. “Try to remember where, if you can. That night always made me uneasy.”</p><p>His eyes narrowed as he rested his chin on the top of her head, descending deep into thought.</p><p> </p><p>********</p><p> </p><p>After a few more dances, and greeting another round of guests, Hermione slipped away, leaving Tom in the company of Slughorn as they discussed the upcoming school term.</p><p>Hermione suddenly felt a rush of impulsion and she ran out of the Great Hall and into the hallway where she had once knelt at the base of the stairs, crying to Harry about Ron.</p><p>She had fought with Ron once there, after the Yule Ball, because he’d been jealous of Krum.</p><p>She fought with him a second time, when she had sent her birds after him. That time, she had been the jealous one.</p><p>She stared at the bottom stair, realizing that it looked as it always had, despite the fact that she was in the past.</p><p>It had been destroyed during the Battle.</p><p>Hermione felt a presence approaching, and it came to stand beside her.</p><p>A presence that had always been a stabilizing figure in her life, but at the same time, a ghost, a wraith. </p><p>The Legend that was Albus Dumbledore.</p><p>Now, he was her family. The only family she had.</p><p>“Are you well, Hermione?”</p><p>“Yes, Albus,” she uttered in a tight whisper.</p><p>“Do you feel… regretful?”</p><p>She blinked, then shook her head. “No… I just feel strange. As if I’ve lived too many lives in twenty years.”</p><p>Dumbledore chuckled. “Imagine how many you will feel you’ve lived when you’re my age. Oh, you’ll feel very strange indeed.”</p><p>Hermione stared at the step, eyes shining. “I love you, Albus.”</p><p>Dumbledore smiled sadly. “But you love him more. There is no one to rival that kind of love… not even a pretend father.” </p><p>She turned to him, eyes wet and glistening, and he winked.</p><p>Hermione reached out and touched his face, his skin which was beginning to wrinkle, and his beard, auburn, peppered with gray. Then, she hugged him.</p><p>Dumbledore slipped his arms around her and tightened his embrace, feeling morosely as though he were losing his second great love.</p><p>“Miss Granger,” he muttered, throat hoarse. “What a surprise you have been.”</p><p>“I’m afraid I’ll only keep surprising you. I am a Dumbledore, after all.”</p><p>“So the fates have decided,” he rumbled gruffly. “Yes… we Dumbledores have always been full of surprises.”</p><p>Hermione cried.</p><p>Dumbledore held her for another moment, before she pulled away. </p><p>“I don’t know why I’m crying,” she sighed.</p><p>“Because,” he mused. “This is a full circle moment. You have now married the man whom you swore to destroy… the very wizard whom you did destroy, once upon a time in the future. And now you’ve realized a very terrifying truth about life… that our experiences do mold and shape us for better or for worse… that our decisions have consequences, that our paths are variable and incredibly complex, and our relationships contain great value… even the ability to change history entirely. One bad decision could condemn millions of people.  One good decision could save an entire generation. Yes, Hermione, every word you speak and every decision you make is very, very important, though they may seem minuscule, in the moment.”</p><p>Silence hung in the air as they each digested his words. </p><p>“I’m scared,” she whispered finally. “I feel the way I felt when I was on the run. I feel blind, like I can’t see. Am I passing, or am I failing the test?”</p><p>A rich vibration came from Dumbledore’s chest. “We all feel that way, Hermione. Nothing is certain. We are all muddling through in the dark.” Dumbledore sighed heavily. “I daresay you’re afraid because you’ve realized that there are no true villains… and there are no true heroes, either. We are all somewhere in between, leaning this way and that.”</p><p>Silence fell once more.</p><p>“I’m going to tell you something, Hermione,” he continued. “I think it will make things more clear for you.”</p><p>She turned to look at him, and her brown eyes, which bore just the slightest crimson hue, met his brilliant blue eyes. </p><p>He gazed at her earnestly. “You are both blind without each other. Tom is blind because he’s submerged in darkness, searching for a seedling of light. You are blind because you have been only ever engulfed in light. But you are drawn to his darkness, and he is drawn to your light like a moth to a flame. Together, you will direct each other’s path. That is how the fates have written your scrolls.”</p><p>Hermione nodded, processing his words. </p><p>“I once loved someone who was submerged in darkness… but I hadn’t enough light in me to balance him.” Dumbledore flicked his eyes at Hermione. “Perhaps Tom is not the only dark wizard you’re meant to save, Hermione.”</p><p>“You are not a dark wizard, Albus,” she said softly, laying a hand on his arm. “You just battle your own demons, as I do, as we all do.”</p><p>“I hope you’re right, daughter. Sometimes I wonder… but I <em> am </em> trying my best. That is all that I can do, I’ve learned.”</p><p>She turned to the man she now called father. “Please be kind to him. Please… try to be his friend. You’ll see him often… perhaps more than I will.”</p><p>Dumbledore peered up the winding staircase. Ironically, it led to the astronomy tower.</p><p>Hermione realized that Dumbledore was always gazing upward, while everyone else’s eyes were always fixed on the bottom stair.</p><p>She turned her gaze upward, following his line of sight. She wanted to see what Dumbledore saw. </p><p>Perhaps one day, she would.</p><p>“Friends,” he muttered. “Too few of those, these days.”</p><p>She smiled. “Who needs friends when you’ve got family?”</p><p>Dumbledore’s eyes twinkled, and a genuine laugh escaped his chest. She was glad to see him happy, instead of sad. She hooked her arm with his and they turned back to the party.</p><p>He winked as they strode back toward the Great Hall. “Who needs friends,” he chuckled. “When you’ve got your very own Phoenix?”</p><p><br/>
***********</p><p> </p><p>Walburga Black strode down the cobblestone street in Diagon Alley, arm in arm with Druella Rosier. </p><p>Neither of them talked about where Druella’s brother had been that week. The entire Rosier family was still in an uproar over his engagement to the half-blood, Winnie Haywood.</p><p>“I like Winnie,” whispered Druella conspiratorially. “Really, I do. I think she would make him happy… it’s just that he’s to <em> inherit </em> everything. The future of the family hinges on his choices. Rosier blood will be tainted for centuries to come. Father is <em> furious </em>. But he’s afraid if he denies Edward his wedding, he might do something drastic.”</p><p>“It’s absolutely shameful, Dru,” said Walburga coldly. “I wouldn’t encourage it… maybe he will still change his mind.”</p><p>The day was the eve of New Year’s, and Walburga had gone out for a few last minute errands, since the Black family would gather that night at Grimmauld Place to celebrate.</p><p>As they passed The Daily Prophet, Druella stopped at the corner stand and lifted up a copy of the newspaper, eyeing the headlines.</p><p>
<b> <em>Newlyweds Honeymoon on the Isle of Avalon! </em> </b>
</p><p>The front page bore a moving photograph of the witch who was now Hermione Riddle, Minister for Magic, with her new husband, Tom Riddle. In the photograph, they kissed happily in the Great Hall at Hogwarts.</p><p>“Oi, what a gown,” murmured Druella as she eyed Hermione’s wedding dress.</p><p>Walburga wrinkled her nose. “Disgusting. Can you imagine marrying a blood traitor? A muggle sympathizer? It’s absolutely outrageous… and to think, Riddle used to be quite hostile toward muggles.”</p><p>“True.” Druella cut her eyes toward Walburga. “I’d assumed you would be more upset about this.”</p><p>Walburga glanced at her friend, then back at the photograph. Beneath it, there was another photograph of the couple, sheltering beneath an umbrella on the Black Barge, ferrying to the island of apples.</p><p>She shrugged. “He’s always been handsome… but I’d never look twice at a half-blood.”</p><p>Druella’s brows drew forward, creasing slightly between them as she looked at Walburga with an expression of confusion and amazement.</p><p>“Well, I suppose that’s good, then. You are engaged, after all.”</p><p>“Speaking of which… How are you and Cygnus getting on lately?” Walburga asked, nudging her friend. </p><p>“Quite well,” Druella said with a secret smile, her cheeks pinking slightly. </p><p>Walburga chuckled, then she flicked her eyes back to the paper. “I don’t know what it is about her,” Walburga muttered venomously. “But I just <em> despise </em> her.”</p><p>Druella cocked a brow. “Everyone already knows that.” She gazed at the moving photograph. “Isn’t it strange that Tom married her? Cygnus asked Abraxas about it, but he won’t talk about Tom. What’s happened?”</p><p>Walburga snatched the paper from Druella’s hand and threw it in the bin nearby. “No idea. Maybe he didn’t lose his arm to a Chimaera hunt after all… maybe Tom cut it off.”</p><p>“Oh, <em> sure</em>, because he would do that to his best friend.”</p><p>Walburga shrugged. “I certainly wouldn’t think he’d marry a <em>muggle </em><em>apologist</em> either, but here we are.”</p><p>She marched off, her heeled boots clicking on the sidewalk, leaving Druella to catch up.</p><p> </p><p>***********</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Abraxas Malfoy rolled over in bed. His head pounded as the mid-morning sun shone in his eyes, brutal and unforgiving.</p><p>He felt around along the top of his night table, and when he located his Hornbeam wand, he grasped it tightly and waved it, drawing the curtains to block out the light.</p><p>He blinked several times, willing his hangover to subside.</p><p>It was January 1st, 1950, and the new decade had just begun. Abraxas had more reason than ever to be hopeful about the occasion, but couldn’t shake the sense of fear and foreboding he felt. It was a dark storm cloud following him, a sinister vapor that clung to his skin.</p><p>He stared at the voluminous canopy of his four poster bed, trying to flex his left arm, but the magic that ran through the prosthetic wasn’t yet strong enough.</p><p>He’d sought out the best Healers in Britain, those who specialized in these kinds of injuries. They had side-eyed him when he said it was a Chimaera attack, flicking their eyes at his mother but wisely stayed silent.</p><p>Abraxas wasn’t stupid. He had memories of the attack, sure, but he could put the pieces together.</p><p>Tom had done this to his arm. He must’ve sawed the mark clean off.</p><p>He knew this partly because he had a large gap in his memory from the night they’d planned to kidnap Hermione Dumbledore.</p><p>Macnair was gone. Completely disappeared, without a trace. The DMLE was still investigating, but there were no leads.</p><p>Abraxas had no memory of what had happened that night, save for a letter he’d received a mere two days after. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> My condolences about the attack and your arm. Wishing you a speedy recovery.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> What a stroke of luck that it wasn’t your duelling arm. You’ll certainly be needing that in the future. I imagine it will only be a matter of time. </em>
</p><p>
<em> You are hereby freed of your obligations to the Heir. You might spend your time brushing up on defensive magic and acquiring allies. </em>
</p><p>
<em> You will need them. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Insincerely,  </em>
</p><p>
<em> LV </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Yes, it was Tom who did this. What was worse, his memory was entirely wiped, so he had no information as to how the night had gone. </p><p>He had spoken with Walburga, but her confusion let him know that she had suffered a similar fate.</p><p>Yet, it was clear that they had not succeeded. Hermione had been sworn in as Minister for Magic. Tom had begun his first term as Defense Against the Dark Arts professor that past September, and just a few short months later, only days prior, in fact, Tom and Hermione had been married.</p><p>Everything they had hoped to prevent, was now taking place.</p><p>Dolohov and Macnair had essentially disappeared. Malfoy spent the first month consoling the families. He’d stood in the same room with all of the heirs of the twenty-eight, and his eyes met Edward Rosier’s from across the room.</p><p>There was dissension among their group, many of his friends were torn between Tom and their birthrights, everything that was owed them as heirs of the ancient bloodlines.</p><p>It was up to Abraxas to unite them, to pull them back in… but at what cost?</p><p>Tom certainly couldn’t kill them all.</p><p>Macnair’s family now wore black in devotion to their son, vowing to do so until he was found.</p><p>Malfoy had a sinking feeling that they would never find him.</p><p>Why had Tom kept him alive? Why leave Walburga? </p><p>No matter how much he racked his brain, he couldn’t fathom why Tom would have sent such a foreboding letter, rather than end him.</p><p>He wanted to believe that there were still some remnants of comraderie left between them, but deep down, he had little hope of it.</p><p>Tom had demonstrated that he had no great love for Malfoy. Abraxas knew that he had essentially fallen into the role of servant, and that the love he had hoped would bloom between them had been fading for years beneath the shadow of Tom’s ambitions.</p><p>Malfoy realized that he had already resigned himself to that reality long ago. If Tom had no true fealty to him, that was alright. He could accept it, if it meant that they were at least working toward a common goal. </p><p>The fight to keep bloodlines pure.</p><p>The cause of ridding their superior world of muggleborns and, by extension, the influence of muggles.</p><p>He’d even dared to hope that they might bring down the statute that kept wizardkind in the dark, preventing them from becoming the ruling class of the entire world.</p><p>Wizards, after all, were equal to the Olympians.</p><p>Muggles were mere mortals. They were built for subservience.</p><p>Abraxas had been told that in drawing rooms and private quidditch boxes by a revolving door of elite and wealthy witches and wizards since he was a boy. If the most powerful people in his world believed such things, then they must be true, mustn’t they?</p><p>In his mind, the riffraff just didn’t care for the truth. He wouldn’t have liked it either, if he’d been born a mudblood. </p><p>But he hadn’t. He was a Malfoy, born and bred into magical excellence.</p><p>It was his duty to preserve the aristocracy of his wizarding bloodline and <em>all</em> pure bloodlines. </p><p>After all… if that went to hell, what then would be left?</p><p>Who would be left in control?</p><p>Mudbloods. They would fill the seats in the Wizengamot, the Ministerial office, they would educate his children.</p><p>Salazar forbid!</p><p>Would that Tom would’ve had the entire lot of mudbloods wiped out with that beast of Slytherin’s. Abraxas missed the days when Tom told him secrets, and their eyes would meet every time the Chamber of Secrets was mentioned, those dark eyes of Tom’s flaring wide while he watched the mudbloods cower in fear. </p><p>He missed the way that Tom’s lips quirked when Angus Kettleburn came into Potions class sporting nasty burns, the result of an organized prank that had been obliviated away.</p><p>He’d watched Tom practice his memory charms that way. No one in their year was better than Tom, not even their professors.</p><p>He had been the foremost entity in all of Tom’s plans, his staunchest supporter. </p><p>It still pained him to think of the night they’d smoked Veela leaves for the first time in the Slytherin boys’ washroom, how they’d become so euphoric, their hallucinations so intense that Malfoy had attempted to kiss Tom.</p><p>Tom, who was sitting with one knee bent on the sink, had pushed him away, had given him a disapproving glance, then broke out into laughter.</p><p>“Save your prim and proper cock for one of the Greengrass sisters. They’ll give you perfect pureblood babies. I can’t... for more reasons than one.”</p><p>Malfoy had watched him get up to leave, his eyes glazed over, Tom sparkling in a dreamlike haze. “I don’t think that matters to me anymore.”</p><p>Tom snorted. “Of course it does. You’re a Malfoy. It <em>has</em> to matter to you.”</p><p>Abraxas was quiet. It <em>did</em> matter to him.</p><p>But so did <em>Tom</em>.</p><p>Tom gazed at him, eyes narrowed, before leaning down to mutter, “I <em>need</em> it to matter to you. Do you know what matters to me?”</p><p>“Magic?”</p><p>Tom sucked his bottom lip in with his teeth, biting down before he hissed, “<em>Power</em>.”</p><p>He hated thinking back on the night.</p><p>Now that Abraxas knew that he’d royally fucked up, he’d been thinking quite a bit of Tom and the past.</p><p>He was afraid. Oh, yes, he was terrified of Tom.</p><p>He’d hoped Tom would be on his side throughout life, but it was clear they were becoming at odds with one another.</p><p>He hadn’t wanted to move against Hermione, nor Tom. Truly, he hadn’t.</p><p>He liked Dumbledore’s daughter immensely, despite himself. He didn’t even blame Tom for wanting her.</p><p>But his Malfoy blood was thick with the weight of generations past, his ancestors driving him forward.</p><p>They’d roll in their graves to know he’d almost thrown away his legacy for a half-blood like Tom.</p><p>Now, Abraxas knew for certain that Tom truly didn’t care for their ancient families, their pure bloodlines, their legacies as wizards.</p><p>He only cared about his legacy.</p><p>If the fast dwindling blood of the twenty-eight truly mattered to Tom, he wouldn’t have ended Macnair like he had. He’d sufficiently snuffed out the singular heir of one of the twenty-eight families, like it was a candle. Abraxas had spent many days and nights at their family estate, gathered there in mourning with the Blacks, the Rosiers, a great coagulating of all of the families.</p><p>To them, it was one of the most monumental tragedies of modern history.</p><p>No, Tom would never understand that. How could he? Half-blood as he was?</p><p>He’d never known his family, and he was the last of his bloodline.</p><p>Abraxas lowered his head into his hands, swallowing thickly.</p><p>Tom was married, and Abraxas felt incredibly alone.</p><p>When had he begun to feel this way? </p><p>Even Malfoy Manor seemed to have an icy chill in the air these days.</p><p>He sighed, running his slender, uncalloused fingers through his pale hair.</p><p>He needed to get married. Yes, perhaps that was the cure for his ache. Perhaps, procuring an heir for the Malfoy line would make him feel better, more secure.</p><p>He was terrified that Tom only intended to prolong his inevitable death. Imagine the portraits in Malfoy Manor ending with Abraxas. Who would take over then? A Black?</p><p>Tom was right on that front… the pool had grown dangerously shallow.</p><p>Abraxas stood on shaky legs and moved across the room to take up a crystal decanter of firewhiskey from the inside of his armoire.</p><p>He often cured his hangovers with more alcohol. It wasn’t very Malfoy of him, but he wasn’t feeling very <em>Malfoy</em> lately.</p><p>He caught a movement out of the corner of his eye, and in his still-inebriated state, his reaction was delayed. He jumped to the side as his heart leapt into his throat, lifting his wand.</p><p>“Salazar! Who the fuck are you?”</p><p>He trained his wand on a woman who sat in the corner of his room, legs crossed, smoothing her robes with her hands, boasting perfectly manicured nails.</p><p>Her eyes lifted up to gaze at Malfoy.</p><p>There was something unnerving about the witch. </p><p><em>Was</em> she a witch?</p><p>Abraxas felt his heart rate increasing by the second.</p><p>“Hello, Mr. Malfoy.”</p><p>What a strange accent, he noted. It potentially bore the lilt belonging to the French, but indeed it was difficult to place, and Abraxas had many connections throughout Europe. He’d studied eight languages, but failed to place her strange manner of pronunciation.</p><p>Her eyes seemed to shift. Were they blue? Green?</p><p>Black?</p><p>Abraxas cocked his head, looking around to see if they were truly alone.</p><p>“How did you get past the blood wards on this estate?”</p><p>She smirked. At first, he thought she looked older, but as he looked at her now, she seemed to grow younger, the lines of her face softening, her hair smoothing.</p><p>What kind of sorcery was this?</p><p>It didn’t seem to be any kind of transfiguration Abraxas had ever witnessed before.</p><p>“I have no blood,” the woman said softly, “therefore your wards cannot keep me out.”</p><p>The pale hair on Abraxas’ arms stood on end. He only just realized that he was only in his boxers, his chest and legs completely bare.</p><p>He stared at the woman for a moment before replying, “We have runestones embedded in the foundation of this Manor, and you don’t look like a ghost to me.”</p><p>She smiled, her teeth glinting menacingly in the meager light. “You are right, dear Abraxas. I am neither living, nor dead.”</p><p>Her eyes shifted again.</p><p>“Then what are you, and why the devil are you in my bedroom?”</p><p>She stood, and he noted how tall she was.</p><p>Statuesque, like a goddess. Bold, emanating power.</p><p>“Some know me as Violette, but, less famously, perhaps, I am also known by another name.”</p><p>“Are you a witch?”</p><p>She cocked her head, and her hair shifted to a brilliant gold, with a slight overtone of red. “I was a witch, once.”</p><p>Abraxas’ brows furrowed slightly, once again noticing a change in her accent.</p><p>He was as entranced by the entity before him as he was alarmed.</p><p>“Who are you, then, and where did you come from?”</p><p>She moved forward a step, seeming almost to float, and he lifted his wand instinctually. </p><p>She tilted her head, giving him a mysterious smile, before she held out her hand and uncurled her fingers, instantly summoning his wand into her waiting palm.</p><p>“It won’t do to curse me, Mr. Malfoy,” she said with a hint of amusement as she twisted his wand between her fingers. “Your magic won’t work on me.”</p><p>Abraxas’ silver eyes widened, betraying a shred of fear. “What do you want?”</p><p>She closed the distance between them and leaned in close, until her breath fell against his ear like a preternatural wind. Her voice was chilling and poisonous, but seductive all the same. Abraxas found himself mesmerized by its cadence.</p><p>“My name is Aikaterine. You and I are going to help one another, Abraxas.”</p><p><br/>

<p>Chapter End Notes</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Read below for my final comments and for info about Book 2: Aeternus</p><p>What a journey it has been writing this fic! I’m a bit in shock and a bit sad that its finally finished. I’ve never written anything this long nor this quickly in my life, but I’ve never been so motivated and sure about a plot as I have been with this story. It was truly magical to write, and I will forever be obsessed with the vibes of this fic. I’m sure there are plenty of things I would change in retrospect, but overall, considering it was my return to writing after many years, I’m very proud of it.</p><p>I want to thank you all for the overwhelming support - it really means the world to me. I treasure every comment, every kudos, especially all of you that have followed this story since last May and gave feedback consistently... Thank you from the bottom of my heart!</p><p>Book Two update: The work is already posted, and I will be actively updating it moving forward. Feel free to visit Aeternus and hit subscribe, and follow along!</p><p>For those of you who may want hints or have questions about Aikaterine, the chapter to revisit would be Chapter 46: Roses and Revenge.</p><p>Other wips!</p><p>The Dream Seer: I never thought I would write a dramione but here we are! I’m very excited about this story as I don’t think there’s another Draco quite like this one 💚</p><p>La Belle et la Bête (it’s a Volmione fic based on Beauty and the Beast, which may not be for everyone, but I think the tension is exquisite… you might surprise yourself 😅).</p><p>Teacher’s Pest: a Professor Riddle Tomione, slightly darker than Invictus (I have been updating this more slowly to give priority to my other wips)</p><p>As for future stories, I do have a couple more tomiones planned including a Hogwarts-era Tomione, but it is on the back burner for now, and then of course, books 2 &amp; 3 of the Invictus series (Severed Souls). Yes, 3… 🥲</p><p>I might choose to write a second epilogue of Hermione &amp; Tom’s honeymoon on Avalon, but we will see!</p><p>I’ve gotten many questions about translations and binds, so I’ll address those here:</p><p>Binding Policy: Binds for personal use are acceptable, as long as there is no profit being made whatsoever. Gifting is permitted, but commissions (any exchange of monetary compensation) are not.</p><p>Translation: Translations are permitted, but full credit must be given to me as the author in the fic’s description / front page as well as a link back to the original work. The translated copy cannot be put behind any sort of paywall. If you do translate my story, please send me the link.</p><p>Podfic: Recordings are permitted, please reach out to me first. (I do believe someone is currently recording a podfic for Invictus)</p><p>Follow me for more updates on my writings:<br/>Instagram: greyanawrites<br/>Tiktok: greyanawrites</p><p>I do believe those are all the housekeeping items.</p><p>Take care all you lovely readers!<br/>We’ll meet again soon, in 1959.</p><p>🖤🤍🖤,<br/>Greyana</p></blockquote>

<p>Good morning! I’ve gotten lots of questions regarding binds and art since this story has completed, so I’d like to include some art below that can be used for binds.</p><blockquote>

<strong>Covers for a two-volume bind:</strong>
</p>
<p>It was @6Luciole idea to create separate covers for a two volume bind, so these can be used for that purpose. Thank you for the lovely art Elodie 💚</p>

</p><p><br/>***********<br/><br/></p><p>All of the art posted in this fic was commissioned by me and I have given my permission to use in binds. </p><p>The inserts/graphics were also designed by me and can also be used in binds.</p><p>Please do not post any art on social media without giving credit to the fic and artist.</p><p>If you find any other art for this fic that is posted publicly on the internet, please do ask the artist for their permission before using in binds.</p><p>Just a reminder: fanfiction is free and must remain free! Do not ever bind fanfics for any kind of monetary compensation, even if it is the cost of materials. Doing so puts authors at risk of being sued, and also endangers the community, putting fanfiction at risk of being made illegal. There are so many binding accounts out there on social media, and there are amazing Facebook groups dedicated to teaching the craft. Getting involved in the community is the fun part! </p><p>If you post your binds on social media, please tag me (@greyanawrites)! I would love to see your work 💚 This fic is LONG, kudos to any of you who attempt it 👏🏼</p><p>Much love,</p><p>Greyana</p><p> </p>
